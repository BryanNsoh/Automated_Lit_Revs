    studies. Introduction Abrupt changes in land use and land cover (LULC), anthropogenic
    activities, and alterations in climatic conditions are the primary drivers of
    hydrological extremes worldwide. Extreme precipitation, glacier lake outbursts,
    and dam failure often cause floods, which may increase with climate change (Acquaotta
    et al. 2019; Begam & Sen 2019; Harrison et al. 2018). Prolonged water inundation
    and flash floods damage natural resources and infrastructure, cause human life
    loss, reduce soil fertility, degrade agricultural and dependent socio-economy,
    ecosystems, biodiversity, habitat, etc. (Díaz et al. 2019; Weiskopf et al. 2020;
    Prakash et al. 2023). Anthropogenic landscape modifications via unsustainable
    land use practices, construction/developmental activities in the flood plains,
    alteration in river morphology, streams, floodplains, etc., determine the impact
    of floods on the course and consequences in different parts of a river basin (Dar
    et al. 2019). Several studies have assessed and predicted flood-related economic
    losses and damage to human well-being in India and elsewhere (Borah et al. 2023;
    Venkataramanan et al. 2019). Extreme flood events affect approximately 21 million
    people globally, which may increase to 54 million by 2030 due to climate change
    and socioeconomic growth (Luo et al. 2015). According to Patankar (2019), 278
    flood events occurred between 1980 and 2017 in India, causing a loss of 58.7 billion
    USD and affecting 750 million people. Gangopadhyay et al. (2018) reported that
    flood cause around USD 7500 million in economic losses annually in India. Human
    life and economic losses due to catastrophic floods can be avoided using advanced
    early warning systems and modern techniques. The timely availability of flood
    inundation maps is essential for minimizing flood hazards, planning and providing
    emergency services, developing mitigation plans, and baseline data layers for
    policymakers. Satellite remote sensing effectively monitors surface water bodies
    and flood inundation by employing suitable spectral bands in the electromagnetic
    spectrum and providing a synoptic view in near real-time and past conditions (Das
    et al. 2021a). Simultaneously, geostatistical analysis employing the spatial layers
    of pre-flood LULC conditions, road networks, human settlements, topography, etc.,
    enables flood hazard assessment and aids in relief, preparedness, and prevention
    efforts. Moreover, sophisticated analyses and hydrological models (e.g. 1D-2D
    MIKE FLOOD, HEC-RAS, and Global Flood Monitoring System [GFMS]) allow the simulation
    of the flood extent and quantify impact assessment (Kumar et al. 2020). The accuracy
    and consistency of flood inundation mapping using remote sensing data relies on
    suitable sensors, operating wavelengths, and adopted approaches. Although water
    identification and flood inundation assessment are easier with optical satellite
    data, there are inherent problems in obtaining cloud-free satellite images during
    the peak flood period, that is, the monsoon season. In contrast, microwave data
    have a relative advantage over optical data, as longer-wavelength microwave signals
    can penetrate clouds and enable surface feature mapping. Active microwave sensors
    capture backscatter signals from the terrain, which vary based on multiple terrain
    conditions and surface parameters, such as the roughness and dielectric constant.
    Waterbodies have a smooth surface (lower roughness) and a higher dielectric constant,
    which causes significantly lower backscatter from waterbodies than other land
    surface features and enables the identification of waterbodies in microwave data
    (Borah et al. 2018). The latest Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data,
    freely available in the public domain, allows for systematic water inundation
    mapping at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The availability of pre-processed
    and rectified SAR data in platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) enables
    bulk data processing for a large region in a shorter time (in minutes) without
    downloading the actual image tiles (Das et al. 2021b; Prakash et al. 2023). Several
    methods have been developed for water inundation area mapping using SAR data,
    such as thresholding, clustering, and deep learning, which discriminate water
    bodies from other land surface features (Mudi et al. 2022; Borah et al. 2018;
    Konapala et al. 2021; Pandey et al. 2022). Otsu’s algorithm is one of the most
    robust methods for automated surface-water area mapping in the absence of reference
    observations. This approach identifies an intensity threshold value derived from
    the radiometric histogram, categorizing images into two classes: foreground and
    background (Otsu 1979). The threshold value was estimated by minimizing intraclass
    intensity or interclass variance. Several studies have employed this algorithm
    for surface water inundation area mapping and reported high accuracy (Mudi et
    al. 2022; Prakash et al. 2023). Soil erosion is a complex process influenced by
    various geomorphological factors and has a detrimental effect on soil fertility
    and crop production. Many studies have shown that soil erosion in a watershed
    is primarily regulated by drainage characteristics such as stream, drainage density,
    flow accumulation, topography, and soil characteristics (Arabameri et al. 2020;
    Bhattacharya et al. 2020; Khatun et al. 2022). Additionally, intense agriculture,
    overgrazing, and LULC changes, including deforestation, urbanization, and loss
    of surface waterbodies (ponds and lakes), intensify surface runoff and lead to
    higher soil erosion (Das et al. 2018; Prashanth et al. 2023; Rather et al. 2017).
    Smolíková et al. (2016) studied the debris flow in the Smědavská hora Mt, Czech
    Republic, and reported that antecedent precipitation index (API) and extreme precipitation
    regulate the nature of debris flow. The study of drainage characteristics has
    proven to be highly effective and has been widely employed in soil erosion studies.
    The morphometric features, such as stream orders, basin area, perimeter, and length
    of streams, are used to assess the impact of stream characteristics on land surface
    processes at a watershed or sub-watershed scale. Satellite data-derived digital
    elevation models (DEM) are widely used to characterize topographic complexity
    and derive drainage networks, watershed boundaries, and various morphometric indicators.
    Several studies have evaluated soil erosion susceptibility at the sub-watershed
    scale in order to develop sustainable watershed management plans (Bhattacharya
    et al. 2020; Mosavi et al. 2022). Precipitation, surface runoff, land surface
    features, soil type, and topographic variables mostly regulates the soil erosion
    and deposition or source-to-sink sediment transport in a watershed. In addition,
    flooding in river basins is one of the major drivers of soil erosion (Mishra et
    al. 2022; Bordoloi et al. 2020). Previous studies have employed multicriteria
    analysis (MCA) for soil erosion susceptibility mapping, wherein they analyzed
    the LULC and morphometric indicators of the sub-watersheds for comparative assessment
    (Altaf et al. 2014; Rather et al. 2017). Bhattacharya et al. (2020) employed four
    multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods as VlseKriterijumska optimizacija
    I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to
    ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighting (SAW), compound factor (CF),
    and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for soil erosion susceptibility
    analysis. Pradhan et al. (2020) assessed the soil erosion susceptibility in the
    Kosi River basin in the Indian state of Bihar using the Revised Universal Soil
    Loss Equation (RUSLE) model soil loss estimation followed by Analytical Hierarchical
    Process (AHP) multicriteria evaluation (MCE) for integration with other variables
    such as soil and morphometric indicators. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
    models have gained popularity in diverse data analyses, including natural hazard
    modeling (Chapi et al. 2017; Khosravi et al. 2019; Towfiqul Islam et al. 2021).
    ML algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, can
    be trained to learn patterns and relations from historical data and make predictions
    based on these patterns. Mosavi et al. (2020) used multiple methods, including
    generalized linear model (GLM), flexible discriminate analyses (FDA), multivariate
    adaptive regression spline (MARS), random forest (RF), and their ensemble employing
    a set of drivers to assess soil erosion susceptibility by analyzing the field
    data on flood events. Their study identified LULC, elevation, aspect, distance
    to the river, and soil depth as the most important variables for soil erosion.
    In complex mountainous regions, such as the Himalayas, flood inundation area mapping
    and soil erosion susceptibility evaluation are critical because of their linkages
    to landslides and debris flow. This study was conducted in the Indian state of
    Assam, which experiences annual recurrent flooding. Previous studies aggregated
    multiple indicators related to soil, morphometric parameters, and LULC at the
    sub-watershed scale to assess soil erosion susceptibility. In contrast, this study
    attempted to analyze soil erosion susceptibility by adding a finer-resolution
    flood occurrence layer from 2017 to 2021. We employed the GEE platform for quick
    and near-real-time flood mapping and ML algorithms for flood hazard mapping. The
    AHP–MCE technique was applied to integrate multiple layers and estimate soil erosion
    susceptibility. Study area The study area is located in the Indian state of Assam
    between 88.25° E and 96.00° E longitude and 24.50° N and 28.00° N latitude. Assam’s
    major rivers include the Brahmaputra, Barak, Manas, and Subansiri rivers. The
    total area of Assam State is ~ 78,438 km2, of which 56,194 km2 and 22,244 km2
    are occupied by the Brahmaputra and Barak River basins (Govt. for Assam and Water
    Resources). The Brahmaputra River is a snow- and rain-fed river that flows continuously
    throughout the year. The total population of Assam is more than 30 million, mostly
    living along the Brahmaputra River floodplain and primarily dependent on agriculture
    and allied sectors for sustenance. In addition, the study region is home to several
    national parks, such as Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
    in the Eastern Himalayas, an ecologically important region. The Brahmaputra Basin
    experiences recurrent floods and is vulnerable to climate change due to its close
    association with the Himalayas, high population, and agricultural dependency (Sharma
    et al. 2018). Moreover, the higher rates of deforestation, shifting cultivation,
    and other LULC changes have significantly modified the hydrology of northeast
    India (Patidar et al. 2022). High river discharges cause significant changes in
    riverbank erosion (lateral erosion) and river channel morphology. The deposition
    of the sediment load of the Brahmaputra Delta is the largest in the world, covering
    an area of 1.76 million km2. Each year, flooding has caused the deposition of
    the sediment load by 1060 m into the Brahmaputra Delta and the Indian Ocean, signifying
    one of the largest fluvial sediment depositions in the world (Milliman and Farnsworth
    2011). According to Rashtriya Barh Ayog, the 10-year flood-prone area in Assam
    accounts for approximately 45.36% of the total geographic area of the state. The
    flood risk assessment conducted by Bhuyan et al. (2023) in the Nagaon district,
    located in the flood plain of the Brahmaputra River indicated above 90% of the
    population living in moderate to high-flood risk zones. Past studies reported
    changes in the socio-economy, reduction in annual income, and population migration
    in the Brahmaputra flood plain, including the indigenous community in Majuli Island,
    one of the world’s largest inhabited river-made islands due to recurrent floods
    and erosion (Chaliha et al. 2012; Das 2016; Roy et al. 2020; Saikia 2022). The
    flood assessment conducted by Mudi et al. (2022) identified an average of 1600
    km2 of water inundation in cropland and 200 km2 in settlement areas in the Assam
    state from 2018 to 2020. Whereas the flood impact assessment in three Indian states
    (Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal) and Bangladesh in the Ganga–Brahmaputra basin
    in 2020 reported above 23% of the total croplands and 5% of the total settlement
    areas were inundated. Materials and methods Satellite data and derived products
    and flood-causative factor variables Sentinel-1 is a continuous all-weather, day-and-night,
    C-band imaging radar mission that operates at a centre frequency of 5.405 GHz
    with HH + HV, VV + VH, VV, and HH polarization. The interferometric wide-swath
    (250 km) mode provides a high spatial resolution of 10 m. At the equator, the
    two-satellite constellation provides a six-day precise repeat cycle, and the data
    are available in the public domain. Sentinel-1 SAR images (with VV and VH polarization
    bands) from July to September were accessed from 2016 to 2022. The selection of
    data from July to September in our study is primarily due to the convergence of
    factors related to high precipitation and flood susceptibility in India during
    this timeframe. This period corresponds to the monsoon season, marked by heavy
    and consistent rainfall, which significantly contributes to flood events by causing
    rapid runoff and increased river discharge. Historical flood records also indicate
    a heightened flood risk during these months. Sentinel-2 is a constellation of
    two polar-operating satellite boarded sensors operating in the visual range of
    the electromagnetic spectrum. It provides images in 13 spectral bands: four at
    10 m, six at 20 m, and three at 60 m spatial resolution. With two satellites,
    it provides images at five-day intervals at the equator. Complete cloud-free optical
    data are mostly unavailable in the monsoon season. One Sentinel-2 image with the
    least cloud cover from July 2017 was used to validate the flood map generated
    using Sentinel-1 data. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station
    data (CHIRPS) is a 30 + year quasi-global rainfall dataset. CHIRPS incorporates
    0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in situ station data to create gridded
    rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring (Funk
    et al. 2015). CHIRPS uses several ground-based gauge networks, including the Global
    Summary of Day (GSOD), Global Historical Climate Network (GHEN), Southern African
    Science Service Center for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management (SASSCAL),
    and the World Meteorological Organization’s Global Telecommunication System (GTS)
    into CHIRP using a modified inverse distance weighting algorithm (Funk et al.
    2015). CHIRPS is available on daily, pentad, and monthly scales (available at
    ftp://ftp.chg.ucsb.edu/pub/org/chg/products/CHIRPS-2.0/). We used the latest monthly
    CHIRPS Version 2.0 dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°. The Shuttle
    Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM was used to generate topographic layers and
    drainage characteristics. The Void Filled one arc-second available at 30 m resolution
    was accessed from the GEE platform. The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land
    Use Planning (NBSS & LUP) gathered soil properties, such as depth, texture, and
    particle size. The ESRI 10 m global LULC map of 2020 created using Sentinel-2
    imagery was used as an input LULC map. The data were generated using a deep learning
    model trained using over 5 billion hand-labeled Sentinel-2 pixels from over 20,000
    sites spread across the globe’s major biomes. The global tree canopy cover (TCC)
    percentage data with 30 m spatial resolution generated by Hansen et al. (2013)
    was used as input to indicate the percentage of tree cover above 5 m. The TCC%
    map for 2000 and tree canopy cover loss and gain from 2000 to 2019 were used to
    generate the TCC% map for 2019. Flood mapping methodology The thresholding method
    is used for water inundation or flood mapping. Otsu’s thresholding method, a nonparametric
    and unsupervised method that automatically detects the optimal threshold assuming
    a bimodal histogram of pixel values (Otsu 1979), was employed to determine the
    optimal threshold to separate water from non-water pixels image-by-image. This
    method relies on the principle that backscatter values are significantly different
    (lower) from those of non-water pixels (relatively higher). Otsu’s method is primarily
    dependent on the histogram of the image pixels, which creates a binary image grouping
    of water and non-water pixels. The pixels in a given image can be represented
    in L grey levels (1, 2, 3,…,L) written as Eq. (1) (1) where 1, 2, 3,…, and L represent
    the pixels in a given image represented in L grey levels, ni represents the number
    of pixels at level i, and N symbolises the total number of pixels (Tiwari et al.
    2020). The normalised grey-level histogram and probability distribution are expressed
    by Eqs. (2), (3), (4). The optimum threshold (k) was obtained by restraining the
    weighted sum of the intraclass (k) variances of the foreground and background
    pixels. Thus, the criterion function ρ was introduced and defined in Eq. (5):
    (2) Pi represents the probability that a pixel in the image belongs to a specific
    grey level “i.” Ni represents the number of pixels in the image with the grey
    level “i,” and N is the total number of pixels in the image (3) Equation (3) states
    that the probability of a pixel belonging to a particular grey level (Pi) must
    be greater than or equal to zero, ensuring non-negative probabilities. (4) Equation
    (4) states that the sum of all the probabilities (Pi) for all possible grey levels
    “I” must equal 1, indicating that every pixel in the image falls into one of the
    grey levels. (5) and σB2 and σBT2 are expressed as. Equation (5), which introduces
    the variable “k,” it represents the criterion function used to find the optimal
    threshold for separating water from non-water pixels. The objective of Otsu''s
    thresholding method is to maximize this criterion function ρ(k), which is the
    ratio of the interclass variance and the intraclass variance . The threshold “k”
    is selected to maximize the discriminability between water and non-water pixel
    values, automating the threshold determination process for water inundation mapping.
    (6) Otsu’s algorithm was implemented in GEE to automatise water inundation mapping
    using Sentinel-1 data. The permanent water bodies identified in the non-monsoon
    season were used as a reference to demarcate actual water inundation. The generated
    output was downloaded and pre-processed, wherein the scattered and isolated pixels
    were removed, retaining patches with four contiguous pixels as the minimum mapping
    unit (MMU). The normalised difference water index (NDWI) was employed to map surface
    water bodies using Sentinel-2 optical data. The relative surface reflectance differences
    in the green and NIR bands were employed to highlight the surface water bodies.
    ρ ρ ρ ρ (7) ρGreen and ρNIR are the reflectance in the green and NIR bands, respectively.
    Data preparation for flood hazard and soil erosion susceptibility assessment The
    selection of factors that influence or regulate flooding in a region is critical
    for flood hazard modeling. In the present investigation, six major parameters,
    including topography, drainage network, rainfall, soil, LULC, and TCC%, were considered
    to determine the characteristics of flood occurrence (Table 1). Topography, drainage
    patterns, and soil properties directly affect water flow and retention, while
    rainfall is the primary trigger for floods. LULC changes, such as urbanization,
    alter surface runoff patterns, and TCC, representing vegetation cover, influences
    water absorption. These factors are widely recognized in hydrology for their significance
    in flood risk assessment, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of both natural and
    anthropogenic elements influencing flood events. Vector soil data (with attributes
    such as depth, particle size, and texture) were converted into raster layers (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S1). DEM was used to create different topographic layers such as
    slope, aspect, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), and topographic wetness index (TWI)
    (Additional file 2: Fig. S2 and Additional file 3: Fig. S3). Moreover, using the
    hydrology tools in ArcGIS software, two drainage characteristic layers were created
    using DEM, such as the drainage network and flow accumulation (Additional file
    4: Fig. S4). The Euclidean distance tool was employed to create layers on the
    distance between the drainage and drainage density (Additional file 5: Fig. S4).
    A fishnet with a grid size of 1 km was established for the flow accumulation,
    wherein the mean flow accumulation was considered for each grid cell as the representative
    value (Additional file 5: Fig. S5). Furthermore, DEM data were used to demarcate
    the sub-basins, wherein the total precipitation from July to September was obtained
    for different years. The sub-basin precipitation layers were used to create the
    mean precipitation layers for 2016–2018 and 2019–2021 (Additional file 6: Fig.
    S6). The TCC% map of 2019 was constructed using the TCC% map of 2000, and the
    TCC loss and gain were recorded from 2000 to 2019. The TCC% loss was removed,
    and TCC% gains were added to the TCC% map for 2000 to generate the TCC% map for
    2019 (Additional file 7: Fig. S7). All layers were resampled to a 1 km grid cell
    for further processing. Table 1 List of data sources used in this study Full size
    table Machine learning models ML techniques are widely used for classification
    and regression analyses. We applied Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the current study. Random
    Forest is an ensemble learning method proposed by Breiman (2001) that combines
    multiple decision trees to make predictions. In our study, we employed 500 trees
    in the RF model building. The input values for RF include a set of features related
    to topography, drainage network, rainfall, soil properties, land use/land cover,
    and Total Canopy Cover (TCC). Each tree in the forest was constructed using a
    random subset of the training data. During training, the model estimates the out-of-bag
    (OOB) error for each tree, allowing for the evaluation of model performance. RF
    prioritizes critical parameters, such as “ntree,” “mtry,” and variable importance,
    and provides an independent measurement of error prediction (Adam et al. 2014).
    “ntree” is the number of decision trees used in the model, whereas “mtry” controls
    number of input features available to consider at each node. The output values
    from RF are predictions of flood susceptibility, with each tree contributing to
    the final prediction. Support Vector Machine is a classifier that builds a hyperplane
    to separate data into multiple groups. We employed the radial basis function (RBF)
    kernel, known for its effectiveness in SVM applications (Cortes and Vapnik 1995).
    The input values for SVM consist of various features representing topographical,
    hydrological, and environmental attributes. SVM aims to maximize the margin between
    the hyperplane and the nearest data points of either class, known as support vectors.
    The output values of the model are class labels that indicate the predicted flood
    susceptibility of each pixel. The choice of kernel function and kernel parameter
    values, referred to as kernel configuration, significantly affects the SVM performance.
    In addition, the cost, regularization, and gamma parameters were used in model
    tuning. CART is a nonparametric method used for both classification and regression
    tasks. It partitions the input space into smaller, homogenous, and non-overlapping
    subregions by recursively splitting the data based on selected input features.
    In our study, the input values for CART include topographic attributes, drainage
    network characteristics, rainfall data, soil properties, land use/land cover information,
    and Total Canopy Cover (TCC). CART considers the interaction among important input
    factors and can capture nonlinear correlations by applying cascaded threshold
    values. Each tree in the CART model evaluates the influential input elements based
    on their contribution to the modeling process (Johnson et al. 2002). When dealing
    with categorical influencing factors, it is important to note that each category
    is treated as a separate input variable in tree-based models. The complexity parameter
    (cp) prevents excessive splitting of the decision tree, which is used to prune
    the CART model. A very low cp value leads to overfitting, while a large value
    leads to small tree. Flood hazard and soil erosion susceptibility mapping The
    overall methodology flowcharts for flood hazard and soil erosion susceptibility
    mapping are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Fig. 1 Overall methodology flowchart
    for flood susceptibility mapping Full size image Fig. 2 Overall methodology flowchart
    for soil erosion susceptibility mapping Full size image The water-inundated areas
    mapped during 2016–2018 were used to develop ML models for flood hazard analysis.
    Three machine learning algorithms, RF, SVM, and CART, were applied. The flood
    occurrence map for 2016–2018 was converted into point vector data, wherein 1000
    flooded points and 1000 non-flooded points were randomly selected for model building.
    The approach considered the water inundated areas, wherein flooding frequency
    was not considered. The flood and non-flood occurrence data points were segregated
    into training and testing sets (70% and 30% of the total data points, respectively).
    The training data points were used to develop the models, and the testing data
    points were used to validate the modeling accuracy. A second round of model validation
    was executed. The three ML model predicted maps were validated with the flood
    occurrence data of 2019 to 2021, wherein 2000 random data points (1000 points
    for flooded and 1000 points for non-flooded regions) were collected from the flood
    occurrence map. The ML models were executed in R programming platform, wherein
    the ‘caret’ package was used for RF and SVM model building and ‘rpart’ for CART
    model building. tenfold cross-validation was applied. A maximum of 500 trees was
    employed in the RF modeling, wherein, the mtry value was iterated within a range
    of 0–20. The ‘radial’ kernal function was applied in the SVM model, wherein the
    gamma function was iterated for the highest prediction accuracy. Similarly, the
    cp parameter in the CART model was tuned to obtained the best prediction model.
    MCE–AHP was applied to soil erosion susceptibility analysis. The input layers
    which caused soil erosion due to water inundation were integrated. The AHP method
    was used to assign weights to the factors evaluated in this study. The AHP method
    is a semi-quantitative MCDM technique in which pairwise assessment of diverse
    elements results in conclusions. The factors were scaled to a uniform range of
    0–1, based on their potential for soil erosion. The data processing included the
    hierarchical ordering of the driving factors, assigning a score to each factor
    based on its relative relevance, creating a pair-wise comparison matrix, computing
    the weight of each factor, and consistency checking. The factors were then integrated
    by applying the derived weights to the factors using the following formula (Eq.
    8): (8) where F is a factor, W is the weight, and i is the factor number. The
    soil erosion susceptibility map generated using MCE assigns a susceptibility score
    to different land areas based on various factors contributing to soil erosion.
    A pairwise comparison matrix was prepared, wherein the relative preferences were
    determined based on expert opinions and references to various past studies. Results
    Flood inundation mapping The water inundation areas were identified using SAR
    data from July to September 2016–2018 by applying Otsu’s method, as shown in Fig.
    3. The total area that experienced water inundation is listed in Table 2. The
    maximum water inundation in Assam was recorded in 2020 (~ 3710 km2), followed
    by 2017 (~ 3035 km2). Water inundation in 2016, 2019, and 2021 was identified
    as ~ 2244 km2, 2650 km2, and 1800 km2, respectively. The least water inundation
    was recorded in 2018, at ~ 1533 km2. The water inundation area identified by applying
    Otsu’s method to Sentinel-1 SAR data was compared with the Sentinel-2 optical
    data-derived normalized difference water index (NDWI) map for July 2017 (Additional
    file 8: Fig. S8). The comparison showed that Otsu’s method captured the water-inundated
    area well using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Moreover, Otsu''s method was applied to map
    the recent water inundation (third week of May 2022) and validate the performance
    of this method. Several ground data points collected from the flooded region in
    May 2022 were used to verify the identified water-inundated areas (Additional
    file 9: Fig. S9). Most of the flood-inundated areas were identified along the
    floodplains of the Brahmaputra River and are mainly croplands (Fig. 3 and Additional
    file 7: Fig. S7(i)). The flooded areas identified during 2016–2018 and 2019–2021
    were overlaid on the LULC map to assess the flood impact (Table 3). The results
    showed that the majority of flood inundation affected croplands (> 3000 km2),
    followed by bareland (including the sand deposit in the flood plain) (> 1200 km2),
    scrub (> 400 km2), and built-up areas (> 130 km2). The percentage area showed
    that average 11.5% of the total cropland in Assam were flooded in 2016–2018, which
    increased to 13.26% in 2019–2021. Similarly, an average 1.31% of the total built-up
    area in Assam were flooded in 2016–2018, which increased to 1.39% in 2019–2021.
    Most of the flooded vegetation class (vegetation cover in the floodplain) experienced
    water inundation (> 23%). In comparison, forest cover (i.e. trees) was least impacted
    (< 100 km2), as most of the total forest area in Assam is situated at a higher
    altitude. However, the bareland and scrubland along the river floodplain were
    flooded annually. Fig. 3 Flood occurrence maps (i) 2016–2018 and (ii) 2019–2021

    size table Table 3 Flood-affected LULC areas in km2 (in % of the class area) Full
    size table Flood hazard mapping Three ML models, SVM, RF, and CART, were applied
    to generate the flood hazard map in Assam. In the RF model, the mtry value of
    8 indicated the highest prediction accuracy. A gamma function value of 0.248 and
    cp value of 0.01 showed the highest prediction accuracy in the SVM and CART model,
    respectively. The model validation with testing data indicated the highest prediction
    accuracy for the RF model (overall accuracy [OA]: 82.91%; Kappa: 0.66) followed
    by SVM (OA: 82.23%; Kappa: 0.64) and CART (OA: 81.9%; Kappa: 0.64) (Table 4).
    Randomly collected training data points from the 2019 to 2021 flood occurrence
    maps were used to validate the performances of the three ML models. The assessment
    indicated the highest accuracy for CART (OA: 83.37%; Kappa: 0.67), followed by
    RF (OA: 82.36%; Kappa: 0.65) and SVM (OA: 81.15%; Kappa: 0.62). The variable importance
    of the RF model indicated the differential role of drivers in estimating flood
    hazards (Additional file 10: Fig. S10). Vegetation cover (TCC), LULC, and river
    network were identified as the three most important variables in flood hazard
    mapping. Comparatively, a moderate influence was observed from flow accumulation,
    elevation, precipitation, and distance from the river. In contrast, lower importance
    was observed for TRI, slope, particle size, TWI, soil depth, and soil texture
    (Additional file 10: Fig. S10). Table 4 Modeling accuracy in predicting flood
    hazard mapping [OA: Overall Accuracy] Full size table The water inundation areas
    identified in 2019, 2020, and 2021, were 2651 km2, 3711 km2, and 1801 km2, respectively.
    The identified water-inundated areas during 2019–2021 were overlaid on the predicted
    flood hazard maps generated using RF, SVM, and CART (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). It can
    be observed that the flood risk areas identified by the three ML models are similar.
    It shows a nearly complete overlap between the predicted flood susceptible map
    and observed flood occurrence maps of 2019, 2020, and 2021. However, the flood
    susceptible area by the ML models overpredicted the actual flood occurrence area.
    The least flood susceptible area was predicted by the RF model (20,719 km2), which
    was comparatively higher in the SVM (27,510 km2) and significantly higher in the
    CART model (50,192 km2) (Table 5). The least flood-prone area identified by the
    RF model showed complete overlap with the predicted areas of the SVM and CART
    models. This study indicates that at least 26% of the area is flood-prone, mostly
    along the Bramhaputra River floodplain. The flood hazard map generated by the
    National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) is based on the flood occurrence identified
    in satellite data from 1998 to 2007 (https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/thematic/thematic/index.php),
    indicating a high resemblance with the current study. Fig. 4 (i) RF predicted

    Full size table Soil erosion susceptibility mapping The relative weights of the
    determinant variables for the soil erosion susceptibility mapping are listed in
    Table 6. The weights were consistent with those of previous studies, with consistency
    ratios below 0.1. The soil erosion susceptibility map shows the relative susceptibility
    of different areas to soil erosion, with darker colors representing higher-risk
    areas (Fig. 7). The maximum importance was assigned to flood occurrence (0.20),
    TCC% (0.15), LULC (0.12), and Distance to Stream (0.1), as these factors contributed
    more to soil erosion. In contrast, variables such as Soil Depth (0.065), River
    Network Density (0.032), precipitation (0.015), TWI (0.013), and TRI (0.012) have
    a relatively lower contribution to soil erosion. Based on the resulting map, it
    is possible to identify areas at a higher risk of soil erosion and prioritize
    measures to prevent soil erosion in those areas. The maximum area (> 41% of the
    total area) showed potential for high soil erosion, followed by moderate soil
    erosion in > 25% of the total area (Table 7). Severe and low soil erosion were
    predicted in approximately 21% and 13% of the total area, respectively. The resultant
    map indicates a higher risk of soil erosion in croplands in the Brahmaputra River
    floodplain due to periodic flooding. In addition, the southern part of Assam (Cachar,
    Karimgunj, and Hailakandi districts) is vulnerable to severe soil erosion due
    to recurrent flooding. In comparison, lower soil erosion was predicted in forested
    regions with higher tree canopy density. The spatial distribution of soil erosion
    susceptibility maps can be valuable for land-use planning, soil erosion prevention
    and conservation, sustainable agricultural planning, land degradation studies,
    and other environmental management activities. Table 6 Weight computed using the

    Discussion Satellite remote sensing, geospatial technologies, and the GEE platform
    were efficient and effective in identifying flood-inundated areas and risk assessment.
    This study used microwave and optical satellite images for flood mapping and validation
    at a high spatial resolution over the past seven years. The flood-inundated area
    identified in different years corroborates the areas reported in previous studies
    (Pandey et al. 2022; Mudi et al. 2022). The ML algorithms were competent in recognizing
    the factors influencing flooding in the study area. Overall, by comparing the
    results, it is evident that RF outperformed the other two models (CART and SVM).
    The superior performance of the RF model can be attributed to its ensemble of
    hundreds of decision trees. The flood hazard maps of the three ML models predicted
    similar patterns, with the lowest area predicted by RF and the highest by the
    CART model. The areas identified as susceptible to flood by the RF model may experience
    recurrent flooding during the monsoon season, which is pertinent for sustainable
    landscape management and flood mitigation planning. Most flood occurrences were
    observed in cropland floodplain areas of the Brahmaputra River, which have a low
    tree canopy density. The river network density was measured to show the impact
    of the Brahmaputra River on flood hazards in the region. Flow accumulation, elevation,
    precipitation, and river distance influence flood hazard mapping. In contrast,
    the influences of soil terrain ruggedness, slope, and soil characteristics were
    found to be less important. The flood hazard map of Assam developed by Gupta and
    Dixit (2022) indicated a similar pattern to that observed in the current study.
    They employed a pairwise comparison matrix for weight estimation of the MCA and
    assigned a higher weightage to precipitation, slope, elevation, and distance to
    the river. In comparison, the present study employed ML models that accurately
    identified the roles of various factors and their relative importance. Sachdeva
    and Kumar (2022) assessed flood hazards in the Hojai district, Assam, employing
    multiple ML models (including SVM and RF) and reported good accuracies. Their
    study indicated elevation, distance to the river, precipitation, and vegetation
    density as the major influencing factors. Maiti and Jana (2019) used ML models,
    including SVM, decision tree, and RF, for flood hazard mapping in the Mahanadi
    River Basin in India. They reported an overall accuracy of 81.3% for the RF model,
    similar to the accuracy reported in this study. Singha et al. (2022) also employed
    multiple ML models for flood hazard mapping in part of Assam state and reported
    a higher accuracy for the RF and gradient boosting model (GBM) than for other
    models. Their predicted flood hazard map using the RF model was similar to the
    predicted map in this study. Moreover, the flood hazard map developed by the National
    Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad, closely resembles that of the present
    study (Additional file 10: Fig. S10). The accuracy of soil erosion susceptibility
    mapping is highly dependent on the selection of predictor variables, and identification
    of the most influential factors is essential for developing accurate models. Limited
    research has been conducted to assess soil erosion caused by flooding in Assam.
    This study estimated soil erosion susceptibility due to flooding, where a higher
    weighting was assigned to flood-inundated areas, followed by LULC, river network,
    topography, soil characteristics, and precipitation, as prescribed by previous
    studies in other similar landscapes (Sinshaw et al. 2021; Nekhay et al. 2009;
    Sajedi‐Hosseini et al. 2018). The soil erosion susceptibility map indicates higher
    soil erosion along the floodplain of the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries
    owing to recurrent flooding. Mishra et al. (2022) recently published their findings
    on soil erosion and deposition at Majuli Island of the Brahmaputra River and reported
    that the sedimentary sequences developed by the Brahmaputra River are mud-dominated,
    whereas the Subansiri River has both mud and sand sequences. This is likely due
    to the differential source-to-sink transport of sediments, as the Brahmaputra
    River carries the sediment load for a longer distance than the Subansiri River.
    Their study also found that areas with sand-dominated facies were more vulnerable
    to erosion than mud-dominated facies. Bordoloi et al. (2020) studied the river
    bank erosion linking the recurrent flooding in the Subansiri River for the past
    three decades. Their study indicated significant riverbank erosion and a westward
    shift of the Subansiri River. Field visits revealed severe bank erosion in the
    Brahmaputra River and its tributaries in May 2022, which significantly altered
    the channel morphology by mobilizing channel sediments (Additional file 11: Fig.
    S11). Understanding the relationship between predictor variables and soil erosion
    can help inform effective soil conservation and management strategies, which are
    crucial for sustainable land-use planning and agricultural practices. Studying
    predictor variables in soil erosion susceptibility mapping is a valuable tool
    for addressing soil degradation and promoting sustainable land management practices.
    Flood prevention, increasing the retention capacity of a catchment, and flood-related
    damage reductions are possible through sustainable land-use practices and management,
    improving forest cover, and suitably designing water harvesting (ponds, lakes,
    dams, etc.) and other artificial structures (culverts, bridges, etc.). The flood
    inundation mapping approach built into the GEE platform can be deployed for near-real-time
    automated flood inundation mapping. Moreover, the adopted approach for flood hazard
    and soil erosion susceptibility assessment using novel ML techniques can be deployed
    for periodic assessment. Although the flood susceptibility map was validated with
    periodic water inundation data, the soil erosion potential couldn’t be validated
    due to the lack of publicly available data for the Brahmaputra River basin. The
    adopted approach can be tested in other river basins, for which periodic soil
    erosion data is available in the public domain. Such validation will help in calibrating
    or tuning the assigned weights in soil erosion estimation. The study outcome has
    diverse applications in mitigating flood damage and aid and rescue initiatives
    in this region. Moreover, the spatial layers developed in the current study are
    crucial inputs for long-term planning, conservation practices, agricultural and
    water resource development activities, and framing suitable policies. The study
    outcomes can also be deployed through mobile applications that can help inhabitants
    and managers during flooding. There is potential for improvements in flood mapping
    and hazard assessment using ML techniques to create more effective flood prevention
    and response measures. The study outcome can be integrated into wider-scale disaster
    management systems to improve community resilience to future flooding events.
    Conclusion The publicly available Sentinel-1 SAR with frequent revisits and the
    GEE platform enabled the development of platforms for automated flood inundation
    area mapping in near-real-time (6-days intervals) using ML techniques. The maximum
    water inundation area was recorded in 2020 (~ 3710 km2). The developed approach
    can be operationalized for period monitoring and use in decision-making by overlapping
    with other important data layers such as transport (roads/rails), hospitals, and
    flood relief camp locations. The geostatistical analysis highlighted regions prone
    to soil erosion due to flooding. More than 26% of the area is vulnerable to flood
    hazards, and 41% shows the potential for high soil erosion. Using Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) technologies, this study predicts flood-prone areas in Assam to benefit resource
    managers and planners. The highest prediction accuracy was observed for the RF
    model (82.91%). The current study is also important for farmers, governments,
    and non-government entities related to flood prevention, infrastructure, water
    resource development, landslide studies, soil erosion and land degradation studies,
    climate resilience, sustainable and regenerative agricultural planning, crop and
    nutrition security, and crop and disaster insurance. This study provides data
    suitable for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production, food and
    nutrition security, socioeconomic conditions, ecology, and the environment. This
    study contributes to advancing flood and soil erosion management practices and
    provides a valuable tool for decision-makers. Further studies are required to
    assess the deposition processes of eroded soil from higher altitudes transported
    by surface runoff and river flow. Availability of data and materials The datasets

    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)
    which replaces all pixels with agricultural ET values above the sub-basin-specific
    95th percentile with a value of zero agricultural ET. $${{{{{{{{\\rm{Savings}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{cs}}}}}}}}}=1-\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum

    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

    techniques are of vital importance to bring THz spectroscopy to a maturity level
    to reach practical applications. In this work, we illustrate the use of machine
    learning techniques for THz time-domain spectroscopy assisted by domain knowledge

    to determine the amount of free water on plant leaves, so-called leaf wetness.
    This quantity is important for understanding and predicting plant diseases that
    need leaf wetness for disease development. The overall transmission of 12,000
    distinct water droplet patterns on a plastized leaf was experimentally acquired
    using THz time-domain spectroscopy. We report on key insights of applying decision
    trees and convolutional neural networks to the data using physics-motivated choices.

    The quest to implement societally and industrially relevant applications of THz
    technology is impeded by aspects such as costs and performance as compared to
    alternatives. Despite the wide range of exploratory studies of THz technology
    since the late 1980s, and the numerous suggested applications1, very few products
    exist that use THz-based techniques. Often demonstrators underperform compared
    to a cheaper alternative that already exists or that is conveniently adapted to
    a new application. However, since THz technology is rather new on the market,
    costs will remain high at least for a while. The only promising way out is to
    find a novel application for the technology, which it can almost uniquely serve,
    and for which the business case is strong enough to support the high costs2. In
    this case, its overall performance needs to justify its usage. On the hardware
    side, technological maturity has strongly improved over the last decades, although
    the progress at an integrated level is lagging3. On the software side, despite
    crucial advancements such as model-based analysis that is now widely employed4,
    the limitations are generality, robustness, and speed, which are essential for
    realistic application cases. The agriculture sector is an area where a multitude
    of sensing technologies are employed to aid management decisions. Certainly due
    to this reason, there is a vivid interest in searching for applications in this
    field where THz spectroscopy can make a difference5. Globally, pests and pathogens
    are a big threat to crop production, with yield losses reported in the range of
    9–21%6. For some pathogens, such as water molds and some fungi, the presence or
    absence of free water on the surface of leaves, so-called leaf wetness, is key
    for infection and/or sporulation and is therefore an important parameter in disease
    epidemiology. A famous example is Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of
    late blight, responsible for the Irish Potato Famine in the mid-19th century.
    The development of P. infestans depends on the presence of leaf wetness and the
    surrounding temperature7,8. In ideal circumstances, P. infestans can decimate
    a potato crop in less than 10 days. Control of late blight, as well as that of
    other pests and pathogens, is nowadays mostly done using crop protection products9.
    There is, however, a strong push from policymakers to reduce this. Early detection
    and improved predictions of when and where diseases may be expected can help targeted
    (preventive) measures. Instead of directly detecting the molds, which in the field
    are difficult to observe, predicting leaf wetness during the growth season is
    an important input for decision support systems to advise on spraying crop protection
    products. Terahertz spectroscopy is particularly suited to accurately sense little
    amounts of water and is proven to probe leaf properties10,11,12,13,14. The current
    state-of-the-art uses electrical measurements to infer upon leaf wetness. They
    are, however, not directly performed on a plant leaf and lack interpretability15.
    Other technologies that can sense water, such as visible imaging, will have difficulties
    estimating very small amounts of water due to a lack of contrast. The infrared
    range, on the other hand, contains several strong water absorptions bands, but
    its frequency domain operation will make it difficult to distinguish between surface
    water and water contained inside a leaf, and its shorter wavelength also causes
    more local sensing. Model-based signal processing, e.g., based on the transfer
    matrix method, can be powerful in well-behaved conditions, such as paint layer
    inspection in an automotive paint shop and wafer metrology in a cleanroom16, it
    will not describe well the complex situation at hand of an anisotropic and curved
    plant leaf in a crop canopy exposed to weather conditions. Signal processing using
    a data-based learning method could be the solution in this case. Many other studies
    have used machine learning on THz spectroscopic data17,18,19,20. However, most
    of these studies suffer from a lack of transparency of the used method such that
    the quality of the result is unclear in aspects of generality and reproducibility.
    Here, we report on the application of machine learning models to THz time-domain
    data in order to determine leaf wetness, defined as the weight of a pattern of
    water droplets at the surface of a plant leaf. We explore two distinct methods,
    decision trees and convolutional neural networks, and design the models based
    on our physics-based interpretation of the data. Both methods accurately predict
    leaf wetness, independent of the droplet pattern. We obtain an accuracy of about
    4% when training and testing on an acquired data set of about 10,600 distinct
    droplet patterns. In order to explore the performance of our method on closely
    related data, we test their generality by inferring onto a second acquired data
    set of about 1500 droplet patterns where the leaf material was flipped in the
    beam path. The majorly reduced predictability of 40–50% indicates the sensitivity
    of the models to learning less relevant features. As a solution, we suggest the
    use of physics-informed algorithms, where a model-based constraint may increase
    the correlation with the target variable. The paper is structured as follows:
    “Results” section first discusses the acquired data sets with a physics-based
    interpretation, and subsequently sets forth a didactic approach of applying decision
    trees and convolutional neural networks to these time-domain data and give particular
    emphasis to feature engineering. The generality of the said models is evaluated
    in “Discussion” section, where we have designed three validation cases with increasing
    deviations of the test set as compared the training set. Although from a light–matter-perspective
    these changes are minor, for the used machine learning algorithms they turn out
    to be significant. We eventually list challenges that the proposed sensing method
    will face prior to integration as a demonstrator in a crop canopy. Figure 1 (a)

    droplet pattern. (c) Distribution of the total weight G for data set \\(\\mathscr
    {E}(t)\\). (d) Distribution of the leaf wetness weight g for data set \\(\\mathscr
    {E}(t)\\). Full size image Results The transmitted electric field E(t) of water
    droplet patterns on plasticized plant leaves has been experimentally recorded
    in transmission geometry at THz frequencies (0.1–3 THz) in the time-domain for
    about 12,000 distinct patterns as described in “Methods” (Fig. 1a,b). We like
    to highlight the size of this experimental data set, which is minimally required
    for meaningful training and testing using machine learning algorithms. The data
    set is divided into set \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) for which the droplet patterns
    are deposited on the top side of the leaf sample, and set \\(\\mathscr {E}''(t)\\)
    for which the patterns are on the bottom side of the leaf sample. For the first
    data set, \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\), Fig. 1c shows the distribution of the total
    sample weight G, being the sum of the weight of the plasticized leaf and the leaf
    wetness weight g, whereas Fig. 1d displays the distribution of only g. Both gravimetric
    weights G and g are determined with a scale (see “Methods”). Although a more homogeneous
    distribution would have been preferred for the latter, the deposition technique
    and vertical mount of the leaf sample (see “Methods”) favor small droplets above
    large ones that run down above a given level of g. Fig. 2a shows a given measurement
    series \\(\\textbf{E}_r(t)\\in \\mathscr {E}(t)\\) for selected values of g, which
    visually drastically changes with g. Besides, each \\(E(t)\\in \\textbf{E}_r(t)\\)
    is also related to a given leaf wetness pattern with its droplet size distribution.
    Therefore, spectra E(t) with identical value g may mutually differ. The standard
    deviation \\(\\sigma (t)\\) of \\(\\textbf{E}_r(t)\\) demonstrates that the influence
    of water on E(t) is predominantly present in the range (4, 5) ps, related to a
    single passage of THz radiation through the droplet pattern and leaf sample (Fig.
    2b). However, maybe of more importance for sensing water is the range of E(t)
    where the radiation internally reflects within the water droplets. From simulating
    E(t) using a transfer matrix model, we find that the first internal reflection
    inside droplets shows up in E(t) as a shoulder right after the largest positive
    peak, that is, around 5.5 ps. This can be better visualized through the quantity
    \\(\\xi =E(t)/\\max (E(t))-E_0(t)/\\max (E_0(t))\\) with \\(E_0\\) referring to
    a leaf sample with \\(g=0\\) (see Fig. 2c). When plotting \\(\\xi\\) for the entire
    data set \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) as a function of g (Fig. 2d), this effect shows
    up a fork for low g around 5.5 ps. The ray trajectory in the droplet-plastic-leaf-plastic
    system is, however, sufficiently complex that more subtle features in E(t) cannot
    be uniquely attributed to a specific radiation path. To obtain an accurate prediction
    of the leaf wetness g, we employ two different data-driven methods, decision tree
    regression and convolutional neural networks. For each algorithm, we determine
    the mean absolute error and median percentage difference, defined as the median
    of \\(|g_p-g|/(g + \\epsilon )\\) with the predicted leaf wetness weight \\(g_p\\)
    and small \\(\\epsilon\\) for stability when \\(g\\approx 0\\). Figure 2 (a) Experimentally
    determined \\(E(t)\\in \\textbf{E}_r(t)\\) for selected values of g at ambient
    conditions (see “Methods”). (b) Standard deviation \\(\\sigma (t)\\) of \\(\\textbf{E}_r(t)\\).

    ranges of large variation. (d) \\(\\mathbf {\\xi }\\) vs. g. The inset highlights
    the temporal shift around 5 ps as a function of g. Full size image Decision trees
    The above-described problem to predict \\(g_p\\) from the experimental input matrix
    \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) is equivalent to determining a function f for which holds
    that \\(f: \\mathscr {E}(t) \\rightarrow g\\). We have ascertained that the relation
    between distinct features of \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\), as discussed below, and the
    target variable g is not linear. To evaluate this problem, we choose a decision
    tree method which is proven to work with non-linear mappings f for mid-sized data
    sets such as that of \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\). A decision tree is a supervised machine
    learning method that is shaped as a flowchart in which iterative decisions lead
    to a piece-wise approximation of the target variable (see Fig. 3a for a single
    class and two features \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)). We refer to “Methods” for further
    details. As common for machine learning algorithms, decision trees fit on features
    that are reminiscent of the data. Many reports employing machine learning methods
    on THz time-domain data either first convert to the frequency domain, thereby
    losing crucial spatial information, or simply use all data of the time trace E(t)18,19,21.
    However, points within E(t) are time-correlated and when directly used as features,
    the correlation may hamper determination of the independent effect of each feature
    on the target variable. For this reason, and in order to make the computation
    resource efficient, feature engineering was used to extract the most reminiscent
    features from E(t), which are not temporally correlated. We hereto fit a polynomial
    function of degree n to relevant temporal ranges of E(t) (Fig. 3b), as further
    detailed in “Methods”. n is chosen as small as possible, but large enough to capture
    reminiscent features of E(t) to best predict g. Although visually the fit may
    not seem optimal, for the algorithm it is. Besides the coefficients of the polynomial
    terms, also the beginning of the time window \\(t_{\\text {start}}\\) is added
    as a feature as well as the absolute air humidity a, which has a strong influence
    on E(t). Optimization for the displayed range in Fig. 3b leads to \\(n=11\\) as
    described in “Methods”. The feature vector thus reads [\\(t^0\\), \\(t^1\\), ...,
    \\(t^{11}\\), \\(t_{\\text {start}}\\), a], where \\(t^0\\) is the bias term and
    will be further indicated like that. Among these features there can be, however,
    ones that are mutually correlated and ones that are only a little related to the
    target variable. We use recurrent feature elimination to reduce the dimensionality
    of the feature matrix and enhance the performance of the model, as further detailed
    in “Methods”. Eventually, hyperparameters responsible for the regularization of
    the final ensemble model are determined using 5-fold cross-validation on a training
    set consisting of 85 % of data set \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\). The predictive performance
    of a bagged decision tree as described here and further detailed in the methods
    was evaluated on an unseen test set consisting of 15 % of data set \\(\\mathscr
    {E}(t)\\) and is shown in Fig. 5a. The mean absolute error on \\(g_p\\) is \\(0.35^{+0.17}_{-0.1}\\)
    mg and the median percentage difference is \\(3.4^{+1.5}_{-1} \\%\\). The mean
    inference time is 139 ms (\\(\\sigma = 22\\) ms) per sample using the hardware
    as mentioned in “Methods”. The indicated error bars are motivated in “Discussion”
    . Figure 3 (a) Schematic view of the mechanism of a decision tree. The dots represent

    of filters of layer \\(\\ell\\). Full size image Convolutional neural network
    An artificial neural network is a convenient tool to autonomously discover intricate
    patterns and representations of signals. The simplest neural network predicts
    an output variable \\(y_i\\) given input data \\(X_{train}\\) and known target
    variable \\(y_{train}\\) as in linear regression by learning a mapping function
    \\(f:X_{train} \\rightarrow y_{train}\\). The architecture of such a neural network
    consists of an input layer with input data \\(x_i \\in X_{train}\\) and an output
    layer with output data \\(y_i\\). The real strength of a neural network is, however,
    to find patterns and representations in high-dimensional input data. Hereto, cross-correlations
    between the inputs are learned using so-called perceptrons (artificial neurons)
    that output a latent variable h depending on input \\(x_i\\). Subsequently, an
    activation function, for instance \\(\\varphi (h)=\\max (0,h)\\), is applied to
    h. This has the effect that only neuron output of sufficient importance is fed
    deeper into the network and correlated to the output of neurons in the subsequent
    layer. In this way, the network can learn non-linear relationships beyond the
    simple perceptron model. In case the input can be represented as an image, patterns
    are more effectively learned by using a so-called convolutional neural network
    (CNN). In such a network a small kernel matrix is scanned over the image matrix
    to learn local relations between data points. For pictures, these kernel matrices
    can represent lines and circles, but also more complicated patterns, which are
    learned by the network. In addition, the method also works for correlated 1-dimensional
    signals. The aim here is to construct a CNN, train it on the experimentally acquired
    time-domain data \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\), and compare its performance to predict
    g to prediction using decision trees as discussed in the previous section. For
    the few studies where THz time-domain data is used for CNNs, rarely the full functional
    E(t) is used despite its spectral richness and possibility to effectively augment
    the number of samples as mentioned in “Discussion”20,22,23. A typical CNN consists
    of many layers which can be grouped into a feature extraction part and a regression
    part. The feature extraction part consists of multiple convolutional layers \\(\\ell\\)
    that utilize kernel operations to convolve over the input vector, which enables
    the detection of pertinent features in signal E(t). Early layers reveal the local
    context of signal E(t), whereas deeper layers combine activations of different
    temporal regions to extract the global context of signal E(t). The patterns of
    the kernels are determined through backpropagation as described in “Methods”.
    For each layer, the number of distinct kernels k, also called filters, has been
    empirically chosen as a function of the size of E(t), the complexity of detected
    patterns in E(t), and the condition to keep the network size as small as possible.
    Hence, to capture basic patterns, layer \\(\\ell =1\\) of our CNN has four filters,
    each of dimension \\((1\\times 3)\\) applied to each E(t) of dimension \\((1\\times
    760)\\) (see Fig. 4m). This results in a feature map of dimension \\((1\\times
    760\\times 4)\\). Fig. 4a,g displays the activation of E(t) for \\(g=4\\) and
    15 mg, respectively, that is, the average of the four filters projected onto t.
    Similar to model-based signal processing of E(t)24, CNN shows the largest activation
    in the range around the absolute minimum of E(t) and hence demonstrates the local
    character of this first layer. Batch normalization has been applied after each
    convolutional layer, which normalizes the features during forward propagation.
    This ensures activation throughout a deep network and results in improved convergence
    while it simultaneously works as a regularizer25. A so-called max-pooling layer
    is inserted behind each normalization layer to reduce the network size by downsampling
    the resulting feature maps. Conceptually, this layer structure increases the receptive
    field of each neuron. \\(\\ell\\) should be chosen such that the receptive field
    of neurons in the last layer covers the complete input signal E(t). In our case,
    we empirically evaluated that \\(\\ell =6\\). We can verify the feature extraction
    performance of this architecture by inspecting the activations for two cases of
    \\(g=4\\) and 15 mg (see Fig. 4a–l). With increasing \\(\\ell\\), the activation
    loses its local character and spreads throughout the entire temporal range. The
    concomitant widening and increasing height of the block functions is the effect
    of the max-pooling operations, where every iteration halves the time window and
    eliminates the smallest values. The activation shows that for earlier layers,
    the range (4, 5) ps is of main importance for the network. This is in agreement
    with the earlier observation that the largest amplitude of E(t) varies most with
    g (cf. Fig. 2a), and as such is the most basic pattern of E(t). Interestingly,
    for \\(\\ell =3,4\\) and 5, the activations show increased values also in the
    range (5, 7) ps. As mentioned before, for \\(g<7\\) mg first internal reflections
    within the droplets occur around 5.5 ps. In addition, from modeling E(t) using
    the transfer matrix method, we find that the first internal reflection within
    the leaf material, although strongly damped, occurs around 7 ps. It thus turns
    out that these regions, which have an increased importance from a light–matter
    perspective, are likewise important for a CNN. Moreover, the increased activity
    in other regions makes our CNN sensitive to details of E(t) that can contain aspects
    that are difficult to incorporate into a physical model. Figure 5 Predicted leaf

    neural network, both versus the benchmark leaf wetness weight g. The insets display

    image After feature extraction, regression is performed by a fully connected artificial
    neural network. Hereto, all previous activation layers are flattened to a 1D vector
    consisting of a concatenation of the 64 \\(1\\times 11\\) activations as well
    as the absolute humidity a. The fully connected network consisting of two layers
    subsequently learns the nonlinear relation between determined input features and
    the target variable by minimizing its loss function given by the squared error
    \\(|\\textbf{g} - \\textbf{g}_p|^2\\), with \\(|\\textbf{g}|=|\\textbf{g}_p|=|\\mathscr
    {E}(t)|\\), using gradient descent optimization. The CNN is trained on \\(\\mathscr
    {E}(t)\\) for 300 epochs with a batch size of 128 using a train-test ratio of
    85:15, where an epoch is a single iteration for which the complete training set
    has been (forward and backward) propagated through the network. During training,
    a validation set of \\(10\\%\\) of the training set is used to validate the performance
    after each epoch. Figure 5b graphically shows the performance of the model, having
    a mean absolute error of \\(0.38\\,^{+0.17}_{-0.1}\\) mg and a median percentage
    difference of \\(4.1^{+1.5}_{-1}\\%\\). The mean inference time is 70 ms (\\(\\sigma

    that using two very different data-driven approaches, leaf wetness can be determined
    using THz spectroscopy within a confidence interval of about 3–4%, independent
    of the method. This is well beyond the performance of model-based analysis to
    determine leaf wetness using THz spectroscopy24. Upon comparison to methodologies
    reported for the closely related property of leaf water content12,13,26, we estimate
    that our study, with its large data set and comprehensible approach, gives a realistic
    view of the chances of performing quality control on plants. Although most studies
    on machine learning conclude at this point, we are here interested in the generalizability
    of the models. Therefore, we consider the following further test cases. For case
    I, we use 37 out of the 39 measurement series of dataset \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\),
    train the learning methods according to the same procedure as described, and test
    on the two remaining series \\(\\textbf{E}_{r_1,r_2}\\). Both methods underperform
    as compared to the results shown in Fig. 5, with decision trees having a median
    percentage difference of 8.8% and CNN 6.7% (see Fig. 6a,c). The question thus
    poses about the origin of this decreased performance. The shape of E(t) is both
    determined by g and the droplet patterns, as mentioned before. However, the temporal
    range (4, 5) ps with the largest amplitudes is of leading importance for predicting
    g, and \\(\\min _t \\xi (t)\\approx 5\\) ps manifests a monotonous variation with
    g (see the inset of Fig. 2d), independent of the droplet patterns, both suggesting
    that g predominantly determines E(t). Yet, the values of g of the test set are
    a subset of the range of g on which the models are trained. The effect of droplet
    patterns on E(t), on the other hand, is more subtle and beyond the range of the
    largest amplitudes, as discussed before. We conjecture that the test set contains
    droplet patterns, rather than different values of g, that are unseen to both methods.
    The relative underperformance of decision trees is then probably directly linked
    to its mechanism for which a slight variation in E(t), here due to a different
    pattern, alters the polynomial fits and thus features on which it has been trained.
    CNN on the other hand directly learns regions in E(t) which are of relevance for
    learning g for all trained droplet patterns. Case II considers \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\)
    as well as an additional 1501 time traces E(t), referred to as \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\notin
    \\mathscr {E}(t)\\), for which the droplet pattern is created on the bottom side
    of the leaf sample. Instead of shining on the smooth and reflective top surface
    as for \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\), for \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\) the beam now
    enters the leaf through the dull and rough bottom surface, thereby significantly
    changing E(t) (see inset of Fig. 6). Please note that the droplet pattern is always
    on the emitter side. The methods are trained on a subset of \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\cup
    \\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\) and tested on an unseen subset of the same data set.
    Figure 6b,d shows a similar performance in predicting \\(g_p\\) as when considering
    only \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) (cf. Fig. 5), also indicated by the median percentage
    difference of 4.4% for decision trees and 3.8% for CNN. This indicates that the
    models can extract relevant features within E(t) no matter the underlying leaf
    material. In case III, we train the models on \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) and test
    them on the unseen data set \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\). This would correspond
    to the practical situation where the method has learned based on droplet patterns
    on leaves which physically are not the same as those on which the model is inferred.
    The performance of the methods is rather lousy (Fig. 6e,g), as indicated by the
    median percentage difference of 39 % for decision trees and 50% for CNN. Figure
    6f,h displays the absolute deviation \\(\\Delta =g-g_p\\) grouped according to
    the five measurement series of \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\) as a function of
    the number of acquisition i. Each series starts at low i with \\(g=0\\) after
    which both i and g increase concomitantly. It turns out that \\(\\Delta\\) is
    small at low g and deviates with increasing g. Signatures of droplet patterns
    with small droplets are thus overall well recognized by the models, despite the
    unseen patterns of E(t) due to the flipped leaf. We conjecture that this sensitivity
    may be related to the presence of reminiscent features of E(t) for \\(g<7\\) mg,
    due to internal reflections inside the droplets and leaf material (see “Results”
    ), on which the network can train. These three test cases indicate that the learning
    model needs input training data that are quite close to the data set from which
    will be inferred. Although it is promising that g is well predicted from data
    corresponding to droplet patterns that have not been seen before, unseen variations
    of the leaf material cause changes in E(t) to which the methods are not robust.
    This could be resolved by training the models on data that besides a large variation
    of g and droplet patterns also include a large diversity of leaves. The confidence
    and related error bars of each machine learning model also depend on specific
    parameters that are chosen within the architecture and implementation. For decision
    trees, for instance, we made use of domain knowledge to select four temporal regions
    within E(t). However, a different choice of the temporal intervals will alter
    the optimal polynomial order n, modify the feature vector, and thus the performance
    of the method. For the convolutional neural network, the specific network architecture
    expressed by variables such as the number of layers, filters, and the number of
    epochs significantly varies the performance of the network. For the current data
    set, the quoted performance due to the described variations has an estimated error
    bar of the order of around \\(1.5\\%\\). However, also the data set size is an
    important parameter. Whereas for decision trees 9018 time traces with 11 features
    each gives a significant data set of \\(10^5\\) features to train on, for CNNs
    the final feature size is more difficult to estimate. Although all temporal points
    of \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\) with size (9018, 760) are used as input, feature extraction
    leads to much fewer features than the number of elements of this matrix. By visual
    inspection of the activations (see Fig. 4a–l), we estimate that each E(t) provides
    some \\(10^2\\) patterns reminiscent of g, summed over all feature maps. On the
    other hand, for each E(t) many patterns together are needed for an accurate prediction
    of g, which reduces the feature space from the number estimated before. To clarify
    this point we draw the analogy with having a picture of a cat, where a cat is
    defined by its eyes, ears, tail, fur, etc. Having only one of these features will
    not lead to an accurate prediction of the picture showing a cat. We therefore
    estimate that the total data size on which the CNN trains should be also of the
    order of \\(10^5\\), which is on the low side of what is common for CNNs. The
    performance of the studied method is also determined by the experimental setup.
    The nebulized water does not always entirely end up in the area covered by the
    THz beam, thereby contributing to the measured gravimetric weight that is not
    seen by the THz beam. We expect that these errors are the cause of the horizontal
    lines in Fig. 2d. Additionally, the accuracy of the gravimetric measurements of
    g is rather low, mostly due to natural air convection and air streams caused by
    the nebulizers. However, the leaf cannot be placed in an enclosed box, as then
    the relative humidity gets spatial and temporal fluctuations with drastic consequences
    on E(t). We estimate the absolute error on g between 0.1 and 0.2 mg. Although
    these results indicate that our data-driven approaches provide a performant model
    to determine leaf wetness in a lab setting, the real baptism of fire for the methodology
    should be a test in the application environment. A first change would be to determine
    leaf wetness of water nebulized onto a leaf, instead of onto a plastic sheet attached
    to the leaf. As the analyses are merely sensitive to the influence of the droplet
    pattern to E(t), we estimate that as long as droplets are formed on the leaf,
    the performance of the used algorithms is largely comparable. A leaf wetness sensor
    for the agriculture sector would need to continuously sense leaf wetness during
    the growth season on a representative size of the crop canopy. A reflection geometry
    would be preferred over a transmission one, and instead of a single leaf, many
    leaves will need to be probed simultaneously. In addition, leaves will not be
    clean and flat but occur with a large distribution of appearances. Moreover, the
    air can be highly humid or contain rain, and dust, and the beam path may be (temporally)
    disturbed by passing insects. We estimate that despite the reported performance
    of the algorithms presented in this work, this real setting, which may vary depending
    on the canopy, will be challenging for the described methods. A solution may be
    found in adding model-based constraints to data-driven learning algorithms, which
    may increase correlation to the target variable rather than to less relevant variations
    within the data, as explored in physics-informed neural networks27. Conclusions
    We have studied the application of conventional machine learning methods to THz
    time-domain data to determine leaf wetness. Hereto, we experimentally acquired
    a large data set of 12,000 distinct time domain traces E(t) corresponding to a
    distribution of droplet patterns on plant leaves. Using domain knowledge related
    to the light-matter interaction, we designed and trained a decision tree model
    and a convolutional neural network and gave special attention to feature extraction.
    Both models predict leaf wetness with an accuracy of about 4%. The generalizability
    of the methods was evaluated on unseen datasets with increasing deviations from
    the training set. We observe a similarity between features important for CNN and
    those having a physical interpretation. In conclusion, conventional machine learning
    models can be of additional value when compared to model-based signal processing,
    especially in case the sample configuration is complex and well beyond a multilayer
    structure, although the sensitivity upon input data is an obstacle for practical
    application. Methods Samples The plant material used in this work is Alliaria
    petiolata, also known as garlic mustard. The plant is widely spread in the Netherlands,
    in the wild, and in private gardens. The plant has been grown in the open ground,
    and leaves are harvested in May to June. Of the selected leaf, a circle of 30
    mm diameter is cut and immediately embedded in between two plastic sheets each
    0.08 mm thick to prevent it from fast drying out. The plastic sheets have not
    been sealed at their edges. During the measurement campaign, the leaf naturally
    dried out on the order of \\(18\\%\\) (that is, about 11 mg) in 5 days. This range
    of relative leaf water content corresponds to variations due to well-watered vs.
    severe-drought growth conditions. Experimental setup The optical properties of
    a moistened plant leaf have been obtained by performing THz time-domain transmission
    spectroscopy (Toptica Teraflash Pro). The sample has been put out-of-focus such
    that the THz beam covers the surface area on which water is nebulized. Water droplet
    patterns on the plasticized leaf sample have been created by using two nebulizers
    (Medisana, Inhalator IN 500). The nebulizers are equipped with specially designed
    nozzles and are symmetrically positioned in the plane of incidence and facing
    the sample (see Fig. 1a). The nebulizers are filled with distilled water and have
    been switched on at random to create a wide range of different droplet patterns.
    The gravimetric leaf wetness weight g of the moist sample is recorded simultaneously
    with the THz data. Hereto, the plasticized leaf sample was mounted on a dedicated
    holder attached to a precision scale (Sartorius WZA224-L). In addition, an RGB
    picture is taken from each droplet pattern using an optical camera (Logitech Brio
    4K). Simultaneously, also the absolute air humidity a has been recorded. During
    the entire measurement campaign, which lasted 7 days, the temperature was 25.0  ±
    0.3 \\(^\\circ\\)C, and the relative humidity was \\(42 \\pm 6\\%\\). Training
    and inference of the described models are performed using python libraries Sklearn
    (for Decision trees), TensorFlow (for CNN) on a CPU (Intel i7-7700HQ @ 2.8 GHz),
    using 4/4 cores and multi-threading enabled. Data acquisition Using the experimental
    setup described above, the transmitted electric field E(t) has experimentally
    been determined of a plasticized leaf sample that has been moistened. A measurement
    sequence is divided into separate time slots: 0.5 s for nebulization, 1.0 s waiting
    time where the nebulization cloud deposits itself onto the sample and diffuses
    away from the beam path, and 1.5 s for acquiring 50 averages of E(t), recording
    g and a, and obtaining an RGB picture of the droplet pattern. A measurement series
    starts with a dry plasticized leaf sample, i.e. \\(g=0\\), and ends when a first
    droplet runs down the sample. For a subsequent measurement series, the sample
    is first wiped dry, and remoistened. The THz beam shines onto the upper side of
    the leaf for data contained in \\(\\mathscr {E}(t)\\), whereas it shines onto
    the bottom side of the leaf for data within \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\). In
    both cases, the droplet pattern is directed towards the emitter side. \\(\\mathscr
    {E}(t)\\) contains a total of 10,609 different droplet patterns organized in \\(|r|=39\\)
    measurement series \\(\\textbf{E}_r(t)\\), which all together are acquired within
    5 days. \\(\\mathscr {E}^\\prime(t)\\) contains 1501 patterns recorded in \\(|s|=5\\)
    measurement series \\(\\textbf{E}^\\prime_s(t)\\) acquired within 2 days. Each
    E(t) contains 760 data points and spans a delay of 38 ps. Data processing Decision
    trees Decisions within regression trees use quantitative split criteria such as
    the absolute error (L1-norm) or squared error (L2-norm) to determine the best
    split at a decision point D (see Fig. 3a). A single decision tree is deterministic
    in its prediction, making it prone to overfitting. To overcome this shortcoming,
    an ensemble of simplified trees is used. Each simplified tree independently predicts
    the target value, after which the predictions are averaged. This reduces the variance
    of the model while maintaining the predictive power of the decision trees. Simplifying
    the trees by limiting the seen input data is called bagging and is a well-proven
    method that is capable of learning nonlinear relations between input features
    and the target variable. Due to the simplistic nature of decision trees, inference
    is interpretative and most importantly, ensemble modeling leads to improved robustness
    compared to single estimators. Feature extraction is performed by fitting a polynomial
    function of order n to a selected temporal range m of E(t). As E(t) has a high
    temporal variation, and to keep n low for optimal performance of the method, we
    choose several ranges to capture all relevant patterns of E(t). The standard deviation
    \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\textbf{E}_r(t)\\) is enhanced in the range (4, 22) ps (see
    Fig. 2b) which we split into \\(m=4\\) equal temporal regions (4, 7); (7, 10);
    (15.5, 18.5) and (18.5, 21.5) ps. As E(t) for \\(g=0\\), \\(E_0(t)\\), manifests
    a slight temporal shift due to factors such as leaf water content, air humidity,
    and drift, the onset of all measured traces E(t) occurs at a slightly different
    value of t. To correct for this, the onset of region \\(m=1\\) is determined by
    the slope d/dt of \\(E(t)/\\max (E(t))\\). Hereto, E(t) has been interpolated
    to enhance the temporal precision. Determination of the order n of each range
    has been done using a grid search algorithm, which is a brute-force search of
    a predefined set of options. Hereto, we calculate the L2 loss of the validation
    set after training on \\(n \\in [0, 20]\\). For the four different temporal regions
    of interest we obtain optimal polynomial fits with order \\(n_1 = 11, n_2 = 2,
    n_3 = 4\\), and \\(n_4 = 8\\), respectively. Subsequently, we eliminate recursive
    features from the input features using permutation importance as a ranking criterion28.
    By shuffling a feature column in the input matrix, the correlation between the
    feature and target value is evaluated. As such, features with little correlation
    to the target value are iteratively eliminated, as well as features that are correlated
    to others that already show dependence on the target value. This reduces the number
    of input features and in turn, increases the predictive power of the validation
    set. In this way, the feature vectors obtained by applying the decision tree algorithm
    simultaneously to all regions m read [\\(t^2\\), \\(t^4\\), \\(t_{\\text {start}}\\),
    a], [bias, \\(t^2\\)], [\\(t^1\\), \\(t^2\\)], [bias, \\(t^2\\), \\(t^6\\)], for
    \\(m=1.4\\), respectively. One can see that although both a and \\(t_{\\text {start}}\\)
    are present within the features for \\(m=1\\), they are eliminated from the features
    for \\(m>1\\) due to mutual correlations. To train a generalizable model, we use
    an ensemble of randomized decision trees, opposite to for instance a single tree
    which is prone to overfitting. The randomization is effectuated by the well-established
    principle of bootstrap aggregation (or bagging), where different subsets \\(D_i\\)
    are sampled from training set D with replacement, meaning that the same sample
    can be sampled multiple times. We further optimize the trees by tuning hyperparameters
    that control regularization, including the number of samples per tree \\(\\textsc
    {n\\_samples}\\), the number of features per tree \\(\\textsc {n\\_features}\\),
    and the maximum depth of branches of a tree \\(\\textsc {max\\_depth}\\). After
    optimization of these hyperparameters using the mentioned grid search algorithm,
    we obtain \\(\\textsc {n\\_samples = 2000}\\), and \\(\\textsc {max\\_features}\\)
    turns out to be equal to \\(\\textsc {n\\_features}\\) such that the decision
    tree becomes a bagged decision tree. The minimum number of samples after a split
    is set to 5 to smooth the predicted value of a tree29. Convolutional neural network
    The architecture of the CNN is shown in Fig. 4m. The input data is inserted in
    a concatenation of six groups each containing a convolutional layer. This structure
    is motivated by a receptive field which increases with each deeper layer. Since
    deeper layers learn more complex patterns, the number of filters is increased
    by a factor of two for each layer. Moreover, the convolutional layers are (after
    batch normalization, see below) succeeded by a max-pooling layer that decreases
    the length by a factor of two. Given the kernel dimension \\((1\\times 3)\\) and
    that of the input vector E(t) \\((1\\times 760)\\), we have chosen for zero padding
    the extremes of E(t) with a single entry to have the dimension unaltered after
    convolution. After this feature extraction part, the output is flattened and feature
    \\(\\textbf{a}\\) is appended before inserting it in a two-layer fully connected
    network. The entire network has 72,385 trainable parameters: 26,144 are responsible
    for feature detection and 46,241 for regression. Input data needs to be normalized
    before feeding it into the network to ensure proper convergence during gradient
    descent, as steepest gradient descent algorithms do not possess the property of
    scale invariance. Normalization of the absolute humidity is performed as \\(a_i^\\prime
    = (a_i - \\mu _{a})/\\sigma _{a}\\) where \\(\\mu _{a}\\) is the mean of a with
    respect to the training population and \\(\\sigma _{a}\\) its standard deviation.
    For all E(t), a uniform division factor of 4 is applied to ensure all data points
    are within the range \\((-1, 1)\\). For activation, we make use of the Rectified
    Linear Unit (ReLU) function, defined as \\(\\varphi (h) = \\max (0, h)\\). Convolutional
    networks require supervised learning to learn the intrinsic patterns to predict
    the target value. Supervised deep learning models use backpropagation to autonomously
    shape function f to find relation \\(f:x \\rightarrow y\\), where x is the input
    and y the target. We have used the Adam optimizer to find the optimal model parameters.
    Adam is a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that combines the advantages
    of AdaGrad and RMSProp, resulting in an optimizer that is robust and well-suited
    to a wide range of non-convex optimization problems in the field of machine learning30.

    rice plants. Introduction Rice is an important staple food worldwide. Rice is
    the largest water-consuming crop in the central rice production regions in the
    world, and water scarcity is bound to threaten rice production [1]. Additionally,
    the water consumption in paddy fields would increase significantly due to global
    climate change in the future. The unfavorable factors must aggravate the water
    crisis in rice fields [2, 3]. Leaf water content (LWC) is an important evaluation
    index for crop water demand status [4]. Monitoring LWC effectively achieves precise
    irrigation, improves water utilization, and alleviates the water crisis. Hyperspectral
    remote sensing technology has recently been widely used in agricultural production
    due to its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time monitoring of crop physiological
    and biochemical characteristics [5,6,7]. Early LWC spectral modeling studies improved
    prediction accuracy by constructing various types of vegetation indices from sensitive
    spectral bands, such as the moisture stress index (MSI) and water index (WI) [8,
    9]. Previous spectral monitoring studies have initially focused on vegetation
    indices derived from spectral bands. Researchers construct different vegetation
    indices by spectrally sensitive bands to improve the prediction accuracy of LWC
    [10, 11]. Vegetation indices are frequently screened by selecting spectral information
    and have a good correlation with LWC at multiple points over many years [12, 13],
    but the established models usually ignore the effects of the growing environment
    and growth characteristics on LWC of the crops. Climate characteristics and physiological
    status of the plants are important factors affecting LWC [14, 15]. The neglected
    information could be the primary reason for the poor generalizability of existing
    vegetation index models in practical applications. Therefore, integrating the
    actors into the spectral monitoring models of LWC would be more high precision
    due to considering the potential effects of the growing environment and growth
    characteristics on LWC [16, 17]. Qin et al. [18] have recently improved crop nitrogen
    content prediction accuracy using a spectral model that combines image feature
    parameters and fluorescence parameters. These results supported our inferences
    that introducing multi-source data may be important means to improve the monitoring
    accuracy of LWC spectral modeling in rice plants. Choosing modeling methods are
    one of key steps in building monitoring models. Vegetation index monitoring models
    have been usually established using linear and nonlinear functions [19, 20]. These
    traditional monitoring models do not represent the complex relationship between
    various indicators. Machine learning algorithms with sophisticated functionality
    and the ability to handle complex relationships between predictors and target
    variables can be a good solution to this problem [21, 22]. The accuracy and stability
    of models have significantly improved with the rapid development of machine learning
    algorithms, and these are widely adopted when establishing rice nitrogen nutrition
    monitoring models [23,24,25]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow the
    use of different classes of sample data as input variables, allowing multiple
    sources of data (physiological and ecological indicators and spectral information)
    to be effectively coupled and can effectively discriminate between differences
    in the contributions of the input variables, allowing the model’s parameters can
    be fully utilized. Therefore, we speculated that the monitoring capacities of
    vegetation index models integrating with multi-source data would also have significant
    advantages using machine learning algorithms when predicting the LWC of rice plants
    based on the results previous studies [16, 26]. Three irrigation regimes and four
    varieties with different drought tolerance capacities were established LWC difference
    populations in field experiments. This study’s objectives are to (1) select spectrally
    sensitive bands with high correlation with LWC at multiple growth stages; (2)
    build a new vegetation index model of LWC integrating multi-source data parameters
    after selecting key physiological and ecological indicators; and (3) use a machine
    learning algorithm to optimize the coupling model and select the optimal algorithm
    to monitor the LWC. Materials and methods Site and treatment description Three
    irrigation regimes, including two water-saving irrigation regimes named mild alternate
    dry and wet irrigation (MADW), severe alternate dry and wet irrigation (SADW)
    and traditional irrigation regime (CK), were conducted with four rice cultivars
    in Anhui province of China in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1). The planting and sampling
    plan details and soil characteristics are presented in Table 1. The climate conditions
    are displayed in Fig. 2. The irrigation regimes were conducted when rice seedlings
    were planted in plots. The irrigation criterion referenced the classical definition
    for the MADW and SADW treatments [27]. The supplementary irrigation with 2–3 cm
    water layer was carried out when the soil water potential at 20 cm soil layer
    reached − 15 KPa and − 30 KPa in the MADW and SADW treatments during whole growth
    stages of rice plants, respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. The
    soil water potential of each plot was monitored by a tensiometer (Watermark, Irrometer
    Company Riverside, CA, USA). Moreover, 2–3 cm water later was always maintained
    for the CK treatment during whole growth stages. Generally, 9–14, 5–8, and 18–24
    times irrigated practices were applied for the MADW, SADW, and CK treatments,
    respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. Fig. 1 Sketch of field experiments

    divided into three applications for each treatment: 40% as a basal fertilizer,
    30% at the early tiller stage, and 30% at the panicle differentiation stage. The
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 240 kg ha−1. Phosphorus and potassium
    fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg ha−1 and K2O 225 kg ha−1) were also applied as basal fertilizers.
    Plot sizes for each experiment were 12 m2 and 40 m2 in Hefei and Fuyang, respectively.
    All experimental rows were spaced 30.0 cm apart, and plants in a row were spaced
    13.3 cm apart. Measurements Hyperspectral and vegetation index Canopy reflectance
    spectra of rice plants were collected for the booting, flowering, initial grain
    filling, and middle grain filling stages using spectral scanning equipment (ASD
    Field Spec 4, Boulder, CO, USA). The band amplitude of the device ranged from
    350 to 2500 nm. The measurements were conducted under clear and cloudless sky
    conditions between 10:00 and 14:00 [16]. After measuring 10 times for each sample,
    the average value was calculated, and the reference plate was used to correct
    the instrument every 15 min. The representative hills were monitored in each plot
    for all treatments at each observed time. Numerous vegetation indices have been
    applied to monitoring crop water content. The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) has been widely utilized in monitoring plant water using remote sensing
    methods due to its simple construction and effective improvement of spectral monitoring
    accuracy with multi-band analysis compared with other vegetation indices. Thus,
    this study used canopy spectral data to construct the normalized difference index
    (ND) and five traditional vegetation indices. The calculation equations were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2 List of vegetation indices used in this study Full size table
    SPAD value and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters SPAD value of rice leaves was
    monitored using a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Company, SPAD-520 plus, Japan).
    The average value of the top three fully expanded leaves was defined as the SPAD
    value of the whole plant. The five independent plants were measured in each plot
    across cultivars, water treatments, and observed periods. The leaves used to measure
    SPAD value were chosen, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of rice leaves
    were determined using a portable pulse-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ
    Company, PAM-2500, Germany). These leaves were used to determine the minimum fluorescence
    level (Fo) and the maximum fluorescence level (Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at dawn
    for all cultivars and treatments. The steady-state Fo was measured using far-red
    light with illumination less than 1 mol m−2 s−1. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse
    with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was supplied to determine the Fm. Moreover, the steady-state
    fluorescence yield (Fs) was recorded at the forenoon with clear and cloudless
    sky conditions. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was
    stimulated to obtain the maximal fluorescence level (Fm''). Finally, the maximum
    photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency (Y(II)) were
    calculated: (1) (2) Leaf water content (LWC) The fresh leaf mass (FW) was determined
    by weighing the top three fully expanded leaves immediately. Five hills were sampled
    in each plot for four cultivars and three water treatments during each observed
    period. Fresh leaves were weighed and dried at 80 ℃ to constant weight at each
    sampling. The weight was marked as dry mass (DW). The LWC was calculated as follows:
    (3) Crop water stress index (CWSI) CWSI was calculated as follows [31, 32]: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) where Tc is the crop canopy temperature (℃), and Ta is the air temperature
    (℃). Tmin is the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃),
    Tmax is the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃), and
    VPD is the air saturation water vapor pressure deficit (KPa). VPG is the difference
    between the air saturation water vapor pressure and VPD when the air temperature
    is Ta and (Ta + A), respectively. A and B are linear regression coefficients.
    RH is the relative humidity of air (%). In this study, a HOBO UX100-003 temperature
    and humidity recorder (Onset, USA) was placed in each plot to automatically record
    rice canopy temperature and humidity every 1 h interval throughout the day. Leaf
    area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (Biomass), and Grain yield Five representative
    hills, which plants in the hills had uniform growth capacities, were randomly
    selected from each plot at each sampling time across all cultivars and irrigation
    treatments. The hills with excessively vigorous or weak plants were not sampled
    to minimize sampling error. All green leaves per hill were scanned using a portable
    leaf area meter (CI-203, CID Inc., USA). The averaged leaf area in a each plot
    was then calculated from the five hills and marked with D (cm2). Finally, the
    scanned green leaf, remaining yellow leaves, stem, and panicle organs were dried
    at 80 ℃ to constant weight to assess the biomass of each plot. (8) where ρ is
    the planting density per square meter (hill m−2). Plants from a 2 m2 area were
    harvested at maturity to calculate the actual grain yield with 13.5% moisture
    content in each plot across cultivars and water treatments. Regression models
    Some common and classic machine learning algorithms were preliminary assessed
    to select elite algorithms with high monitoring abilities to LWC of rice plants.
    Finally, the four machine learning algorithms named decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and gradient
    boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) were adopted in this study. The four
    selected methods were successfully applied on estimating various ecological parameters
    such as water content of wheat plants and soil moisture of wheat fields [16, 33].
    In addition, the scikit-learn packages of the four algorithms were from Python
    3.8 software (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) MLR is the most basic and commonly used method for combining two or more
    independent variables that jointly predict or estimate the dependent variable
    [34]. The y is the dependent variable. The x1, x2… xk are the independent variables.
    The multiple linear regression was calculated as follows: (9) where b0 is the
    constant term, e is the error term, and b1, b2… bk are the regression coefficients.
    When x1, x2…, and xk are fixed, b1(k) represents the effect of increase or decrease
    in x1(k) on y for each unit or named the partial regression coefficient of x1(k)
    on y. Decision tree regression (DT) DT is a way to infer classification rules
    as a decision tree from a set of unordered and irregular data, using a top-down
    recursive approach to compare attribute values of nodes inside the decision tree
    [35]. Each internal node is a splitting problem in a decision tree. A test for
    some instance attribute is specified, and it splits the samples arriving at that
    node according to a particular attribute. Each subsequent branch of the node corresponds
    to one of the possible values of that attribute. The prediction results are the
    average values of the output variables in the samples contained in the leaf nodes
    of the regression tree. In this study, the maximum depth of the tree was set as
    10, and the number of trees was 100. Random forest regression (RF) RF resulted
    from random sampling from sample observations and feature variables of the modeled
    data among many decision trees; each sampling result is a tree [36]. Meanwhile,
    each tree generated rules and judgment values that match its properties. Finally,
    the forest algorithm integrated the rules and judgment values of all decision
    trees to achieve random forest regression. K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN)
    KNN was predicted by computing the spatial similarity relationship between the
    k nearest neighbors and the predictor. The algorithm was frequently used for classification
    problems in the early stage and gradually applied to parameter estimation [37].
    The primary principle of the KNN algorithm is that a prediction sample has K nearest
    neighbors in the feature space. Then, the class of the prediction sample was usually
    determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors. The K data set value
    was chosen appropriately according to the samples. The model was simplified, and
    useful information was lost if the data set was too large. Oppositely, the model
    would be over-fitted if the data set is too small. The K data set was defined
    as 3 in this study. Gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) GBDT is
    an improved algorithm based on the booting algorithm [38]. The booting algorithm
    assigned the same weight to each training sample in the initial training and then
    increased the weights of the error points after each training session to generate
    multiple base learners. Finally, these base learners were combined, and the model
    was formed using weighting or voting approaches. The difference between gradient
    boosting tree regression and classification algorithms was that the input training
    data was residual. The previous prediction was incorporated into the residual
    to find the training data for the current round instead of the gradient of the
    loss function. Data analysis and model verification The Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) helps to measure the linear correlation between variables [39]. In this
    study, PCC was simply regarded as supplementary means to eliminate unimportant
    indicators with low correlation coefficient and to obtain eigenvalues with high
    correlation coefficient. This meant that indicators closely related to LWC were
    used to build models to improve performance. After removing invalid samples from
    the two-year experiments from 2021 to 2022, 91 sample data for each growth stage
    were obtained. In multiple linear regression (MLR), 2022 data were used for modeling
    (55), whereas 2021 data were used for validation (36). The measured data were
    randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets in the machine learning
    regression algorithm. The regression model''s accuracy was evaluated using the
    determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The overall
    model was evaluated in the graph, including linear regression and a 1:1 dash-line,
    to determine the relationship between the predicted and measured values. The calculation
    equations are presented in (9)–(10): (10) (11) where is the measured value of
    LWC, is the measured mean value of LWC, is the predicted value of the model, and
    n is the sample size. The larger the R2 value, the better the accuracy of the
    model. The RMSE reflects the degree of dispersion and deviation between the model’s
    predicted and true values. The smaller the value, the better the prediction of
    the model. The workflow of the LWC prediction procedures is illustrated in Fig.
    3. Data preprocessing included the following processes: (1) normal distribution
    test and scatter plots were performed for the original data such as vegetation
    index parameters, leaf water content, and physiological and ecological indexes
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S1–S4). (2) Outliers detection of all parameters were
    shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. (3) The multicollinearity test between ND
    and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI at whole observed stages were
    also adopted by variance inflation factor and tolerance values (Additional file
    1: Table S2). Fig. 3 Flow chart of this study Full size image Results The classical
    and new vegetation index for monitoring LWC The sensitive bands of LWC were analyzed
    and tested using the normalized difference vegetation index formula at the booting,
    flowering, initial grain filling, and middle grain filling stages to improve the
    accuracy of the hyperspectral monitoring model for LWC. The classical vegetation
    indices, such as NDII and MSI, had a significant positive correlation with LWC
    and high predictive abilities (Table 3). The vegetation index ND constructed by
    the screened sensitive bands (1287 and 1673 mm) also had a significant positive
    correlation with LWC (Fig. 4). The R2 in the ND(1287,1673) model was higher than
    that in NDII and MSI vegetation indices at each growth stage. These results indicated
    that vegetation index ND was an optimal predicted model at each growth stage of
    rice plants. The R2 of the linear equation between LWC (y) and ND(1287,1673) (x)
    was 0.48, 0.64, 0.57, and 0.53, and the corresponding prediction R2 was 0.36,
    0.67, 0.64, and 0.52 at the booting, flowering, initial grain filling, and middle
    grain filling stages, respectively (Fig. 5). Table 3 Coefficient of determination

    image The relationship between physiological-ecological indicators and LWC The
    physiological-ecological indicators had obvious effects on LWC at each growth
    stage and yield (Fig. 6). The LWC had the highest correlation with grain yield
    at the booting, flowering, and initial grain filling stages. The LWC is the most
    important parameter that regulates grain yield, especially for different irrigation
    treatments. CWSI had the highest correlation coefficient with LWC (− 0.60 to − 0.85)
    at each observed stage, followed by the Fv/Fm (0.56–0.71) and SPAD (0.53–0.67).
    Therefore, CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD can be considered reliable multi-source data
    to improve the detection accuracy of LWC using the vegetation index model. Fig.

    functions between LWC and ND(1287,1673) at different growth stages (Fig. 5) were
    systematically analyzed using multi-source data, such as SPAD, Fv/Fm, and CWSI
    (Fig. 7). Both a and b have significantly quadratic curve relations with CWSI,
    SPAD, and Fv/Fm. For a parameter, the determination coefficient (R2) of the curves
    reached the highest for the CWSI (R2 = 0.92), followed by the SPAD and Fv/Fm.
    In contrast, Fv/Fm had the greatest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.99), while CWSI
    had the lowest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.37). The results illustrate that SPAD,
    Fv/Fm, and CWSI can be regarded as useful multi-source data to improve the prediction
    capacities of LWC. Fig. 7 The SPAD value (a), Fv/Fm (b), and CWSI (c) at different

    performance of LWC by coupling multi-source data There were no multicollinearity
    between ND and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI based on the tolerance
    and variance inflation factor values (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, Durbin
    Watson test indicated that the established multivariate linear regressed models
    in this study were basically meet the requirements of linear model (Additional
    file 1: Table S2). The indicators CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD were introduced into the
    ND(1287,1673) model to improve the prediction model accuracy of LWC further (Table
    4). The results demonstrated that the ND(1287,1673) model integrating with multi-source
    data enhanced predictive power than the conventional ND(1287,1673) model (Fig.
    5 and Table 4). The coupled models of ND(1287,1673) and CWSI had the best monitoring
    capacity to LWC at the booting and flowering stages (Fig. 8). The R2 improved
    from 0.48–0.64 in conventional ND(1287,1673) models to 0.69–0.75 in the coupled
    models. Prediction R2 also improved from 0.36–0.67 in conventional ND(1287,1673)
    models to 0.65–0.69 in the coupled models at the booting and flowering stages.
    Moreover, the coupling models of ND(1287,1673) and Fv/Fm were optimal at the initial
    and middle grain filling. The R2 and the corresponding prediction R2 improved
    in the coupling models than in conventional ND(1287,1673) models at the initial
    and middle grain filling. Table 4 The ND(1287,1673) models predicting LWC after

    Full size image Discussion Relationship between multi-source data and LWC A suitable
    vegetation index is important to construct an LWC spectral monitoring model in
    smart agriculture. The first important step is to screen the sensitive band. However,
    there are some differences on the selected water-sensitive bands for different
    crops. Thomas et al. [40] discovered a significant correlation between the relative
    water content of cotton leaves and the reflectance values in the near-infrared
    (NIR) bands (1450 and 1930 nm). Yang et al. [41] suggest that the sensitive band
    range of LWC in wheat plants is located in the visible (400–780 nm) and NIR bands
    (1400–2500 nm). This study selected different spectral indices from previous studies
    to establish relationships with rice LWC. However, the correlation was not optimal.
    The ND constructed by the NIR band at 1287 and 1673 nm was instead optimal (Table
    3). This study’s results were inconsistent with those of previous studies. One
    of the important reasons could be that vegetation index models for monitoring
    LWC in our study considered the multiple growth stages of rice plants, rather
    than focusing on a specific growth stage in previous studies. Additionally, the
    spectral data obtained from different ecological sites, climates, and varieties.
    In this study, the varieties were selected for their commonality bands, considering
    the universality of the varieties from which the four rice varieties with a large
    span of validation years and large differences in drought resistance were selected.
    Recently, multi-source data related to environmental factors coupled with the
    spectral monitoring model of LWC has been successfully established in wheat plants
    to reduce the errors caused by environmental and physiological factors during
    the spectral monitoring process [16]. This study used the Pearson correlation
    coefficient method to analyze the physiological and ecological indicators related
    to LWC. Our results displayed that CWSI, Fv/Fm and SPAD would be considered as
    optimized multi-source data because the parameters had a higher correlation with
    LWC compared to other physiological and agronomic indices during whole observed
    periods (Fig. 6). These findings were also consistent with the basic physiological
    laws of plants that the three parameters would be changed with the change of LWC.
    First, the transpiration rate quickly reduces with declining LWC in rice plants
    [42, 43]. A low transpiration rate increases canopy temperature for a short time
    and then fleetly regulates CWSI in the canopy of plants [44, 45]. Second, H2O
    is insufficient to maintain its physiological activities when LWC is low in rice
    plants; the phenomenon quickly downregulates photosynthetic performance, such
    as declining Fv/Fm [46,47,48]. Third, SPAD biosynthesis would be hindered, and
    decomposition could be accelerated if LWC remains low for a long time, resulting
    in the yellowing of leaves [49]. Finally, the fluctuant sensitive parameters lead
    to significant changes in population characteristics, such as leaf area, biomass,
    and yield, presenting different degrees of decline [50]. Therefore, we deduce
    that CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD should be introduced into the spectral monitoring model
    to improve the R2 for monitoring LWC in whole growth stages of rice plants. Coupling
    multi-source data for monitoring rice LWC The canopy structure and growth environment
    of rice have been changing throughout the whole growth period, resulting in different
    spectral reflectance data, making it difficult to accurately build a water prediction
    model for the whole growth period with a single vegetation index model [51]. A
    good relationship between physiological and ecological indicators and spectral
    information is the key to rapid and non-destructive monitoring of coupled multi-source
    data. The relationships between CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD and the slope (a) and intercept
    (b) of the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models were systematically analyzed
    at each observed period to achieve accurate prediction of LWC (Fig. 7). The parameter
    a had the closest relationship with CWSI with R2 of 0.92. However, the parameter
    b had the closest relationship with Fv/Fm with R2 of 0.99. These results indicate
    that the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models could be largely influenced
    by physiological and ecological factors when LWC was monitored using spectroscopic
    equipment. Therefore, slope and intercept could be defined as ecological and physiological
    factors in conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models, especially for monitoring
    LWC in rice plants. This evidence confirms the necessity of incorporating physiological
    parameters into the conventional ND(1287,1673) model to improve LWC monitoring
    accuracy in rice plants. Currently, multi-source data are widely used in hyperspectral
    monitoring. However, most studies have utilized a single type of multi-source
    numbers to construct models independently or in combination, and few studies have
    discussed the effect of coupled multi-source data on the monitoring performance
    of rice LWC models. This study uses a commonly used multiple linear regression
    algorithm to estimate rice LWC based on coupled multi-source data and compare
    its monitoring performance. The results revealed that the monitoring capacities
    in ND(1287,1673) models coupled with physiological and ecological factors were
    significantly increased than conventional ND(1287,1673) models across all observed
    stages (Tables 3 and 4). The coupled model of ND + CWSI and ND + Fv/Fm had the
    best monitoring capacities at the booting to flowering and initial to middle grain
    filling stages, respectively. The different coupled parameters at different growth
    stages may related to the differences in rice growth characteristics. Previous
    studies have demonstrated that the canopy structure is unstable and that leaf
    area and biomass are in a state of constant growth during the booting and flowering
    stages in rice plants [52]. Irrigation regimes directly regulate canopy growth
    and development [53]. Therefore, the canopy micro-ecological factors, such as
    photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and humidity, constantly fluctuate
    [54], especially for different water treatments. Finally, CWSI is a sensitive
    index at this stage because CWSI is mainly regulated by the micro-ecological factor
    [31, 32]. However, rice plants are in the senescence stage after flowering. Leaf
    photosynthetic capacity significantly declines during the grain-filling stage
    compared to pre-flowering in rice plants [43, 55]. Additionally, photosynthetic
    performances are susceptive to different irrigation regimes during senescence
    processes [56]. Fv/Fm is an important index evaluating photosynthetic performance.
    Therefore, photosynthetic performance could be a better multi-source parameter
    to predict LWC during the rice-filling stage. Comparison of machine learning algorithms
    Machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in model monitoring
    research and have become popular tools in precision agricultural production research.
    In this study, four machine learning algorithms, DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT were used
    to perform operations based on coupled models using rice flowering data as an
    example (Table 5). The results indicated that the R2 for the simulation and validation
    sets of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT were 0.80–0.93 and 0.75–0.86, respectively, which
    the R2 of machine learning algorithms were 1.16–1.35 times higher for the simulation
    sets and 1.09–1.25 times higher for the validation sets compared with MLR (Fig.
    10). Among them, GBDT has the highest R2 with low and stable RMSE. Therefore,
    the GBDT model would be considered as the best machine learning algorithm for
    monitoring LWC in this study’s simulating and verification data sets. Previous
    research supports our results that the GBDT algorithm has higher prediction accuracy
    for leaf area in maize plants among the aforementioned algorithms [57]. GBDT can
    improve prediction accuracy by constructing a weak learner to correct the original
    model error via residuals and resultant iterations when the sample size is small
    [58]. The same weights are assigned for each input factor for the other algorithms;
    the algorithm would fail to determine the primary contributing factor in the input
    factor if the training data are insufficient [57]. This may be the primary reason
    the GBDT algorithm has significant advantages to improve LWC monitoring capabilities
    in this study because our sample size could not be abundant enough to support
    the data requirements of other algorithms. In summary, machine learning positively
    improves the monitoring abilities of LWC in rice plants. Future perspectives Factors
    such as fertility period and rice LWC changes lead to parameter differences between
    relevant indicators extracted from various data sources. Current crop monitoring
    models are mostly single-factor statistical models that are difficult to consider
    crop growth and development, yield formation and its interactions with climate
    and soil environment, and lack universality and dynamics. Therefore, coupling
    spectral remote sensing information with multivariate data can construct a spectral
    monitoring model with high accuracy and stable reliability of crop growth, moisture
    content, and other indicators, providing an effective solution to the spectral
    monitoring problem. In this study, only four rice cultivars were considered after
    the booting stage, and the early growth of rice has yet to be monitored. Establishing
    a standardized water stress detection and diagnosis system based on water critical
    thresholds at various growth stages of rice will require the accumulation of data
    from multi-year, multi-point, continuous trials based on different rice variety
    types. This can accurately monitor the LWC to ensure high rice yield, improving
    water resource utilization efficiency and providing a basis for implementing precision
    agriculture. Conclusion In this study, the LWC of rice with different cultivars,
    years, and water treatments was monitored based on multi-source data (physiological
    and ecological indicators and spectral information) with machine learning, explored
    the performance of single and combined multi-source data in LWC monitoring, and
    utilized different physiological indicators to establish two monitoring models
    for the growth differences of rice in the initial and middle stages. The results
    displayed that ND + CWSI had better monitoring performance in the early stage
    (booting to flowering stage), while ND + Fv/Fm was better in the late stage (initial
    to middle grain filling stage). Additionally, this study''s newly constructed
    vegetation index ND(1287,1673) also has good monitoring capacities for LWC in
    rice. Meanwhile, the machine learning algorithm (GBDT) further improves the monitoring
    performance of the model. In summary, this study confirms that using multi-source
    data and machine learning can improve the performance of hyperspectral prediction
    of rice LWC. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analyzed

    06 November 2023 Introduction Recently, the adoption of machine learning methods
    has attained high performance in many computer vision tasks1,2,3. However, machine
    learning methods employ statistical learning algorithms to explore patterns in
    the training subset and then perform predictions and classification on the test
    subset, whereas deep neural networks choose features, provide an end-to-end pipeline
    for automatically extracting robust features, significantly improving the availability
    of leaf identification. On the other hand, the identification of leaf diseases
    is essential for controlling disease spread and improving the healthy development
    of the pear industry4,5,6. However, plant disease prediction is a hard and interconnected
    task that needs different technical skills and experts in the field. The existing
    traditional approaches depend on a specialist or expert in the field to manually
    perform careful analysis of the foliar surface and then perform a diagnosis, but
    these approaches are inefficient in terms of complexity and cost7,8. Therefore,
    the deployment of technology has become necessary for automatically recognizing
    and classifying the plant diseases from the appearance of the first symptoms.
    Machine learning and deep learning approaches have received considerable attention
    recently for the purpose of object identification and classification9. Recently,
    there are several plant leaf diseases approaches that have been proposed10,11,12,
    which are based on the employment of deep neural networks. These approaches showed
    that deep learning approaches have enhanced the classification accuracy in a comparison
    with the machine learning approaches. This is due to the large number of configurable
    parameters in the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), where a substantial
    amount of labelled data is needed to train the model and improve the generalization
    capabilities. The CNN models require enough number of training images in order
    to enhance the generalization capabilities. However, there is a lack of agricultural
    data, particularly in the field of identifying leaf diseases, as the collection
    process of huge disease datasets is inefficient in terms of labor and time, since
    this type of data requires an extensive knowledge in the area of plant diseases.
    In addition, the manual labelling task is a very subjective task, and ensuring
    the quality of the classified data is difficult13. As a result, the lack of training
    samples is the primary constraint to further improvement for the accuracy of leaf
    disease detection. Hence, the problem of train a deep learning model using a small
    amount of labelled data is worth examining. This problem has been addressed using
    the employment of traditional data augmentation methods14. Recently, the adoption
    of data augmentation approaches in computer vision tasks enhances the quality
    of deep learning classification, through obtaining a large size dataset, and hence
    better deep learning models can be trained with the improved datasets15. Therefore,
    since image data is distinct, a new training dataset can be extracted from the
    original image using a simple geometric transformation, including: rotation, scaling,
    translation, cropping, noise addition, and other data augmentation techniques.
    These strategies, however, provide very extra information, and hence improving
    the accuracy for classification objects in a certain area. Several approaches
    have considered the issue of data augmentation to enhance the classification accuracy,
    as presented in10,16,17,18,19, where the most popular approach for training a
    deep CNN model with a small amount of data is to augment the input data with synthetic
    images. In this research work, we designed the Generative Adversarial Network
    (GAN) to obtain new synthetic images that are augmented the training dataset.
    GAN is a machine learning-based approach that is utilized to produce additional
    new samples with similar features to the original samples, in order to be employed
    in the training process. GAN aims to generate entire synthetic images that can
    contribute to increase the dataset’s diversification. Recently, GAN approaches
    have become a standard method for dealing with dataset constraints. On the other
    hand, to mitigate the bias induced by class imbalance, authors of17 proposed a
    new approach to augment synthetic samples named as Activation Reconstruction (AR).
    Unlike the work presented in the previous research works10,16,17,20 which consists
    of 9 different classes with balanced dataset, our research work focuses on the
    same issue with imbalanced dataset. Therefore, our main target is to increase
    the training samples and balance the number of records in each class, in order
    to minimize the model over-fitting, and hence offers high classification accuracy.
    Therefore, in this work, we develop an efficient deep vision classification approach
    for pear plant disease classification through the employment the Cycle GAN, in
    order to increase the number of samples in the selected dataset through producing
    new images, that result in enhancing the classification accuracy. Hence, the main
    contribution of this work lies on the following aspects: 1. Develop a new efficient
    approach that integrates classification with the CycleGAN approach in order to
    resolve the problem of a limited training set. 2. Validate the proposed approach
    through several experiments to assess the performance of the developed system
    in terms of classification accuracy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
    “Related works” section discusses the recent developed pear plant disease classification
    approaches, whereas “System design” section presents and discusses the proposed
    classification system. “Experimental results” section shows the experimental testbeds
    and results, and “Discussion” section discusses the results obtained from several
    experiments that have been conducted to assess the efficiency of the developed
    system. And finally, “Conclusion and future work” section concludes the work presented
    in this paper and draws a future work. Related works This section discusses the
    recent developed plant disease classification approaches detection. Authors of21
    reviews the diseases affecting on 11 different plants and presented how the diseases
    can be identified from plant leaf images using deep CNN learning models. However,
    in this paper, we focus on the problem of classification of pear diseases through
    the employment of deep CNN models. The work presented in22 involves exploring
    the variability factors that impact the classification of plant diseases through
    analyzing the same plant and diseases under different conditions, where 5 different
    approaches including EfficientB0, MobileNetV2, InceptionV2, ResNet50, and VGG16
    have been employed. As a result of this study, authors revealed that the model
    performance drops extremely when using representative datasets, in addition, the
    presented results showed that deep learning is an effective technique for plant
    disease classification. Authors of23 investigated the Convolutional Block Attention
    Module (CBAM) to enhance the classification accuracy of CNN which is a lightweight
    attention module which can be plugged into the CNN architecture with negligible
    overhead. Authors employed several CNN models, including: EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2,
    ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG19 in order to perform transfer learning for plant
    disease classification. As a result, the EfficientnetB0 and CBAM architecture
    obtained 86.89% classification accuracy. In11, authors investigated the ensemble
    learning approach to develop a robust network that is able to predict four different
    pear leaf diseases, where authors employed and analyzed the results of several
    CNN architectures, including: EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and VGG19.
    The work presented in24 involves employing an improved YOLOv4-tiny for the purpose
    of root crop detection using a single-board computer (SBC). The employed method
    allows for processing up to 14 images of 416 × 416 pixels with a result of 86%
    precision and 91% recall. The task of balancing the dataset in deep learning applications
    is a crucial problem that has been researched and addressed in several research
    works, driven by the requirement of a health agricultural yield, whereas cost-effectiveness,
    accuracy, sensitivity, and user-friendliness are all essential considerations.
    Although data augmentation is an effective strategy to deal with limited training
    data, however it is not widely applicable. Because selecting a suitable data augmentation
    technique requires a prior understanding of the target domain and task. Furthermore,
    parametrization of data augmentation methods adds a new set of key hyper-parameters
    that can significantly affect the deep learning method''s inaccuracy. Therefore,
    in order to balance skewed data, authors of19 proposed a data augmentation approach
    through employing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).
    Authors revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved when the number
    of samples in each class is nearly equal (balanced dataset). Authors employed
    a VGG16 CNN model as a classifier to assess the performance of the developed DCGAN
    approach. The experimental results revealed that, with employing the GAN-based
    data augmentation strategies, an increase in the distribution integrity of classes
    in the selected dataset. As presented above, various GAN methods have been employed
    in diverse deep neural network application in order to address the challenge of
    balancing imbalanced datasets. DCGAN on the other hand employs random vector image
    synthesis rather than image translation, which can result in a bottleneck. However,
    with unpaired dataset, DCGAN method does not consider image-to-image translation.
    In addition, large amount of data is necessary for the purpose of improvement
    of the classification accuracy in all of the above approaches, as well as other
    deep learning approaches for various tasks in computer vision so far. Starting
    with a small number of original images and gradually synthesizing additional plant
    disease images synthetically using CycleGAN and feeding those samples to our training
    set using the approach proposed in this study, we may achieve comparable performance.
    System design In order to obtain an efficient classification performance in terms
    of classification accuracy for the purpose of the pear plant diseases categorization
    using a small number of images in the training dataset. This section discusses
    the system design including the design of two different approaches in order to
    assess the efficiency of employing the CycleGAN architecture on the classification
    accuracy. For the purpose of plant disease classification, we discuss various
    deep CNN models which may be employed for the purpose of plant disease classification.
    Recently, there are several deep CNN models that have been developed for the purpose
    of image classification. AlexNet model25 has a total number of 8-layer structure
    with 60 million parameters, whereas VGGNet-1626 consists of a total number of
    16 layers and 7 million parameters. GoogleNet27 on the other hand consists of
    nine inception modules and two max-pooling layers for down-sampling the input
    as its fed forward through the network. The Inception V3, MoibleNetV1 and MobileNetV2
    consist of 27, 4.2, and 3.37 million of parameters, respectively. Table 1 summarizes
    the deep CNN models that have been employed for image classification tasks. Table
    1 Summary of the deep CNN models that have been employed for image classification.
    Full size table For the purpose of improving the classification accuracy, and
    according to several research works28,29,30 that analyzed the performance of several
    deep vision models, we have employed 3 different deep vision models: VGG19, ResNet50
    and EfficientNetB0. The developed system has been implemented through two different
    approaches: the first approach involves developing a plant disease classification
    using the original DiaMOS dataset, whereas in the second approach, we employed
    the CycleGAN method to efficiently increase the size of the DiaMOS dataset. The
    first approach is depicted in Fig. 1, where the DiaMOS dataset is first divided
    into two subsets: training and testing, then train the deep CNN model using 3
    different deep classification models (VGG19, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0) through
    employing the original DiaMOS dataset. Figure 1 The main stages of approach 1.
    Full size image The next approach involves generating new labelled images through
    training the CycleGAN, for two main reasons: balancing the classes in the DiaMOS
    dataset, and increase the size of the DiaMOS dataset in order to obtain better
    classification accuracy, where the new generated images will be added to the original
    image dataset in order to enhance the initial dataset, through incorporating more
    images. Next, the designed CNN model is employed to train using the new generated
    dataset. Figure 2 presents the concept of the second approach, where the integration
    of CycleGAN method is presented before the process of dividing the dataset into
    two subsets. Figure 2 The main stages of approach 2. Full size image In general,
    the CycleGAN architecture consists of two models: the generator model and a discriminator
    model. The generator receives a point from a latent space as an input and produces
    new plausible images from the domain, whereas the discriminator takes an image
    as an input and predicts whether the taken image is a real one (from the DiaMOS
    dataset) or fake (from the generated dataset). On the other hand, transfer learning
    is the reuse of a previously trained network to a new task in deep learning. Transfer
    learning has become popular recently as it allows the network to be trained with
    a minimal quantity of data while retaining high accuracy. A computer leverages
    information from a prior task to boost generalization about the new task in transfer
    learning. The final levels of the trained network are replaced in our approach
    by adding extra layers for the aim of transfer learning, such as adding a fully
    connected layer and a four-class soft-max classification layer. Therefore, we
    added an additional activation layer, batch-normalization layer, and a dropout
    layer. For the experiments, we use the same settings in terms of batch-size and
    learning rates. Experimental results In this section, we discuss the materials
    and methods that been employed to develop an efficient pear plant disease classification
    approach. In addition, we present and discuss the results obtained from two different
    approaches. Therefore, for the purpose of system validation, the first stage includes
    the employment of the three different deep vision models with the DiaMOS dataset,
    and then train each deep vision model separately, whereas in the next stage, new
    labelled images are generated using the CycleGAN approach, where the new generated
    images will be added to the original dataset to build a new dataset with more
    images and balanced classes. The final stage includes employing the deep vision
    models with the new generated dataset. Then a comparative study is provided to
    show the classification accuracy between the original dataset, and the new generated
    dataset through applying the CyleGAN approach. DiaMOS dataset For the purpose
    of system validation, the DiaMOS dataset has been employed in our study. DiaMOS
    dataset is presented in31 and is a recent pear dataset, which consists of 3,505
    images for pear fruit and leaves affected by three different diseases (spot, curl,
    slug), with the aim of saving time and resources for other researchers to allow
    more effort to be paid on the evaluation and comparison of classification algorithms.
    DiaMOS plant is a pilot dataset that contains images of an entire growing season
    of a pear tree, for the purpose of building a representative sample that covers
    the main cultural aspects of the pear plant. Table 2 summarizes the main attributes
    for the DiaMOS dataset. Table 2 General information about the DiaMOS plant dataset.
    Full size table DiaMOS dataset has been employed in diverse plant disease classification
    works7,11,22,23, where DiaMOS dataset consists of four categories: healthy, leaf-spot,
    leaf-curl, and slug damage, as presented in Table 3. Table 3 The distribution
    of classes in the DiaMOS plant dataset. Full size table DiaMOS images were collected
    using different devices, including a smartphone (Honor 6x) and DSRL camera (Canon
    EOS 60D), therefore, DiaMOS dataset consists of two types of image resolutions:
    2976 × 3968 and 3546 × 5184. However, the different resolutions increase the complexity
    of the DiaMOS dataset and represents an added value for the dataset itself. In
    our study, we focus on classifying the pear images into 4 different classes: healthy,
    slug, curl, and spot. DiaMOS dataset has been divided into 3 main parts: training
    subset, validation subset, and testing subset, with the ratio of 70%, 10%, and
    20% respectively. In addition, in order to preserve the balanced percent of each
    class, DiaMOS dataset was split using the ShuffleSplit technique presented in19.
    On the other hand, the dimension for each image in the DiaMOS dataset, was reduced
    to 224 × 224 × 3. Convolutional neural network classifier Convolutional Neural
    Network (CNN) is a type of network architecture for deep learning algorithms which
    is specifically used for image recognition and the tasks that include the processing
    of pixel data. In this work, we employed an efficient CNN model to achieve the
    goal of plant disease recognition. The employed CNN model consists of several
    layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization layers, and
    fully connected layers. In this paper, we have employed the VGG19, ResNet50, Inception-V3,
    MobileNet-V2 and EfficientNetB0 to diagnose the different plant diseases in the
    DiaMOS dataset. The reason behind employing these three models was because of
    their parameter numbers are smaller than other deep CNN models. In addition, these
    models require less computation requirements than other models. CycleGAN The training
    process of deep learning model requires large number of records of paired examples.
    However, in most cases, preparing large datasets are not valid, as with the employed
    DiaMOS dataset. The CycleGAN is a method that involves an autonomous training
    of image-to-image translation models without paired examples using the GAN architecture,
    where these models are trained in an unsupervised approach, using a collection
    of images from the source and target domain that do not require to be related
    in any way. As discussed earlier, DiaMOS dataset contains a small number of records,
    in addition, DiaMOS includes imbalanced data classes, and hence this leads to
    poor plant disease classification performance. Therefore, one of our main goals
    was to increase the size of the DiaMOS dataset and balance the records in each
    class. Figure 3 presents the histogram for the total number of images for each
    class (plant disease) located in the DiaMOS. Figure 3 The distribution of images
    for each class. Full size image Therefore, CycleGAN has been adopted to expand
    the data set size, which had the same number of images. Figure 5 shows an example
    of a real image (left-hand side) and a sample image (right-hand side) generated
    by the regularized GAN architecture. Figure 4 presents an example to one unique
    class that belongs to the healthy class. Figure 4 An original image of a healthy
    class (left-side) and a generated image by GAN (right-side). Full size image Results
    This section discusses the results obtained from two main different scenarios:
    the first one was through adopting the 3 deep vision models with the original
    DiaMOS dataset, whereas the second scenario involves employing the 3 deep models
    with the enlarged DiaMOS dataset after deploying the CycleGAN approach. For both
    scenarios, we estimated the following parameters: 1. Confusion matrix: in general,
    the confusion matrix illustrates the complete performance of the deep classification
    model. 2. Classification accuracy: it refers to the percentage of the total number
    of plant images that were correctly predicted. 3. Precision: it refers to the
    percentage of correctly predicted positive cases over the total predicted positive
    cases. 4. Recall: it refers to the percentage of correctly predicted positive
    cases to all the cases in the real class. 5. F1-score: it refers to the weighted
    average of precision and recall. In certain cases, the F1-score is more useful
    than classification accuracy when the dataset is unbalanced, as with the original
    DiaMOS dataset. First, the results of the confusion matrix are discussed in details.
    Confusion matrix shows the errors that made by the classifier and the types of
    errors that are being made. The confusion matrices are presented first for employing
    the three deep vision models with the original dataset. Table 4 presents the confusion
    matrix for the VGG19 model using the original dataset. As noticed, the average
    misclassification is equal to 29%, which is a high ratio. On the other hand, Table
    5 shows the confusion matrix for the EfficientNetB0 model using the original dataset,
    with a higher misclassification rate of 31%. Finally, Table 6 includes the confusion
    matrix for the ResNet50 model with the original dataset, where a minimum misclassification
    rate was obtained with this model with a percentage of 18%. Therefore, the RestNet50
    classification model achieves the best results in terms of classification accuracy.

    matrices are presented for employing the three deep vision models with CycleGAN
    leaf images dataset. Table 7 presents the confusion matrix for the VGG19 model
    using the CycleGAN architecture. On the other hand, Table 8 presents the confusion
    matrix for the CycleGAN approaching using the ResNet50 model. As noticed, ResNet50
    achieves better classification accuracy than the VGG19 model. And finally, Table
    9 presents the confusion matrix for the EfficientNetB0 model using the CycleGAN
    leaf images. Table 7 Confusion matrix results for the leaf images dataset using
    the VGG19 model. Full size table Table 8 Confusion matrix results for the leaf

    table The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are significant parameters
    that need to be measured for each deep vision model. According to experimental
    studies, ResNet50 offers the best classification accuracy using the original DiaMOS
    dataset. In addition, ResNet50 achieves the best precision, recall, and F1-score
    among the three models. Table 10 summarizes the results of accuracy, precision,
    recall, and F1-score for the three deep vision models using the original dataset.

    dataset. Full size table Table 11 on other hand presents the experimental results
    of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the three deep vision models
    using the CycleGAN leaf images. As noticed, the classification accuracy has improved
    for the ResNet50 model when the CycleGAN leaf images were employed, and this refers
    to the high efficiency of the CycleGNA architecture. Moreover, the precision score
    has significantly enhanced with the VGG19 and ResNet50 models. The recall parameter
    metric has also improved significantly with 91% for the ResNet50 deep vision model.
    And finally, the F1-score has also enhanced for the ResNet50 model with 87% score.
    Table 11 The results obtained from 3 different models using the CycleGAN leaf
    images. Full size table As noticed from the experimental results, the accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1-score have improved for all the deep vision models when
    adopting the CycleGAN leaf images. Figure 5 shows the classification accuracy
    for both the original DiaMOS dataset and the CycleGAN leaf images dataset. As
    presented below, the classification accuracy has improved for the three adopted
    models with an average of 7% enhancement. Figure 5 The accuracy score for the
    3 models using the two datasets. Full size image The precision score was measured
    in both scenarios for the three deep vision approaches, as noticed in Fig. 6.
    As presented below, there is a significant difference between the precision scores
    using the original dataset, and with using the CycleGAN leaf images dataset. An
    average enhancement in the precision score of 51% using the CycleGAN leaf images
    dataset in the three deep vision classification models. Figure 6 The precision
    score for the 3 models using the two datasets. Full size image The recall score
    on the other hand was also measured for the two systems using the three deep vision
    classification models. The recall score has noticeably enhanced when adopting
    the CycleGAN leaf images dataset. Figure 7 presents the recall score values for
    the two systems using the three deep vision classification models. As noticed,
    an average enhancement of 57% in the recall score value over the recall score
    that was obtained using the original dataset. Figure 7 The recall score for the
    3 models using the two datasets. Full size image Finally, the F1-score was measured
    for the two systems using the three different deep vision classification models.
    Figure 8 depicts the F1-scores for the three deep vision classification approaches
    using the original dataset and the CycleGAN leaf images dataset. As noticed the
    F1-score values have noticeably enhanced when the CycleGAN leaf images dataset
    was employed. An average enhancement of 48% when employing the CycleGAN leaf images
    dataset with the three deep vision classification models. Figure 8 The F1-score
    for the 3 models using the two datasets. Full size image Discussion In general,
    CNN architecture requires a large dataset for training purposes in order to achieve
    better classification performance, which is not valid in the area of plant disease
    classification. In addition, when the number of model parameters exceeds the number
    of data samples, the small training dataset causes overfitting, and hence minimize
    the classification accuracy32. Data augmentation can overcome the challenges of
    insufficient data and unequal distribution through increasing the model performance
    for several tasks, including: detection, classification and recognition of plant
    diseases. According to33, most of the recent developed machine learning approaches
    are based on the assumption that training sets have a well-balanced distribution,
    which is not exist in several case studies. Authors of34 proved that class imbalance
    has an impact on feed-forward neural network performance, particularly as the
    complexity of classes increases. Moreover, data augmentation has been employed
    in diverse deep learning applications due to its capability of creating new training
    data from the existing data. This is commonly achieved through applying annotation-preserving
    changes to the input data, such as: rotating, deforming, or translation of the
    image. Data augmentation can generate an infinite amount of training data. One
    of the efficient data augmentation approaches is the elastic deformation which
    has been effectively employed with CNN for medical image segmentation1. By overcoming
    the challenges of insufficient data and unequal distribution, data augmentation
    can increase model performance for tasks including classification, detection,
    and recognition of these diseases. Most learning algorithms are based on the assumption
    that training sets have a well-balanced distribution, which is not necessarily
    the case. The presented work in this paper has overcome the challenge of insufficient
    images to be involved in the training process. VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0
    have different classification performance when applied CycleGAN on the original
    data set, therefore the images generated by CycleGAN are quite similar to the
    original images, while CyleGAN based on random noise can generate various images.
    Furthermore, because healthy and curl were not even detected in the initial dataset,
    the overall classification accuracy for healthy and curl was higher than it had
    been previously. As a result, the experiment demonstrates that utilizing CycleGAN
    to produce plant leaf images to expand the dataset has practical utility since
    it can generate a variety of data, thereby resolving the issue of an unbalanced
    data set, and hence improving the classification accuracy for pear leaf disease
    classification. Conclusion and future work In the field of image generation, the
    CycleGAN architecture is commonly employed for diverse types of applications.
    However, most of the existing CycleGANs approaches were utilized to create images
    with sufficient data. The goal of this work was to build and employ the CycleGAN
    architecture for producing pear leaves in order to enlarge the data set and assess
    the usability of the generated leaves based on classification accuracy. In the
    selected dataset, the Curl and healthy leaves were unbalanced in the pear disease
    database. Therefore, we utilized the CycleGAN approach to generate 224 × 224 pixels
    leaf images through utilizing a minimal data source. After considering several
    experiments, the CycleGAN architecture has significantly enhanced the classification
    accuracy for the pear disease classification. In addition, the recall, precision,
    F1-score metrics have also been improved using the CycleGAN leaf dataset. For
    future works, we aim to investigate additional deep vision approaches for the
    purpose of improving the classification accuracy. Moreover, we aim to develop
    a reliable system using small-size processors (for instance: Raspberry Pi 4 or
    Jetson Nano) for the purpose of real-time plant disease classification. Plant

  description: Powered by data-driven technologies, precision agriculture offers immense
    productivity and sustainability benefits. However, fragmentation across farmlands
    necessitates distributed transparent automation. We developed an edge computing
    framework complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect
    various supply chain stages. Specifically, edge computing offers powerful capabilities

    We propose an edge computing framework tailored to agricultural needs to ensure
    sustainability through a renewable solar energy supply. Although the edge computing
    framework manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based
    mechanisms, such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making
    for smooth agricultural supply chain operations. We formulated invisible auction
    mechanisms that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined
    with machine learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. While rule-based
    fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, adaptable
    training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase
    hybrid learning approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated
    using domain expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets
    discover optimal crop demand–supply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems
    incorporate domain knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated
    evaluation of 50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance
    of the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model
    compared with benchmarks.

    help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase hybrid learning approach
    is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain expertise
    for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets discover optimal
    crop demand–supply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems incorporate domain
    knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated evaluation of
    50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance of the proposed
    edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model compared with
    benchmarks. Introduction Modern agriculture faces unprecedented stresses, such
    as rising food requirements from global population growth and declining arable
    land and water resources [1]. However, farm yields have plateaued, making bridging
    the supply–demand gap impossible. These macro trends necessitate urgent improvements
    in agricultural efficiency to boost productivity by up to 70% with shrinking buffers.
    Climate change pressures like extreme weather events, soil degradation, biodiversity
    losses, and rising carbon emissions threaten ecological sustainability. Agriculture
    accounts for over 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the sizable decarbonization
    potential. However, the sector needs to catch up to manufacturing and transport,
    among other sectors, in sustainability initiatives [2, 3]. Enhancing agriculture''s
    environmental footprint requires data-driven transparency in the operational decisions
    that guide targeted interventions [4]. At the execution level, the sector exhibits
    deeply fragmented value chains, with numerous small-hold farmers and intermediary
    aggregators connected to processors and distributors. The high variability and
    ambiguity in biological crop cultivation processes also introduce decision complexity
    for stakeholders. Managing the complexity of agricultural workflow is currently
    manual-intensive, opaque, and localized. These macro and micro challenges create
    a burning platform for transforming traditional agriculture through emerging technologies.
    The promise of precision agriculture powered by data-driven automation offers
    step-change boosts in productivity, quality, sustainability, and resilience [5,6,7,8].
    Recent advancements in sensors, communication networks, edge computing, blockchain,
    machine learning, and artificial intelligence can be harvested to uplift agriculture.
    However, myriad barriers to adoption persist, limiting the technology-upgrade
    cycles. Hyperlocalization, characterized by the high spatial variability of farm
    ecology, including factors such as soil nutrition, moisture patterns, and disease
    risks, requires hyperlocal insights [9]. Centralized systems must capture these
    microclimatic nuances. In addition, decision ambiguity arises from biological
    uncertainties, weather volatility, and market variability, thus introducing ambiguities
    that require more structured solutions. Rigid automation often leads to suboptimal
    results or overcorrections that require stability. Furthermore, ecosystem opacity
    within the fragmented, multi-stakeholder agricultural network contributes to the
    need for more transparency regarding peer practices, supply–demand patterns, and
    fair pricing, inducing informality. While data-driven precision agriculture promises
    potential benefits, farmer data privacy requires thoughtful consideration. For
    instance, privacy-aware schemes for point-of-interest recommendations that are
    also relevant in agriculture for sensitive farm-specific plans [10, 11]. Lastly,
    inadequate infrastructure, particularly in terms of telecom, power, and public
    cloud infrastructure, remains a significant challenge for large-scale smart upgrades,
    especially in emerging rural regions with connectivity gaps [12, 13]. Decentralized
    architectures have demonstrated their robustness in addressing infrastructure
    limitations. Smart agricultural systems apply modern information and communication
    technologies to enhance productivity, profitability, sustainability, and traceability
    across the agricultural value chain, including cultivation, postharvest handling
    and processing, logistics, and marketing [14]. Edge computing refers to the paradigm
    of decentralized data processing, whereby computation and analytics are embedded
    in the data source rather than relying on a distant, centralized cloud infrastructure.
    In agriculture, intelligent edge devices can be embedded in farm equipment, storage
    warehouses, processing plants, and retail outlets [15]. Key-edge computing capabilities
    include real-time insight generation, decision autonomy, data filtering, and operational
    visibility. The edge-processing topology also enhances scalability, reliability,
    and sustainability. Hosting decentralized intelligence close to dispersed agricultural
    endpoints facilitates hyperlocal and instantaneous data-to-decision, even in remote
    terrain. Auction markets refer to transparent bidding mechanisms that facilitate
    efficient price discovery and clearing of trade volumes between multiple buyers
    and sellers. Continuous double auctions allow participants to place ask or bid
    quotes that dynamically match compatible offers concurrently [16]. However, real-world
    bidder psychology requires governance to ensure stability. Computational techniques
    such as reinforcement learning can model optimized bidding tactics. Overall, auctions
    simplify bilateral negotiations and enable liquidity on a global scale. While
    neural networks offer adaptable nonlinear function approximations, fuzzy logic
    facilitates interpretable reasoning that supports agricultural decision-making.
    Fuzzy systems can also generate natural language advisories for irrigation, fertilization,
    harvest timing, etc., customized for highly divergent individual farm microclimates,
    soil health, and crop varieties. Unlike black-box methods, the ability to handle
    ambiguity and provide explanations builds trust [17]. Fuzziness reflects the underlying
    continuity of biological processes. While prior works have studied aspects of
    edge computing architectures, auction mechanisms, and fuzzy optimization models
    individually for agriculture, an integrated approach synergizing these promising
    directions still needs to be developed. Specifically, existing edge computing
    proposals need to tailor generic paradigms to address unique agriculture sector
    needs arising from operational scale, decision complexity, and value chain fragmentation.
    Similarly, agricultural auction designs focus on pricing efficiency rather than
    holistic supply chain coordination, covering planning, matching, and sustainability.
    Finally, fuzzy techniques largely encode scientific principles lacking adaptable
    learning for personalized needs spanning diverse regional and crop-specific considerations.
    Our unified edge computing, auction, and fuzzy neural network approach is uniquely
    positioned to overcome these limitations through a context-aware, transparent,
    and data-driven smart agriculture automation solution connecting the fragmented
    production-consumption lifecycle. The integrated architecture can capture localized
    variations, balance supply–demand stability, resolve decision uncertainty, and
    enable traceability for next-generation precision agriculture needs at a global
    scale. By combining the complementary strengths across emerging technologies,
    the transformation of agricultural supply chains toward data-driven precision
    approaches is accelerated, ushering in the future of farming. Accordingly, the
    main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We propose an edge computing
    framework tailored to agricultural requirements. The edge computing framework
    addresses several challenges by providing dense sensing coverage through various
    sensors, enabling preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities at the edge
    nodes, facilitating single-hop data transfer to cluster heads, implementing adaptive
    sensing to activate only the relevant nodes, and ensuring sustainability through
    a renewable solar energy supply. 2) We formulated invisible auction mechanisms
    that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined with machine
    learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. 3) Rule-based fuzzy systems
    encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, and adaptable training
    algorithms help optimize model parameters from data. A two-phase hybrid learning
    approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain
    expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. The remainder of this
    paper is organized as follows. Related work section  reviews related studies.
    Edge computing in agriculture section  introduces edge computing-oriented smart
    agriculture. The integration of auction mechanisms and fuzzy neural networks is
    discussed in Auction mechanism for agriculture section ,  Fuzzy and neural models
    section outlines the experiments conducted, and Edge computing-oriented smart
    agriculture section presents the conclusions. Related work Edge computing in agriculture
    Edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for addressing the challenges
    of data processing and decision-making in agriculture. By bringing computations
    closer to the data sources, edge computing enables the real-time processing and
    analysis of agricultural data, thereby reducing latency and improving responsiveness.
    Several studies have explored the applications of edge computing in agriculture,
    including precision agriculture, smart irrigation, and livestock monitoring [18,19,20].
    In [21], the authors introduced a two-tier genetic algorithm methodology aimed
    at optimizing a data analysis artificial intelligence system designed to monitor
    the conditions of agricultural vehicles. The cost-effective approach can be deployed
    on smartphones using integrated microphones rather than relying on expensive IoT
    sensors. By conducting an in-depth examination of the functioning of rural economies
    facilitated by the Internet, the authors thoroughly investigated the benefits
    of the Internet platform introduced in the operation of rural economies [22].
    Auction mechanisms for agriculture Auction mechanisms are widely used in agriculture
    to facilitate the trading of agricultural products. These mechanisms provide a
    decentralized and efficient way for farmers to sell their products and for buyers
    to obtain the desired products. Various agricultural auction mechanisms have been
    proposed, including open, sealed bid, and Dutch auctions [23]. To address the
    challenges related to low computational efficiency and restricted benefit distribution
    in the auction process, in [24], the authors introduced a novel deep learning-based
    iterative bilateral auction algorithm. This innovative approach represents an
    improvement over existing methods by harnessing deep learning capabilities to
    enhance the auction process. In [25], the authors evaluated the pricing efficiency
    of a livestock auction market using a two-tier stochastic frontier model. In [26],
    the authors devised a novel method to separate valuations from observed and unobserved
    variations using professional land appraisals. Fuzzy and neural models Fuzzy and
    neural models have been extensively employed in agriculture to model and predict
    complex systems. Fuzzy models can capture the uncertainty and imprecision inherent
    in agricultural data, whereas neural models can learn from the data and make accurate
    predictions. These models have been applied to various agricultural problems,
    such as crop yield prediction, disease detection, and pest management [27,28,29,30].
    Remya and Sasikala developed a neuro-fuzzy prediction model to simulate the behavior
    of international trade analysis in the agriculture industry [31]. Remya explored
    various neural network topologies and investigated methods for optimizing and
    analyzing these networks with agricultural data [27]. Ramana et al. used a convolutional
    neural network to classify and detect leaf disease [32]. Bhojani and Bhatt developed
    an amended multilayer perceptron neural network with a new activation function.
    They revised random weights and bias values for crop yield estimation using different
    weather parameter datasets [33]. Zhang et al. presented a radar echo prediction
    method representing disastrous weather based on convolutional neural networks
    and long short-term memory networks [34]. In summary, emerging computational paradigms
    demonstrate significant potential in helping realize the vision of smart agriculture
    but require synthesis considering problem constraints. Our work aims to address
    this research gap through an integrated edge intelligence, market coordination,
    and decision optimization approach purpose-built for the sector. Edge computing-oriented
    smart agriculture System model This study presents an edge computing framework
    complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect various supply
    chain stages, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overall framework Full size image Edge
    computing offers powerful capabilities that enable real-time monitoring and data-driven
    decision-making in smart agriculture. We propose an edge computing framework tailored
    to agricultural needs, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Proposed edge computing framework
    for smart agriculture Full size image The framework comprises three sections:
    the sensing layer, the edge computing layer, and the growth data model. Sensing
    layer The sensing layer consists of heterogeneous sensing devices deployed across
    agricultural fields to collect various crop and environmental parameters. Sensor
    nodes can be categorized as follows. Crop-monitoring nodes: Sense key parameters
    related to crop growth, health, and yield, including leaf area, canopy size, stem
    thickness, leaf color, crop height, and root size. Environmental monitoring nodes:
    Sense climatic parameters such as humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and soil
    nutrients. Sensor nodes include sensors, microcontrollers, wireless radios, power
    units, and other supporting circuits. Different wireless communication standards
    include WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and legacy protocols like Zigbee. LoRaWAN
    provides long-range connectivity that is particularly suitable for sparse farm
    deployment, whereas Wi-Fi and NB-IoT offer higher bandwidths [35]. Bluetooth is
    appropriate for short-range communications between proximal nodes. Let the heterogeneous
    sensor node set in the field be represented as follows: (1) where is the total
    number of deployed nodes, and we assume that each sensor node is aware of its
    location ( ) via either GPS or landmark-based localization. Nodes with overlapping
    sensing zones can collaborate to reduce redundancy. The sensor node set is divided
    into clusters based on the spatial proximity: (2) Clustering exploits locality
    to enable energy-efficient data routing. Each cluster has a cluster head elected
    dynamically that aggregates and relays data to the edge layer. Edge computing
    layer The edge computing layer comprises edge servers with significant computing
    power, storage, and analytics capabilities. We propose a heterogeneous edge computing
    architecture consisting of the following: Static edge nodes: Deployed at base
    stations in the field. Mobile edge nodes: Mounted on autonomous ground robots
    or UAVs. It provides blanket coverage through fixed nodes and targeted data collection
    through mobile nodes. The edge nodes are outfitted with solar panels, batteries,
    and wireless antennae to ensure sustainable off-grid operations. Key capabilities
    offered by the edge computing layer include (i) Cluster data aggregation: Combine
    sensor data from nodes within clusters; (ii) Preprocessing and storage: Filter
    noise, detect outliers and temporally store data; (iii) Growth stage identification:
    Classify current growth phase based on crop parameters; (iv) Analytics: Environmental
    and yield predictions via ML models; (v) Control policies: Adaptive sensing frequencies,
    irrigation levels etc. These edge-centric functions distribute computations closer
    to the sensors, avoid cluttering the cloud, and support real-time agriculture.
    Next, we formulated mathematical models for crop and environmental sensing data.  Growth
    data model We divide the crop lifecycle into phenological growth stages denoted
    by (3) The fuzzy cluster algorithm can determine from historical crop data. Let
    represent the crop parameter vector sensed across nodes at time ; denotes the
    th parameter, such as leaf area and plant height. We define a weighted crop indicator
    aggregating all parameters as follows: (4) where represents the relative importance
    of parameter . The growth stage at time can be estimated based on using a TSK
    fuzzy neural network. For example, if representing leaf area and plant height,
    and , then . 0.7 and 0.3 are the weights, while 0.6 and 0.8 are the parameter
    values. The weights scale the parameter values before summing. Edge computing
    framework Traditional wireless sensor network deployments for agricultural monitoring
    often suffer from several deficiencies, including manual measurements of parameters
    leading to sparse data, a lack of computational capabilities on nodes, long multi-hop
    routes causing delays and congestion, redundant sensing from overlapping nodes,
    and limited power availability restricting the system lifetime [36]. Collectively,
    these issues limit the efficiency and reliability of traditional WSNs in agricultural
    monitoring wireless sensor networks. Our proposed edge computing framework addresses
    several of these challenges by providing dense sensing coverage through a variety
    of sensors, enabling preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities at edge nodes,
    facilitating single-hop data transfer to cluster heads, implementing adaptive
    sensing to activate only relevant nodes, and ensuring sustainability through a
    renewable solar energy supply. This comprehensive approach aims to significantly
    enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of agriculture monitoring wireless sensor
    networks. Consequently, the framework can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal
    data to better capture crop dynamics. Furthermore, optimized sensing and computing
    policies reduce resource waste and data redundancy. For quantitative comparison,
    we evaluate key performance metrics in the experiment section. The decentralized
    architecture also enhances scalability for large farm acreages. Next, we detail
    the computational techniques implemented on the edge layer. The first functionality
    is accurately identifying phenological crop growth phases, allowing stage-specific
    sensing and interventions for precision agriculture. We formulate a fuzzy clustering
    approach using the Gath-Geva algorithm that minimizes within-cluster variance.
    Let historical crop data over time slots be represented as where is the parameter
    vector at slot . The crop cycle is divided into stages ( ) denoted by fuzzy partition
    matrix . Element defines the membership of slot in stage . The cluster centers
    are . We define classification coefficient and average fuzzy entropy as (5) The
    iterative fuzzy clustering algorithm tries to maximize and minimize . The steps
    are summarized as follows: Step 1. Initialize: Partition matrix , clusters , iterations
    , weight . Step 2. Compute cluster centers using membership . Step 3. Determine
    cluster covariance and prior probability. Step 4. Calculate fuzzy maximum likelihood
    distance measure. Step 5. Update partition matrix . Step 6. Repeat steps 2–5 until
    . Step 7. Choose optimal based on best and β . The defined method effectively
    divides the crop cycle into phenological growth phases, , matching the field duration.
    Next, we predicted the current stage based on the sensed indicators. To determine
    the growth phase, we designed a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy neural network model
    comprising five layers: input, fuzzification, rule, aggregation, and output. The
    first layer accepts an input vector containing current measurements of crop parameters.
    The fuzzification layer converts the inputs into a fuzzy set with Gaussian membership
    functions: (6) where and are the center and width of the th MF for th input, respectively.
    The first-order TS rule base comprises rules of the form (7) where is a consequent
    parameter. The net output is computed as where firing strength . For training,
    we used an extreme learning machine to randomly initialize the input layer weights
    and optimize the output layer weights analytically using the Moore–Penrose inverse.
    For sequential online adaptation, a recursive least-squares estimate was employed.
    The integrated TS fuzzy neural network model can accurately estimate crop growth
    stage at any instant based on the sensed crop indicators . Stage-specific control
    policies are then enacted. Next, we present the optimization of environmental
    sensing parameters. Correlations exist between external environmental factors
    and internal crop development processes. For example, high humidity and soil moisture
    are vital for plant emergence and flowering. However, continuously measuring all
    the parameters is energy-intensive. We propose an optimization technique driven
    by gray relational analysis to select the relevant attributes. Let represent the
    crop indicator sample sequence and denote the th environmental parameter sequence
    over slots. The gray relational coefficient between and is defined as follows:
    (8) where is the resolution coefficient. The degree of gray correlation (DGC)
    over all slots is (9) A higher DGC implies greater relevance of that attribute.
    However, crop indicators have different priority levels depending on their growth
    stage. Let represent the weight of indicator determined by the variance at each
    stage. The weighted correlation measure is (10) Gray relational analysis ranks
    all parameters in order of relevance to the current growth stage. The top-ranked
    attributes that satisfy the sensing time constraint are selected for measurement
    by the nodes. This method minimizes the infeasible measurements that are invalid
    for that phase. We designed an adaptive distributed sensing mechanism for crop
    growth data collection that activates relevant nodes based on spatial coverage
    constraints. Let represent a set of selected sensor nodes. The centroid of the
    active nodes is derived as follows: (11) The Euclidean distance of candidate sensor
    to centroid is (12) Node having maximum distance measure is incrementally added
    to if the effective coverage area meets the threshold where (13) This distributed
    algorithm allows only the appropriate sensors to be selected, thereby avoiding
    redundant measurements. The pseudocode is presented in Algorithm 1. Algorithm
    1. Adaptive crop growth sensor selection This method allows the activation of
    only a subset of nodes, thus saving energy and minimizing data redundancy. Subsequently,
    we evaluated the overall system performance against traditional approaches. Integration
    of auction mechanisms and fuzzy neural networks While the edge computing framework
    manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based mechanisms,
    such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making for smooth
    agricultural supply chain operations. Auction mechanisms for agricultural markets
    Auction mechanisms have become essential tools for achieving efficient price discovery
    and facilitating the exchange of goods between multiple buyers and sellers. They
    have gained significant prominence in commodity markets, particularly agriculture.
    These include automated matching, where continuous double auctions automatically
    pair compatible ask and bid orders, thereby saving manual effort and ensuring
    suitable trades; price discovery, as the ongoing interaction of agents leads to
    the emergence of market-clearing equilibrium prices that reflect fair valuation;
    allocation efficiency, where auction-clearing algorithms allocate goods to buyers
    willing to pay the highest price, promoting allocative efficiency; and transparency
    provided by centralized order books, offering insight into current prices and
    market depth, unlike in opaque bilateral negotiations. In addition, auctions offer
    anonymity to buyers and sellers, thereby reducing information leaks. At the same
    time, electronic trading significantly lowers the overhead transaction fees associated
    with intermediaries and paper-based processes, making auctions more cost-effective.
    Furthermore, the convenience of online accessibility ensures geography-independent,
    round-the-clock market access and liquidity. Although auctions possess characteristics
    that make them suitable for facilitating large-scale agricultural trade between
    numerous fragmented producers and consumers, several critical limitations must
    be addressed. First, information asymmetry between buyers and sellers stemming
    from differing private cost functions can enable fraudulent practices through
    unfair arbitrage. Additionally, the influence of visible market positions on expectations
    can result in frequent trading of speculative forward contracts that do not align
    with the underlying agricultural assets, potentially causing market distortions.
    Finally, agricultural markets are highly susceptible to external shocks, such
    as weather damage and policy changes, leading to volatile reactions that must
    be managed effectively to function as auctions in this context. To address these
    issues, we formulated invisible auction mechanisms that hide actual bid values
    and regulate information flows, combined with machine learning techniques for
    robust predictive analytics. We propose an invisible auction framework for agricultural
    commodity markets with the following components: Bid encryption: The participant
    bid values are encrypted using homomorphic public-key cryptography instead of
    visible quotes. (14) where is the actual valuation, is the public key, and is
    the published bid. Order matching: The auctioneer matches encrypted bids and asks
    by checking: (15) where denotes decryption via secret key . Transaction logging:
    An immutable distributed ledger chain transparently records all historically successful
    transactions with associated encrypted bid values. Predictive analytics: Long
    short-term memory neural networks are trained on aggregated transaction data flows
    to forecast future price dynamics and crop yields. This framework enhances transaction
    transparency without compromising privacy. Long-term trends can be forecasted
    through data analytics, whereas real-time irrational biases are moderated by cryptography.
    Violations, if any, get automatically flagged through audits promoting accountability.
    Therefore, an invisible auction architecture insulates agricultural markets from
    volatility and manipulation. Notably, invisible auctions preserve the desirable
    properties of traditional continuous double auctions, such as dynamic matching,
    efficient allocation, fairness, transparency, and anonymity. Only the price discovery
    process is indirectly influenced by analytics instead of directly visible bid-ask
    quotes. Regulatory oversight further nullifies the possibility of fraudulent behavior.
    This combination of cryptographic protection, machine intelligence, and accountable
    regulation stabilizes the agricultural commodity markets. Executing trade contracts
    through self-enforcing smart contracts over blockchain networks fosters seamless
    supply chain coordination. Smart contracts encode business rules governing supply
    chain interactions like procurement planning, financing payoffs, quality checks,
    and logistics flows. Input data are fed from trusted gateways, such as IoT sensors,
    with logic execution automatically managing the workflows. Integrated exception
    handling, such as penalties, improves accountability. Such blockchain-managed
    smart contracts promote coordination, transparency, and automation across agricultural
    value chain entities in a decentralized manner. The synthesis of auctions and
    distributed automation holistically connects disparate supply chain stages into
    a coherent system. Fuzzy neural network formulation Fuzzy logic and neural networks
    provide complementary modeling capabilities. While neural networks offer adaptable
    training for arbitrary complex mappings, fuzzy systems facilitate their interpretability.
    We formulate an integrated 5-layer architecture, as shown in Fig. 3, tailored
    to agricultural decision scenarios dealing with ambiguous and incomplete knowledge.
    Fig. 3 Fuzzy neural network schematic Full size image The input layer represents
    the problem domain parameters. For the agricultural application, input variables
    span crop attributes, weather forecasts, soil conditions, and market rates derived
    from field sensors, satellites, and domain expertise. Let vector denote the input
    variables. The normalization modules transform the features into comparable numerical
    ranges using min–max normalization. (16) This preprocessing enhances the training
    stability. The input layer feeds the normalized variables into the fuzzification
    layer for linguistic modeling. Membership functions convert real-valued inputs
    into fuzzy sets, mapping them to a normalized interval. Commonly adopted forms
    include triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian, and bell curves with tunable parameters.
    We utilize Gaussian membership functions for smoothness and concise representation
    as follows: (17) where is Gaussian center and denotes width. The membership functions
    transform agricultural inputs into overlapping fuzzy variables, such as LOW, MEDIUM,
    and HIGH temperature, and DRY, MODERATE, or WET soil moisture—granular discretization
    of the problem space results. The inference logic is encoded in the fuzzy rule
    base, aggregating input variable fuzzy sets to form output decisions. Popular
    compositional schemes include AND, OR, and NOT operators applied to antecedent
    clauses. We used conjunctive fuzzy rules, with each clause joined by an AND. (18)
    where denotes the fuzzy set of variable in rule and is the crisp rule output.
    For example, an example irrigation advisory rule may be (19) Domain experts formulate
    such fuzzy rules linking inputs to outputs using intuitive language. Automated
    methods also assist rulebase generation from data. The firing strength of the
    fuzzy rules indicates the degree of match with the inputs found by the fuzzy AND
    operator, which is typically implemented as (20) The firing strengths across the
    rule bases were aggregated using weighted average defuzzification for crisp decisions.
    (21) This generates robust aggregate outputs by combining recommendations from
    multiple rules applicable to the current agricultural situation. We applied a
    hybrid learning approach with gradient descent for parameter tuning from the data
    by adapting the output layer weights and the least mean square estimate to update
    the antecedent membership function parameters. Composite backpropagation regulates
    the model performance on yield prediction and disease diagnosis tasks while retaining
    transparency. The fuzzy neural network provides an accurate yet interpretable
    agricultural decision-making framework. Fuzzy model training algorithms While
    rule-based fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making,
    adaptable training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A
    two-phase hybrid learning approach is formulated. In the first phase, domain experts
    or clustering methods initialize the membership function parameters and rule bases.
    For example, the fuzzy variable MOISTURE can be defined as. (22) The membership
    functions translate the input moisture percentages into degrees of association
    with the fuzzified sets, LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Typical fuzzy rules then link
    the soil moisture status to irrigation amounts; for instance, (23) In the first
    phase, primitive fuzzy relationships are established between the inputs and outputs
    based on the principles of agricultural science. However, this initial model exhibits
    several drawbacks, including arbitrary membership function bounds, insufficient
    coverage of the rule base, inconsistent consequent actions, and a lack of consideration
    of relative rule importance. These limitations must be addressed to enhance the
    effectiveness and reliability of this model. Refining the primitive fuzzy system
    using data-driven adaptation alleviates these limitations and enhances performance.
    In the second phase, the model parameters were tuned based on streaming field
    observations of moisture levels, actual irrigation amounts, and crop yields. We
    formulated a two-step least-squares estimate (LSE) algorithm that minimizes the
    squared error loss between the fuzzy model outputs and the measured ground truth
    labels: (24) where represents fuzzy model output, is true label at time and denotes
    parameters. The hybrid LSE method decomposes into: (25) where maps inputs to rule
    firing levels dependent on antecedent parameters . The function aggregates rule
    outputs based on consequent weights . The two-step gradient descent iterate then
    becomes: (26) First, the membership function bounds were tuned to better match
    the field data associations. The second step rectifies the consequent actions,
    such as adjusting the irrigation amounts. Batch model retraining or sequential
    stochastic gradient descent helps automate the parameter learning. Therefore,
    the hybrid approach aligns the model variables and rules with the ground realities.
    For nondifferentiable aspects, evolutionary heuristics also assist in adaptation.
    The integrated data-driven training methodology optimizes fuzzy systems for reliable
    and context-aware agricultural decision-making support. Practical implementations
    have demonstrated order-of-magnitude improvements in prediction accuracy and rule-based
    optimization over nearly 3,000 crop cycles. The tailored fuzzy modeling paradigm
    offers transparent yet robust tools for precision agriculture. Fuzzy optimization
    of agricultural decisions Fuzzy systems offer efficient mechanisms for translating
    ambiguous input data into transparent agricultural decision-making policies. We
    use domain expertise to formulate fuzzy optimization models for three key supply
    chain decision problems. Precision agriculture requires the optimal dynamic allocation
    of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on crop stages,
    weather patterns, and soil conditions. We encode this as a multi-objective optimization
    problem. (27) The objectives are to maximize crop yield and minimize resource
    consumption costs and environmental impacts, subject to resource availability
    constraints. We designed a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system with a rulebase:
    (28) where linguistic variables, such as LOW and MEDIUM, model soil moisture and
    resource application levels, respectively. Defuzzification converts fuzzy outputs
    into actionable irrigation and fertilization rates [37, 38]. Common strategies
    include the centroid, mean-max, and maximum criteria. The weighted aggregate response
    resolves multi-objective optimization tradeoffs for personalized crop requirements.
    Agricultural scientists formulated approximate fuzzy relationships using field
    studies. Adaptive tuning then calibrates the recommendations to local conditions
    for precision farming. Crop planning involves annual decision-making regarding
    portfolio mixes across produce, acreage allocation, and planting schedules. The
    Mamdani fuzzy scheme for long-term planning is as follows: (29) Linguistic variables
    guide area expansion, reduction, or the status quo for different crops, contingent
    on historical profits and forecast outputs. Fuzzy crop planners offer interpretable
    data-to-decision modeling that complements predictive analytics. Tuning replenishment
    quantities and frequencies for seeds, fertilizers, equipment, etc. minimizes warehousing
    costs. The Mamdani fuzzy policy relating inventory levels to supply variability
    is [39]: (30) Strategic rules minimize stock-out risks and wastage induced by
    agricultural demand uncertainties for efficient operation. Fuzzy inventory controllers
    allow the embedding of domain insights and adaptive calibration. Integrated fuzzy
    optimization paradigms enable automated and interpretable agricultural decision-making
    by translating data into actions while balancing the supply chain KPIs. Extensions
    using neural learning and evolutionary heuristics can further enhance predictive
    accuracy and adaptation capabilities. Quantitative evaluation metrics Rigorously
    benchmarking the performance of fuzzy modeling and optimization methods requires
    quantitative accuracy metrics calculated from agricultural data. We utilized regression-based
    measures for prediction tasks and an economic cost–benefit analysis for the decision
    optimization results. Prediction problems in agriculture deal with forecasting
    time-varying phenomena such as crop yields, prices, and demand. The following
    accuracy measures were adopted: Mean absolute error (31) where is the actual observation
    and is the model-predicted value at time . Root mean-squared error (32) Mean absolute-percentage
    error (33) Coefficient of determination (34) Lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values,
    along with higher values, indicate superior predictive accuracy. Time-series metrics
    facilitate the comparison of performance improvements from fuzzy models over statistical
    baselines through field trials. For agricultural decision support scenarios, fuzzy
    systems optimize complex multidimensional objectives and balance relevant domain
    tradeoffs. Quantifying the realized business value requires a cost–benefit analysis.
    Net present value (35) where NPV calculates net economic gain over a lifetime,
    accounting for the time value of money. Return on investment (36) Payback period
    (37) These financial indicators estimate the sustainability of optimized fuzzy
    decision-making policies for precision agricultural management. Comprehensive
    evaluation is facilitated in conjunction with domain performance metrics such
    as crop quality and soil ecology. Fuzzy model interpretability Unlike black-box
    AI techniques, fuzzy systems enable the interpretation of knowledge encoded within
    models of transparency and trust. We analyzed rule-based insight extraction along
    three axes: Fuzzy rules employ natural language acting as intuitive decision policies:
    (38) The keywords HIGH and LOW map raw inputs into representative categories based
    on the underlying membership functions, allowing cognitive unpacking of the model
    logic linking various agricultural variables. Domain experts can validate whether
    the recommendations match the expected crop patterns in that context. This contrasts
    with the inscrutable weights in deep neural networks. Furthermore, the fuzzy model
    adapts its linguistic knowledge bank when novel unseen data patterns emerge and
    updates the rules with new terms. Variable relevance heat maps help identify key
    agricultural drivers based on the frequency of appearance in the fuzzy rule antecedents.
    (39) Higher weight parameters were prioritized for data collection using appropriate
    field sensors. The domain significance was also uncovered, such as the dominant
    weather influence on soil nutrition. Heatmaps improve model transparency in a
    manner similar to a sensitivity analysis. The firing strength of the fuzzy rules
    on the new data samples indicates the usage frequency, allowing the calculation
    of the rule influence: (40) where is the number of rules, and rules with higher
    influence drive aggregated model decisions more critically and distinguish between
    redundant niche policies. Such analysis enhances user trust and model debugging.
    The integrated interpretation toolkit, consisting of intuitive fuzzy rules, diagnostic
    heatmaps, and influence metrics, boosts model transparency, which is crucial for
    credibility and adoption—the agriculture-specific explanations bridge skill gaps
    preventing black-box automation. Experiment and results analysis Results under
    edge computing-oriented smart agriculture We evaluated the edge-based smart agriculture
    framework on 50 prototype farms and compared the performance with that of traditional
    sensing architectures. The key metrics analyzed were the crop cycle duration error,
    growth stage prediction accuracy, energy consumption, and sensed data redundancy.
    The farms spanned a geographical area of 250 acres and was divided into 100 sensing
    cells with a cluster of 20 sensor nodes randomly distributed per cell. The nodes
    possessed temperature, humidity, CO2, and lighting sensors with LoRa communication
    links. A solar-powered edge server was present in each cell, with a computing
    capacity of 2 GHz clock and 8 GB of RAM. The edge nodes also had a cellular 4G
    hookup for cloud analytics. The key capabilities deployed were fuzzy growth phase
    classification, adaptive neural growth forecasting, gray relational parameter
    selection, and distributed cell selection policies. Specifically, time-series
    data collected from 50 farms over five crop cycles of 90 days each, totaling over
    22,500 h of data, has the characteristics: multivariate data encompassing crop
    yields, market auction prices, soil moisture content, temperature, humidity, nutrition,
    and rainfall. The data was aggregated from IoT sensors like soil probes and weather
    stations deployed across the 50 farms to measure crop and environment conditions
    online agriculture commodity trading platforms recording market prices. These
    edge intelligence modules guide dynamic sensor scheduling and data routing, subject
    to lifetime and coverage constraints. The integrated edge-fog cloud architecture
    provides flexibility to distribute analytics across devices, cells, and the global
    scope [40]. We cultivated cabbage over three 90-day crop cycles, with sensor measurements
    gathered at hourly intervals. Table 1 compares the performance of our edge computing
    framework with that of conventional cloud-based sensor networks in terms of key
    metrics. Table 1 System deployment results Full size table It can be observed
    that the integrated edge computing architecture demonstrates superior crop modeling
    capabilities with halved season estimation errors and 23% improved classification
    accuracy over legacy networks. Strategic sensor-scheduling policies based on growth
    phases minimize redundant data collection and overlaps. Furthermore, analytics
    co-location with data sources avoids expensive cloud transmissions and reduces
    energy requirements by over 20%. Streamlined data pipelines facilitate deeper
    field insights into the exact operational costs. Next, we analyze the detailed
    sensitivity toward the prediction and selectivity mechanisms underlying these
    agriculture 4.0 productivity gains. The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2
    Cabbage growth phase accuracy Full size table Fuzziness captures intermediately
    transitioning states better than rigid discrete models. Furthermore, Table 3 shows
    that the classification approach is computationally efficient, requiring only
    14 mJ of energy and delivering 77% of the lifetime gains. Hence, edge computing
    enables advanced analytics by using frugal models on tight mobile platforms. Table
    3 Energy consumption comparison Full size table The context-aware parameter selection
    scheme dynamically detects relevant attributes over the cabbage crop cycle using
    gray relational analysis, with the Pearson coefficient as a similarity metric.
    Table 4 shows the nutrient requirements, which varied across the seeding, vegetation,
    and pre-maturity stages. Our model automatically activated the corresponding sensors,
    MOISTURE during growth and NPK during flowering. Table 4 Representative parameters
    across cabbage phenology Full size table Such automated tuning of pertinent factors
    enhances efficiency; on average, only 21% of the available sensors are triggered
    per phase. Domain knowledge fusion achieves sparsity without compromising coverage.
    Edge analytics extract contextual execution policies that are challenging to infer
    as centralized. The decentralized sensor coordination protocol dynamically partitions
    cells into active sensing zones and candidate regions iteratively minimizing the
    (41) The distance metric ensures that dispersed sensors are selected, thereby
    capturing wider samples. Furthermore, the effective coverage area is (42) Thresholds
    prevent overlap. Unlike centralized controllers, distributed policies respond
    faster to local moisture fluctuations. Table 5 shows evidence that decentralized
    coordination minimizes the number of active nodes and saves intranet routing overhead
    for fog computing gains. Table 5 Distributed optimization savings Full size table
    The integrated edge intelligence pillars achieved significant analytical enhancements
    while minimizing costs and demonstrating system-wide data-to-decision transformations.
    Field trials have validated that technology synergies unlock considerable efficiencies.
    In addition to productivity, environmental sustainability is enhanced through
    optimized resource usage. Evaluation under integration of auction mechanisms and
    fuzzy neural networks We evaluated the performance of the developed agricultural
    supply chain architecture by integrating edge computing, auction markets, and
    fuzzy optimization models across multiple metrics: crop price and yield forecasting
    accuracy, supply chain cost reduction, carbon footprint minimization, revenue
    and profit enhancements, and operational efficiency improvements. The field trial
    involved a consortium of 50 farmers producing corn and wheat varieties and selling
    them to 75 consumers via online auction platforms throughout five crop cycles.
    Transaction data flowed into analytical models that predicted seasonal averages
    for crop prices, production yields, and demand levels. These are fed into planning
    modules that encode domain constraints and business rules to issue quantity and
    portfolio recommendations in response to emerging dynamics. For prediction accuracy,
    the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network (EC-aFNN)
    should be compared with the four benchmarks: (i) BMAE-Net [41]: data-driven weather
    prediction network, (ii) Bayesian neural network (BNN) [42]: corn yield prediction
    based on remotely sensed variables, (iii) random forest regression (RFR) [43]:
    yield and quality prediction of winter rapeseed (iv) dingo-optimized sand piper
    (DOSP) [44]: automatic crop yield prediction framework designed with two-stage
    classifiers, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Forecasting performance comparison Full
    size image Superior accuracy metrics directly and positively affect various aspects
    of smart agricultural supply chain operations. Enhanced crop planning enabled
    by more precise yield and price forecasting allows farmers to develop data-driven
    sowing plans for the next season by considering soil conditions, water availability,
    and risk reduction. This accuracy also supports effective procurement optimization
    as it helps suppliers adjust inventories through calibrated stochastic ordering
    policies, thus minimizing waste. Additionally, efficient logistics coordination
    becomes possible by zonally matching the expected supply and consumption through
    granular forecasts, thereby facilitating right-sized transportation planning.
    Moreover, the stability of market dynamics improved significantly. The deep visibility
    of long-term trends through fuzzy models moderates speculative volatility and
    reduces irrational panic buying and selling. Furthermore, personalized recommendations
    can be tailored to individual farms based on hyperlocal crop-choice suggestions
    and cultivation advisories derived from precise geospatial predictions. Automation
    plays a crucial role, with smart contracts encoding decision rules around procurement
    quantities, shipping sizes, etc. These contracts automatically execute transfers
    based on reliable forecasts. In summary, integrated edge computing, auction markets,
    and fuzzy neural network architectures deliver accuracy improvements that drive
    data-driven, transparent automation, harmonize supply and demand, and lead to
    quantifiable enhancements in sustainability, profitability, and resilience throughout
    the agricultural value chain. Optimized production and delivery coordination minimizes
    waste across agricultural value chain stages, as shown in Fig. 5. Total food loss
    was reduced by 29%, thus lowering operational costs. Fig. 5 Food wastage reduction
    across supply chain Full size image Across all stages, the EC-aFNN architecture
    provides superior food waste reduction compared with state-of-the-art benchmark
    food supply chain models, leading to enhanced sustainability. Supply chain transparency
    and coordination eliminate excess resource usage, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Agricultural
    sustainability enhancements Full size image It can be observed that the integrated
    edge computing, auction markets, and fuzzy optimization framework provide 31–55%
    superior sustainability improvements along with energy, water, fertilizer, and
    pesticide reduction over the BNN, which highlights the strengths of our approach.
    Transparent price discovery boosted per-acre incomes for individual farmers, as
    shown in Fig. 7. Speculation risks declined through auction regulations, enhancing
    stability. Fig. 7 Increase in farmer profits per acre of land Full size image
    It can be observed that EC-aFNN architecture provides 37% superior profitability
    improvements per acre over the best benchmark BNN. Enhanced forecasting accuracy
    directly boosted incomes by eliminating wastage. The integrated edge computing,
    auction markets, and fuzzy optimization framework deliver accuracy improvements
    that drive data-driven, transparent automation, harmonize supply and demand, and,
    in turn, lead to quantifiable enhancements in sustainability, profitability, and
    resilience throughout the agricultural value chain. This study attributes the
    per-acre profitability gains to a combination of factors. These include enhanced
    price discovery and stability via auction market regulations, which, coupled with
    improved forecasting accuracy that reduced waste, led to increased incomes. Additionally,
    the data-driven and transparent automation enabled by the integrated framework
    played a crucial role in these gains. Moreover, the synergistic fusion of edge
    computing, auctions, and fuzzy techniques contributed significantly to the overall
    improvements in profitability. Figure 8 shows the improvements in operational
    key performance metrics. Fig. 8 Improvements in operational key performance metrics
    Full size image It can be observed that the integrated EC-aFNN architecture provides
    up to 43% superior improvements in asset utilization and service levels compared
    to the best benchmark model, BNN. Transparent information exchange and collaborative
    planning enabled right-sizing capacities to balance demand fluctuations. Therefore,
    the integrated architecture realizes quantifiable enhancements across key supply
    chain indices. A detailed comparative analysis substantiates the synergistic fusion
    of emerging technologies that transform traditional fragmented agriculture through
    informed automation. Conclusion Precision agriculture promises immense benefits
    but is hindered by fragmentation, opacity, and decision complexity. In this study,
    an integrated edge computing, auction, and fuzzy optimization approach was developed
    to address these barriers. The decentralized edge paradigm hosts localized crop
    analytics and provides real-time advisories. Apart from transparent price signals,
    auction mechanisms balance supply and demand. Fuzzy techniques allow domain knowledge
    to be encoded into interpretable crop-recommendation models. The integrated evaluation
    of a 50-farm consortium substantiates its outperformance over conventional approaches:
    31% supply chain cost reduction through lowered waste, 37% per acre profit increase
    via auction efficiency, 55% carbon emissions decrease using sustainability analytics,
    and 43% raised asset utilization from the sharing economy. A streamlined data-to-action
    architecture provides a robust, transparent, and efficient solution tailored to
    diverse agricultural requirements. While the integrated edge computing and auction-based
    fuzzy agriculture framework provide significant enhancements, certain limitations
    must be addressed in the future. Microclimate spatial variability, even within
    farms, necessitates adaptable recommendations by incorporating aerial/satellite
    imagery analysis to achieve localized precision. Additionally, resilience to unexpected
    severe weather events via climate ensemble simulations will make the system robust
    despite disruptions to harvest cycles. Simultaneously, expansions can enrich structured
    knowledge through formal agriculture ontology and semantics, elucidating soil,
    climate, and crop interrelationships. Optimized water conservation based on moisture
    patterns, supplemental controlled irrigation, and permissible stress thresholds
    present another sustainment opportunity. Furthermore, significant renewable energy
    potential exists at farms for solar, wind, and biofuels to attain carbon–neutral
    operations. Incorporating these limitations and proposed future enhancements centered
    on robust, adaptable models, geospatial intelligence, sustainability, and structured
    decision formalization will accentuate practical impact while opening longer-term
    possibilities. Availability of data and materials No datasets were generated or

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;
    Positives / (True\\; Positives + False\\; Positives)$$ (15) $$Recall = True\\;
    Positives / (True \\;Positives + False \\;Negatives)$$ (16) $$F1 \\;Score = 2
    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    and AI summarized. Introduction Incorporation of fruits and vegetables into our
    daily diet is essential for overall health, providing vital nutrients and contributing
    to disease prevention (Slavin et al. 2012). However, sourcing high-quality produce
    can be challenging, and ensuring timely delivery to consumers is crucial (Tata
    et al. 2022). The etymology of \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" adds an interesting
    twist to our understanding of these dietary components, with Latin roots suggesting
    concepts of enjoyment, growth, and flourishing (Vidal et al. 2013; Vijayakumar
    and Vinothkanna 2020). These natural health capsules are rich in carbohydrates,
    minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibers, playing a role in the prevention of various
    diseases like cardiovascular conditions and cancer. Scientific studies consistently
    highlight the connection between their consumption and reduced chronic diseases
    (Magwaza et al. 2015). Nevertheless, assessing the maturity of fruits and vegetables
    accurately has been a traditional, manual, and labor-intensive process, often
    reliant on subjective judgments by experienced personnel (Prasad et al. 2018).
    Compared to traditional methods of maturity index determination for fruits and
    vegetables, the integration of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques represents
    a significant advancement. Traditional approaches often rely on manual and labor-intensive
    assessments, which are inherently subjective and time-consuming. These methods
    are prone to errors, lack consistency across different evaluations, and can result
    in delays in the supply chain. Moreover, destructive techniques used in traditional
    assessments involve disintegrating the produce, leading to product loss and waste
    (Vyawahare et al. 2013; Karunathilake et al. 2023). The recent advancement in
    the field of computer vision has revolutionized various industries, with agriculture
    benefiting significantly from computer vision applications. The evaluation of
    maturity is a crucial step in the supply chain, impacting quality, taste, and
    marketability (Naik et al. 2017). While traditional methods have been somewhat
    effective, they are prone to errors, time-consuming, and lack consistency across
    different evaluations. Moreover, destructive techniques used in traditional assessments,
    such as disintegrating the produce, lead to product loss and waste (Gupta et al.
    2022a). To overcome these challenges, researchers and technologists have turned
    to state-of-the-art computer vision approaches, leveraging image processing, sensor-based
    solutions, and artificial intelligence (AI) models to automate and optimize the
    maturity assessment process (Xiao et al. 2023; Dhanya et al. 2022; Cárdenas-Pérez
    et al. 2017 ). AI models play a pivotal role in grading produce based on factors
    like size, shape, and color, significantly influencing market acceptability. These
    models, trained on extensive datasets, excel at accurately categorizing fruits
    and vegetables, offering scalability and adaptability (Xiao et al. 2023). Pre-processing
    methods, including data augmentation, normalization, Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), further enhance accuracy and efficiency.
    Mobile applications powered by AI and neural networks have made it user-friendly,
    allowing consumers to snap a picture and receive instant quality feedback (Naranjo-Torres
    et al. 2020). Moreover, sensor-based techniques, utilizing emitted gases to determine
    maturity index, offer non-invasive and real-time insights into physiological changes,
    aiding timely harvesting and supply chain management. These advancements encompass
    both destructive techniques, involving high-performance chromatography methods,
    and non-destructive methods like Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic
    Resonance (NMR), and Raman Spectroscopy-imaging, providing rapid and efficient
    evaluation while minimizing waste (Gupta et al. 2022a). As global populations
    grow and resources dwindle, the integration of computer vision in agriculture
    becomes imperative for sustainable practices. Combined with precision agriculture,
    computer vision optimizes the entire supply chain while reducing environmental
    impact. Compared to traditional methods of maturity index determination, computer
    vision techniques offer greater accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making
    them a transformative solution in the field of maturity assessment for fruits
    and vegetables. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
    principles, applications, and future directions of computer vision in this field,
    contributing to the advancement of sustainable and efficient agricultural practices
    worldwide. Collection of literature data To collect data, we conducted a systematic
    review using the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. Initially, we employed various
    keywords, resulting in varying paper counts for different search queries. Specifically,
    we identified 192 papers related to \"Fruits and vegetables + Biosensors,\" 114
    papers for \"Fruits and vegetables + Maturity Index,\" 4 papers for \"Fruits and
    vegetables + Biosensors + Machine Learning,\" 342 papers for \"Fruits and vegetables + Machine

    In addition, Google Scholar yielded 329 papers for “fruits and vegetable” AND
    “maturity detection,” 9 papers for \"Fruits and vegetables\" AND \"maturity detection\"
    AND \"Biosensor,\" 194 papers for \"Fruits and vegetables\" AND \"maturity detection\"
    AND \"Machine learning,\" and 105 papers for \"Fruits and vegetables\" AND \"maturity

    process, please see to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Study selection for review (PRISMA criteria
    described in Moher et al. 2014) Full size image Maturity indices of fruits and
    vegetables Maturity refers to the stage of development when produce has completed
    its natural growth and is ready for harvest, facilitating proper ripening. However,
    horticultural maturation is determined based on utilization purposes. Specific
    maturity indices must be developed for each commodity due to significant variations.
    Harvesting fruits at an immature stage often leads to their inability to ripen,
    resulting in a firm texture, low flavors, and susceptibility to internal breakdown
    and wooliness during extended cold storage (Doerflinger et al. 2015). Maturity
    indices play a crucial role in determining the ideal harvest time, providing marketing
    flexibility, and ensuring acceptable eating quality for consumers. These indices
    consider factors such as chronological age, size, shape, surface characteristics,
    color, firmness, soluble solids, abscission layer development, surface morphology,
    tenderness, sugar and starch presence, sweetness index (sugar-to-acid ratio),
    and oil content. Fruits and vegetables are classified into physiological maturity
    when development reaches a sufficient stage while attached to the plant, and horticultural/commercial
    maturity when they exhibit desired characteristics for consumers (Arefi et al.
    2015; Kang et al. 2008; Khaled et al. 2015). The stages of development, ripening,
    maturation, and deterioration are predictable for most horticultural food products,
    varying from early harvest for certain crops like sprouts and salad crops, to
    late harvest for seeds or nut crops based on consumer preference (Kurita et al.
    2006; Kyriacou and Rouphael 2018; Mehinagic et al. 2004). Detailed information
    on the maturity indices and determination methods for selected fruits and vegetables
    is provided in Table 1. Table 1 Maturity indices of selected fruits and vegetables
    and their methods to determine (Prasad et al. 2018) Full size table Methods of
    maturity determination Destructive methods Measurements of physical, chemical,
    and sensory properties of texture and their relationships are essential. A sensory
    test is a method through which the qualities of agricultural yields are evaluated
    based on the senses of touch, smell, taste, sight, or hearing. Individuals are
    well-prepared for this task, scoring the instances based on specified properties.
    Furthermore, sensory tests can be complemented by physical and chemical measurements
    (Gupta et al. 2022b). Synopses of these techniques applied to mealiness identification
    in potatoes and apples follow below: Various tests, including puncture, twist,
    tensile, and Kramer shear tests, as well as recording of chewing sounds, can be
    conducted to elucidate the textural attributes of apples, as assessed by a taste
    panel. The puncture test has been identified as the most effective method for
    describing crispness, crunchiness, hardness, juiciness, ease of disintegration,
    and mealiness (Pereira et al. 2018; Surya Prabha and Satheesh Kumar 2015). As
    mentioned earlier, the level of juiciness and softness in apples is also related
    to mealiness. Crispiness can serve as a good indicator of softness. Several other
    methods have been employed to assess the crispiness of apples by analyzing chewing
    sounds. This involves investigating the relationship by recording the chewing
    sounds with a microphone placed near the mouth and utilizing Fourier transformation
    to record signals. However, this test may not yield highly significant results,
    as chewing speed and techniques vary among individuals (Kurita et al. 2006; Kyriacou
    and Rouphael 2018; Mehinagic et al. 2004). In recent years, chewing has been replaced
    by invented devices. In this method, acoustic systems have been integrated into
    the standard measurement tools for assessing the mechanical characteristics of
    tissues. Consequently, a microphone can record the sound produced during mechanical
    tests, such as penetration tests. Hence, it can be concluded that the compression
    test is preferable for identifying mealy apples because it simultaneously measures
    free juiciness and flesh stiffness (Vidal et al. 2013; Vijayakumar and Vinothkanna
    2020). Raman spectroscopy can be employed to detect changes in the amount of tannin
    in pomegranate fruits as they mature. Tannins are a class of polyphenolic biomolecules
    with astringent properties, capable of binding and precipitating proteins, as
    well as other organic components like amino acids and alkaloids. They are present
    in both fruits and vegetables (Vargas-Murga et al. 2016), and their significant
    health benefits have garnered increased interest. Tannins are chromoplasts, which
    are fat-soluble microconstituents with crucial functions, antioxidant properties,
    and physiological effects (Both et al. 2018). Pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum
    L.) is among the most productive fruits, primarily found in tropical and subtropical
    regions, including India, Iran, Afghanistan, as well as Mediterranean countries
    like Morocco, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern countries
    (Khodabakhshian and Emadi 2016). It contains high concentrations of tannins, carotenoids,
    phenolics, flavonoid glycosides, flavones, flavonols, and flavoxanthin (Hmid et
    al. 2017). Furthermore, the concentration of these phytochemicals changes as the
    fruit matures. Pomegranate fruit has an astringent flavor in its early stages
    of development, closely linked to increasing tannin content as the fruit ripens.
    Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective and efficient methods for determining
    the optimal harvesting period for pomegranate fruit to ensure the highest quality
    accepted by consumers. While visible spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid
    chromatography (HPLC) have been the standard techniques for determining tannin
    presence in recent years, numerous novel and suitable analytical methods are being
    introduced. Raman spectroscopy is one such method, providing quick and in-situ
    analysis, offering information on chemical and structural molecules, and enabling
    multiple analyses with minimal sample preparation (Boyaci et al. 2015). The International
    Pharmacopoeia and Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methodologies
    were employed with minor modifications to analyze tannin concentration in pomegranates.
    In FT-Raman spectroscopy, cross-sections of cut pomegranates undergo analysis
    within a specific spectral range spanning from 100 to 3000 cm−1. This analysis
    involves the use of a Bruker FRA106 Raman module and Opus 5.5 acquisition software,
    with laser excitation at 1064 nm. The laser spot employed during the examination
    is approximately 100 μm in size, and the power of the laser applied to the pomegranate
    samples is set at approximately 100 mW. To ensure accurate and reliable data,
    the experiment involves obtaining 1000 scans, each with a spectral resolution
    of 4 cm−1. This is achieved using a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS 870 spectrometer, manufactured
    by Thermo Electron Corp, based in Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A. By utilizing this
    specialized instrumentation and precise parameters, researchers can extract valuable
    information regarding the molecular composition and characteristics of pomegranates,
    contributing to a deeper understanding of their properties and potential applications.
    Non- destructive methods The raising awareness of consumers in high quality of
    foods directs the producers to a reliable, rapid, nondestructive, and noninvasive
    technique for maturity determination, especially during harvesting and packaging
    processes. Therefore, in recent years, the application of nondestructive, noninvasive,
    and noncontact methods and designing new instruments for food quality determination
    have been the focus of interest by researchers (Yahaya et al. 2014; Yang et al.
    2021). These techniques are becoming more favored and practical compared to destructive
    techniques as nondestructive methods allow the measurement and analysis of individual
    fruit, reduce waste, and permit repeated measurements on the same item (Arendse
    et al. 2018). Different quality parameters have been determined in several agricultural
    products by a variety of nondestructive methods. These methods are based on optical,
    mechanical, electrical, and electromagneticmeasurements (Pourkhak et al. 2017;
    Mireei et al. 2015). Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) (Suchanek et al.
    2017; Zhang et al. 2012), Raman imaging (Munera et al . 2017), ultraviolet (UV),
    NIR, mid-infrared (MIR), electronic nose (e-nose) (Srivastava and Sadistap 2018),
    ultrasonic technique (Ikeda et al. 2015), and machine vision (Hitchman et al.
    2016) are some widely used nondestructive methods. Non-destructive fruit ripeness
    assessment offers numerous advantages over conventional destructive procedures,
    including high throughput evaluation, concurrent multiple measurements, and real-time
    decision-making capabilities. As fruits ripen, they undergo complex phenotypic
    changes, transitioning from green, hard, and immature to more colorful, softer,
    sweeter, and aromatic states (Uluışık et al. 2018). Destructive measures, due
    to the large number of samples needed, are time-consuming and cannot simultaneously
    evaluate all quality parameters in the field. Consequently, the need for simple
    and representative non-destructive measurements arises to determine fruit ripeness
    effectively (Vanoli et al. 2020). In this context, several works examine modeling
    techniques for predicting the ideal harvest time and non-destructive methods for
    assessing fruit freshness (Zaborowicz et al. 2017). These predictions are based
    on spectroscopic and/or imaging methods that quantify the color and/or spectral
    characteristics of fruits, reflecting changes in their molecular makeup during
    ripening. The functions and applications of non-destructive method techniques
    are discussed in Table 2, providing a comprehensive understanding of the strengths
    and limitations of both destructive and non-destructive approaches. By critically
    examining the latest research and technological advancements in this field, we
    aimed to contribute to the ongoing development and implementation of innovative
    practices in the fruit industry. Table 2 Non-destructive methods to determine
    quality characteristics of fruits and vegetables (Zhang et al. 2014; Dhiedt et
    al. 2021; Gupta et al. 2022a) Full size table Visible / Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    (NIRS) NIRS is founded on the fundamental principles of spectral absorption and
    reflection, where near-infrared light interacts with the chemical composition
    of fruits. This interaction is governed by the vibrations of chemical bonds in
    organic molecules, with each compound exhibiting characteristic absorption bands
    in the NIR spectrum. The heart of NIRS lies in its calibration models, constructed
    through the relationship between known chemical compositions and measured spectral
    data during a training process. The electromagnetic spectrum''s range from 780
    to 2500 nm is covered by NIRS (Gupta et al. 2022a). Utilizing mathematical algorithms,
    NIRS quantitatively analyzes fruit samples, providing rapid and non-destructive
    estimations of critical parameters like sugar content and moisture levels. This
    non-invasive nature of NIRS, coupled with its ability to reveal the chemical makeup
    of fruits, makes it an invaluable tool in fruit maturity estimation, ensuring
    the quality and integrity of fruit produce while supporting efficient agricultural
    and food industry practices (Pandiselvam et al. 2022). NIRS finds wide-ranging
    applications in the realm of maturity determination due to its non-destructive
    and rapid analytical capabilities. One primary application lies in the assessment
    of fruit ripeness. NIRS can accurately determine key indicators of maturity, such
    as sugar content, acidity, and moisture levels, without the need for invasive
    sampling. This information is invaluable for growers and producers as it helps
    them determine the optimal harvest time, ensuring fruits reach their peak flavor
    and nutritional value. Moreover, NIRS is instrumental in quality control during
    post-harvest handling and processing. It enables the quick sorting and grading
    of fruits based on their maturity, allowing for the segregation of ripe fruits
    from those that need more time to ripen. This not only reduces food waste but
    also enhances the efficiency of supply chains. Additionally, NIRS facilitates
    the monitoring of fruit quality during storage and transportation, helping to
    prevent spoilage and maintain product integrity. In sum, the application of NIRS
    in maturity determination empowers the agricultural and food industries to make
    informed decisions that improve both product quality and overall operational efficiency
    (Pandiselvam et al. 2022). It helps in fruit sorting and grading and is more suited
    to practical application. This technique measures the skin tone of fruits like
    bananas, apples, tomatoes, and mangoes to assess fruit maturity (Fig. 2). The
    skin colour is influenced by how much chlorophyll is found there. The changes
    in pigmentation can be used to gauge the maturity of fruits. As the fruit ripens
    the chlorophyll content starts decreasing (Chauhan et al. 2017). Ravindran et
    al. (2015) had used NIR approach to test fruit firmness and find output whether
    if there are any obvious flaws. Using this method, it is possible to test soluble
    solid content, dry matter, hygroscopicity, hardness, sugar content, acidity, etc.
    without the need for any special equipment. Fig. 2 Measurement of plum fruit quality
    using VIS/NIR  (Source: Posom 2020) Full size image Lan et al. (2020) conducted
    a study on apple quality, utilizing spectral details to predict various parameters,
    including viscosity, cell wall content, dry matter, soluble solids content (SSC),
    and puree product titratable acidity (TA) (Lan et al. 2020). The spectral measurements
    encompassed a range of 800–2,500 nm and employed an automatic sampling wheel with
    18 different positions. However, it was noted that methods utilizing six optical
    fibers or manual positioning appeared to be more realistic and accurate, possibly
    due to the consistency of the sampling wheel setup. Notably, SSC determination
    yielded a high R2 value of 0.92, underscoring the method''s effectiveness in assessing
    puree product homogeneity (Lan et al. 2020). Further investigations into NIRS
    applications revealed its efficacy in predicting parameters like soluble solids,
    glucose, malic acid, and dry matter in calçot onions and apple purees (Lan et
    al. 2021; Sans et al. 2018). These studies highlighted the successful use of spectral
    analysis for quality evaluation of purees. Khodabakhshian et al. extended NIRS
    analysis to pomegranates, employing both transmittance and reflectance modes in
    the 400–1,100 nm range, and employed pretreatments such as standard normal variate
    (SNV) and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) to account for morphological
    variations in pomegranate varieties (Khodabakhshian et al. 2019). Hu et al. (2019)
    conducted an extensive study on SSC determination in Hami melons, exploring various
    measuring configurations, variable selection algorithms, and classification models.
    The calyx model emerged as the most effective, likely due to higher SSC content
    in the calyx region. This underscores the importance of precise measurement location
    for accurate predictions. A similar study on apples incorporated multiple orientations,
    with the stem-calyx vertical orientation with the stem upward proving optimal
    (Xia et al. 2019). Various combinations of variable selections and prediction
    algorithms indicated that the Monte Carlo–uninformative variable elimination–successive
    projections algorithm (MC-UVE-SPA) achieved the best results for SSC determination
    (Rp > 0.8) (Hu et al. 2019). Xia et al. (2019) found that competitive adaptive
    reweighted sampling-subwindow permutation analysis-partial least square (CARS-SPA-PLS)
    performed well for SSC prediction in apples, with a low root mean square error
    of prediction (RMSEP) of < 0.573° brix. They also emphasized the importance of
    determining effective wavelengths from a global model to mitigate orientation
    effects. Texture assessment, a critical factor in evaluating agricultural product
    quality, involves parameters like firmness and penetrometer readings (Camps and
    Gilli 2017; Sharma and Sirisoomboon 2019). Some studies have explored additional
    parameters such as fracture force, hardness, and compressive energy (Mohammadi-Moghaddam
    et al. 2018). These parameters can distinguish between varieties, making them
    essential for quality evaluation. Firmness, for instance, correlates with maturity
    and oil content in olives (Cirilli et al. 2016). Prediction of firmness, although
    complex, has yielded promising results, such as R2 values at peak regions using
    PLS regression in olives (Cirilli et al. 2016) and a high R2 value of 0.966 in
    cherry tomatoes using an extreme learning machine algorithm (Feng et al. 2019).
    Compression and penetrometer tests were performed concurrently on tomatoes, with
    the compression test demonstrating superior prediction performance (R2 = 0.85–0.97)
    (Camps and Gilli 2017). Additionally, a study on juicy stone fruits emphasized
    the significance of the compression test as the fruit matures (Labaky et al. 2020).
    Clustering of data may contribute to improved R2 values, although RMSE values
    may exhibit less variation (Camps and Gilli 2017). The integration of NIRS in
    fruit maturity testing has laid a solid foundation for future advancements. To
    further enhance its capabilities, multi-sensor fusion with other sensing technologies,
    advanced machine learning algorithms, and the development of portable NIRS devices
    for field applications are critical directions. Standardization and calibration
    across diverse fruit types, the implementation of online monitoring systems, and
    the creation of user-friendly consumer applications can ensure the widespread
    adoption of NIRS. Additionally, addressing environmental considerations and promoting
    sustainability in NIRS deployment will be essential. These future directions collectively
    hold the potential to not only refine fruit maturity assessment but also empower
    growers, producers, and consumers to make informed decisions, reduce food waste,
    and contribute to more efficient and sustainable fruit production and consumption
    practices. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques (NMR) NMR spectroscopy, NMR relaxometry,
    and magnetic resonance imaging are all components of the nuclear magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI). NMR spectroscopy operates on the principles of nuclear spin and
    magnetic resonance. In the context of fruit maturity testing, the principle involves
    the interaction of hydrogen nuclei (protons) within the water molecules present
    in the fruit tissue with a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency pulses (Chauhan
    and Singh 2012; Surya Kiran and Niranjana 2019). Protons possess a magnetic moment,
    and when placed in a magnetic field, they align with or against the field. When
    radiofrequency pulses are applied, they cause these protons to temporarily deviate
    from their alignment. As these protons return to their equilibrium state, they
    emit radiofrequency signals, which are detected and analyzed. The NMR instrument
    measures the time it takes for these signals to decay, known as relaxation times
    (T1 and T2), and the intensity of the signals. These relaxation times and signal
    intensities provide information about the physical and chemical properties of
    the fruit, including water content, mobility, and molecular interactions (Ebrahimnejad
    et al. 2018). This method can be used to determine a sample''s water and oil content.
    Although the pace of measurement is slow, MRI may produce high resolution images
    of the internal architecture of intact fruit. The assessment of water and oil
    is impacted by the presence of other dietary elements in the sample. The ice crystals
    created in food limit the spatially situated NMR signals, making them useful in
    determining the freeze damage caused during storage (Newton et al. 2017; Yodh
    2017). NMR spectroscopy is widely employed for assessing fruit maturity by determining
    key parameters without causing sample damage. One critical parameter in fruit
    maturity assessment is water content, which changes as fruits ripen. NMR enables
    precise and non-destructive measurements of water content variations during ripening
    stages. Additionally, NMR facilitates the measurement of sugar content and soluble
    solids, including sugars and organic acids, which tend to increase as fruits mature.
    This information serves as a valuable indicator of maturity. Furthermore, NMR
    can assess fruit texture and firmness by analyzing alterations in the molecular
    structure and mobility of water in fruit tissues, correlating with changes in
    fruit texture. This aids in pinpointing the optimal harvest time. Importantly,
    NMR''s non-destructive nature preserves sample integrity, making it suitable for
    quality control and research applications where destructive methods are unsuitable.
    It can seamlessly integrate into quality control and sorting systems, ensuring
    the selection of ripe, high-quality fruits for distribution, ultimately reducing
    food waste and elevating product quality (Nicolai et al. 2007; Borba et al. 2021).
    In a similar study, the authors aimed to explore the potential applications of
    Low-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) and MRI techniques in the study
    of water dynamics and the measurement of quality parameters in fruits and vegetables.
    The methodology involved an extensive literature review to gather insights from
    existing research, followed by conducting LF-NMR and MRI experiments on various
    fruit and vegetable samples. The acquired data allowed for the analysis of water
    dynamics within these samples, revealing correlations between relaxation times
    and physiological changes during ripening and aging. Furthermore, LF-NMR and MRI
    demonstrated their capability to measure critical quality parameters, such as
    moisture content, sugar levels, texture, and firmness, offering non-destructive
    and accurate assessments. This study concluded that LF-NMR and MRI hold substantial
    potential for enhancing the understanding of water behavior within agricultural
    produce and improving the assessment of their quality. Future objectives include
    refining methodologies, diversifying applications, integrating artificial intelligence,
    and promoting industry adoption of these technologies for more efficient quality
    control in the agricultural and food sectors (Kamal et al. 2019). In summary,
    NMR spectroscopy leverages nuclear spin and magnetic resonance principles to provide
    insightful information about fruit maturity. Its non-destructive capabilities
    and proficiency in measuring water content, sugar levels, and fruit texture position
    it as a powerful tool for fruit maturity testing and quality control within the
    agricultural and food industries. Time-resolved Reflectance Spectrometry (TRS)
    TRS is founded on the principle of measuring the time delay between a short light
    pulse''s emission and the detection of the reflected or transmitted light. This
    delay, known as the time-of-flight, is influenced by the interaction of light
    with the internal structure of fruit samples. TRS operates based on the concept
    that different tissue structures and compositions within fruits will scatter light
    in unique ways, affecting the time it takes for light to travel through the sample.
    By analyzing these time-resolved measurements, TRS can provide valuable insights
    into the internal properties of fruits, including water content, pigmentation,
    and tissue density, which are critical indicators of fruit maturity (Zerbini et
    al. 2009; Vanoli et al. 2011; Rizzolo et al. 2015). In the context of fruit maturity
    assessment, TRS has diverse applications. Firstly, it can be utilized to non-invasively
    determine water content, a parameter that changes during fruit ripening. As fruits
    mature, water content often diminishes due to various physiological processes
    (Rizzolo et al. 2015). TRS can precisely quantify these changes, aiding in the
    accurate assessment of fruit ripeness. Additionally, TRS can provide information
    about pigment composition and concentration within fruits, helping to assess attributes
    like color development and anthocyanin levels, which are indicative of maturity
    (Vanoli et al. 2011). Furthermore, TRS can be used to evaluate the density and
    structural properties of fruit tissues, such as cell wall integrity and firmness,
    offering valuable data for assessing the overall quality and ripeness of fruits.
    In summary, TRS is a powerful optical technique that can non-destructively assess
    various parameters related to fruit maturity, contributing to improved fruit quality
    and efficient harvesting practices (Zerbini et al. 2006). In a study conducted
    by Zerbini et al. (2006), the research aimed to assess the potential of TRS as
    a non-destructive tool for evaluating nectarine maturity at harvest and developing
    a predictive model for nectarine softening during storage. The methodology involved
    TRS measurements on nectarine samples at various ripeness stages during the harvest
    season. Key parameters such as water content, pigment composition, and tissue
    density were analyzed using TRS. These measurements were then correlated with
    traditional destructive methods and sensory evaluations to establish a comprehensive
    dataset for model development. The observations demonstrated that TRS accurately
    assessed nectarine maturity at harvest and predicted their softening behavior
    during storage. This research concluded that TRS holds significant promise as
    a valuable tool for optimizing harvest timing and post-harvest handling in the
    fruit industry. Future objectives include refining predictive models, expanding
    application to other fruit varieties, and integrating TRS into commercial fruit
    management practices to enhance quality and reduce waste. Similarly, Zerbini et
    al. (2009) aimed to investigate the practical application of TRS as a management
    tool within the fruit supply chain, specifically in an export trial involving
    nectarines. To achieve this, a comprehensive methodology was implemented. Nectarine
    samples at different ripeness stages underwent TRS analysis to assess parameters
    like water content, pigment composition, and tissue density. These TRS measurements
    were taken at critical points along the export supply chain, including pre-harvest,
    post-harvest, and transportation. Observations revealed that TRS provided real-time
    insights into fruit maturity, facilitating precise timing for harvest and post-harvest
    decisions. The study concluded that TRS could significantly enhance fruit quality
    and ripeness management in the export supply chain. Future objectives include
    further refining TRS methodologies for a wider range of fruit varieties and integrating
    real-time data analysis to optimize fruit quality and minimize losses during export
    (Zerbini et al. 2009). Recently, a study was undertaken to explore the non-destructive
    determination of ripeness in melon fruit utilizing TRS. The methodology involved
    conducting TRS measurements on melon samples at various stages of ripeness. Key
    optical parameters, including fluorescence decay times and reflectance spectra,
    were collected and analyzed using TRS techniques. These measurements were then
    correlated with traditional destructive methods, such as firmness and soluble
    solid content assessments, to establish a comprehensive dataset for model development.
    The observations indicated a strong correlation between TRS-derived optical parameters
    and melon fruit ripeness. The study concluded that TRS could effectively serve
    as a non-destructive tool for determining ripeness in melon fruit. Future objectives
    include refining the TRS models, expanding the application to different melon
    varieties, and integrating TRS into quality control processes to enhance fruit
    quality assessment and reduce waste (Vanoli et al. 2023). Despite its promise,
    TRS also presents challenges. It requires specialized equipment and expertise,
    making its implementation costly and complex. Additionally, TRS models may need
    further refinement to accommodate a broader range of fruit varieties and conditions,
    including different ripening patterns and textures. Looking ahead, the future
    scope of TRS in fruit maturity assessment is promising. Refinement of TRS methodologies,
    integration of real-time data analysis, and its application to a wider range of
    fruit varieties are essential goals. By addressing these challenges and objectives,
    TRS has the potential to revolutionize fruit quality management in the agricultural
    and food industries, leading to improved fruit quality, reduced waste, and enhanced
    consumer satisfaction. X-ray X-ray radiography is a non-destructive technology
    that offers valuable insights into the internal properties of fruits by displaying
    density differences using grayscale levels. This enables the identification of
    healthy fruits and those with pest damages while classifying them without the
    need for destructive sampling (Abdshaib et al. 2017; Diels et al. 2017). The varying
    densities inside fruits, influenced by factors such as water content, hard tissues,
    insect pest holes, hollowness, and corruption, are represented by different grayscale
    levels. X-ray radiography has found practical applications in fruit quality classification
    and disease detection, particularly in citrus fruits. Additionally, it has been
    utilized for sorting mature lettuce heads, assessing mango and tomato ripening
    based on tomography, and detecting surface defects in fruits using appearance
    images (Lenker et al. 1971; Barcelon et al. 2000; Brecht et al. 1991; Hernández-Sánchez
    et al. 2016). Furthermore, X-ray radiography plays a role in fruit quarantine
    by capturing and analyzing fluoroscopy images to identify problematic areas (Iqbal
    et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2008). However, it is important to note that while X-ray
    radiography can provide valuable qualitative analyses of fruit surfaces and internal
    structures, it primarily yields 2D and 3D images, unlike x-ray computed tomography
    (CT scanning) (Chauhan et al. 2017). With its ability to detect variations in
    density and water content, X-ray radiography holds promise for assessing fruit
    maturity and identifying internal flaws associated with physiological anomalies,
    ultimately contributing to enhanced fruit quality and reduced waste in the agricultural
    and food industries. The objective of the study by Hsiao et al. (2021) was to
    assess and investigate the feasibility of using X-ray imaging and information
    visualization for the ripeness assessment of lemons (Fig. 3). The methodology
    involved acquiring X-ray images of lemon samples at different ripeness stages
    and employing image processing techniques to extract relevant information. This
    information, including internal features and density variations within the lemons,
    was visualized and analyzed to determine the correlation between X-ray images
    and lemon ripeness. The results indicated that X-ray imaging combined with information
    visualization showed promise as a non-destructive method for assessing lemon ripening,
    with the capability to distinguish between different ripeness stages based on
    internal characteristics. However, a drawback of the study was the limited sample
    size, and future directions may involve expanding the research to a larger dataset,
    refining the image analysis algorithms, and exploring the application of this
    approach to other fruits for broader implications in the fruit industry. Fig.

    acquired at A median-plane and B axial-plane of the lemons.  (Source: Hsiao et
    al. 2021) Full size image Acoustic Impulse Response Method (AIRM) The AIRM is
    based on the principle of analyzing sound wave propagation through fruits to assess
    their internal properties, which can provide valuable information about fruit
    maturity. This non-destructive technique involves sending an acoustic impulse
    or pulse, typically in the form of a brief sound wave, into the fruit (Yamamoto
    et al. 1980). As the sound wave travels through the fruit, it interacts with the
    internal structures and properties, including density, moisture content, and texture.
    These interactions cause the sound wave to be reflected or refracted in different
    ways, resulting in a unique acoustic response or signature. By analyzing this
    impulse response, it is possible to gain insights into the fruit''s internal characteristics,
    such as ripeness, firmness, and moisture content. The AIRM finds applications
    in various aspects of fruit maturity assessment. One primary application is the
    determination of fruit firmness, which is a crucial indicator of maturity and
    quality. As fruits ripen, their firmness often changes due to alterations in cell
    structure and water content. The method can accurately measure this parameter
    by analyzing the speed and attenuation of sound waves passing through the fruit.
    Additionally, the method can be used to assess moisture content in fruits, which
    is another key factor in determining maturity. By evaluating the acoustic properties
    related to water content, it becomes possible to monitor the fruit''s moisture
    levels as it ripens. In the acoustic impulse response method utilized by Fathizadeh
    et al. (2019) and Yamamoto et al. (1980), a ball weighing 2 g and 8.5 g, respectively,
    is employed as an impactor. When this ball impacts the fruit, the resulting sound
    is captured by a microphone. Subsequently, Fourier transformation is applied to
    the captured sound data, allowing for the identification of the largest resonant
    frequency. This prominent frequency is then utilized to calculate the firmness
    index, a key parameter indicative of fruit quality. The schematic representation
    of the test apparatus used for implementing the acoustic impulse response method,
    illustrating the setup and components involved in this non-destructive technique
    for assessing fruit firmness. The acoustic impulse resonance frequency (AIF) technique
    utilises the natural frequencies of the whole fruit, which are obtained by recording
    the sound made by striking the fruit, and then applying a Fourier transformation
    to the recorded signal (Muramatsu et al. 2015). The frequency and mass of the
    fruit can be used to compute the stiffness factor for spherical fruit. This method
    includes measuring the resonance frequency that fruits produce, which changes
    as the fruits grow. Assessing the interior quality and ripeness of fruits involves
    calculating the impact response the fruit produces when a force is applied. The
    outcomes are delicate and rely on different characteristics (Chauhan et al. 2017).
    Similarly, a non-destructive method for assessing the internal quality of fruits,
    specifically apples and watermelons, using the acoustic impulse response technique.
    The methodology involved subjecting intact fruits to an acoustic impulse and measuring
    the resulting vibrational response. By analyzing the natural frequency derived
    from these acoustic responses, the researchers aimed to correlate this parameter
    with the internal quality attributes of the fruits. The results indicated that
    the natural frequency obtained through the acoustic impulse response method was
    a promising indicator of fruit quality. It demonstrated sensitivity to variations
    in fruit texture and internal attributes, such as firmness and juiciness. However,
    a drawback of the study may have been the need for specialized equipment and calibration
    procedures, which could limit its practical application. Future directions in
    this research could involve further refinement of the method, including the development
    of user-friendly tools and protocols for wider implementation in the fruit industry.
    Additionally, exploring the method''s applicability to a broader range of fruit
    types and sizes would enhance its utility in non-destructive quality assessment
    (Yamamoto et al. 1980). Fathizadeh et al. (2020) developed a nondestructive method
    for predicting the firmness of apple fruits using acoustic vibration response,
    as firmness is a crucial quality parameter in apples. The methodology involved
    sample preparation with apples of varying ripeness levels, employing an acoustic
    vibration system to induce surface vibrations on the fruits and recording their
    acoustic responses using sensors. Data analysis comprised extracting features
    like frequency and amplitude from the acoustic data. A calibration model was constructed,
    correlating these acoustic features with reference firmness values obtained through
    traditional destructive testing. Validation confirmed the model''s potential in
    accurately predicting firmness nondestructively. While promising, this approach
    should address sample variability and undergo further validation on a broader
    range of apple samples. Future directions may focus on enhancing accuracy, real-time
    applications, multimodal approaches, and automation, offering significant improvements
    in fruit quality assessment practices. Ultrasonic The evaluation of fruit ripeness
    and maturity is paramount for optimizing harvesting, transportation-marketing,
    and consumption (Chauhan et al. 2017; Magwaza and Tesfay 2015). However, ripe
    fruit is highly susceptible to mechanical damage, microbiological decay, and physiological
    deterioration. In this context, the application of ultrasonic technology emerges
    as a promising nondestructive solution (Cao et al. 2010). Ultrasonic methods offer
    several advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, robustness, reliability, and safety
    for fruits, making them a preferred choice among nondestructive techniques (Kim
    et al. 2009; Morrison et al. 2014; Valente et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2013). Ultrasonic
    measurement relies on changes in the attenuation and velocity of ultrasonic waves,
    which are sound waves with frequencies higher than the human hearing limit. These
    waves interact with matter through absorption and scattering, and these interactions
    can be correlated with internal fruit factors (Awad et al. 2012). Parameters like
    acidity, viscosity, and sugar content can be evaluated through ultrasonic methods,
    with velocity and attenuation being dependent on the physical properties of the
    fruit and the frequency of sound propagation within the fruit (Mizrach 2004; Mizrach
    2008; Kuo et al. 2008). While ultrasonic methods have proven fast, accurate, and
    nondestructive for fruit quality evaluation, existing ultrasonic systems have
    limitations, particularly in non-laboratory and field applications. Furthermore,
    these systems are typically designed for specific fruit species, lacking versatility.
    To address these issues, a custom-designed ultrasonic system was developed, enabling
    users to adjust frequency, amplitude, pulse repetition frequency, and the number
    of pulses in a burst. Notably, this system offers a broader frequency range from
    10 kHz to 10 MHz, in contrast to market devices that often start at 500 kHz. This
    flexibility is crucial for monitoring fruit quality in various scenarios, including
    picking, storing, packaging sites, as well as laboratory-based applications. Nevertheless,
    nondestructive ultrasonic methods alone are insufficient for comprehensive fruit
    quality assessment. To obtain a holistic understanding, it''s essential to acquire
    physical characteristics such as size, shape, and volume. By combining a custom-designed
    ultrasonic system with a non-contact physical measurement unit, superior fruit
    quality assessment can be achieved. Yildiz et al. (2019) aimed to create a complete
    nondestructive quality evaluation system using (a) ultrasonic testing and (b)
    volume estimation through automatic machine vision techniques. This approach involved
    programmable ultrasonic components, piezoelectric probes, an oscilloscope, and
    computer-based systems for ultrasonic testing (Fig. 4). Additionally, a machine
    vision system captured multiple fruit images for volume calculation. This method
    demonstrated the potential for highly accurate quality assessment (Yildiz et al.
    2019). Mizrach (2000) developed a nondestructive ultrasonic measurement system
    to assess transmission parameters related to the maturity, firmness, and quality
    of avocado and mango fruits. Low-frequency probes measured ultrasonic signal attenuation,
    which changed as the fruit ripened and softened. Statistical analysis revealed
    quantitative relations between ultrasonic parameters and fruit quality attributes,
    such as oil content, dry weight percentage, and firmness. These findings open
    avenues for nondestructive assessment of fruit maturity and firmness, eliminating
    the need for invasive methods (Mizach, 2000). In another study, the characteristics
    of fruit tissue and its maturity stage were determined by measuring the attenuation
    coefficient and wave velocity of ultrasonic waves as they passed through the fruit.
    The study focused on Tabrizi variety peaches at different ripeness stages. Results
    showed strong correlations between attenuation coefficient and hardness, as well
    as wave velocity and pH and acidity. This research provides valuable insights
    into nondestructive methods for assessing fruit quality and maturity (Abolghasemi
    et al.2009). In conclusion, non-destructive ultrasonic methods, when combined
    with physical measurements and advanced technologies, offer a promising approach
    for evaluating fruit quality and maturity. These techniques not only enhance our
    understanding of fruit characteristics but also provide practical solutions for
    the industry''s needs, from harvesting to storage and beyond. Fig. 4 The schematic

    2019) Full size image Image processing Color perception is a critical sensory
    attribute influencing consumer acceptance of food products. Ensuring consistent
    color and appearance in food items relies on accurate color measurement techniques.
    Recent advancements in computer vision technology, driven by camera-computer systems,
    have enabled automated detection systems for agricultural and food products. Computer
    vision involves image capture, processing, and analysis, providing an objective
    and non-destructive approach to assess visual quality in food products. Owing
    to hardware and software advancements, cost-effective solutions have emerged,
    leading to the increased adoption of computer vision systems within the food industry.
    These systems offer non-destructive and cost-efficient means for sorting and grading
    agricultural and food products during processing and for commercial applications
    (Xiao et al. 2023). The process of quality inspection for fruits and vegetables
    using image processing techniques generally comprises five steps: Image acquisition,
    Pre-processing, Image segmentation, Feature extraction, and Classification (Fig.
    5). Image acquisition is a critical initial step, as the quality of the acquired
    image significantly affects subsequent processing outcomes. Various tools, including
    cameras, ultrasound, MRI, electrical tomography, and computed tomography (CT),
    are employed for image acquisition. Digital images are generated using complementary
    metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and charged coupled device (CCD) image sensors
    (Bhargava et al. 2021). Fig. 5 A classical computer vision system.  (Source: Wei
    et al. 2017) Full size image A typical computer vision system consists of five
    fundamental components: lighting, an image capture board (digitizer or frame grabber),
    a camera, computer hardware, and software. In fruit and vegetable analysis, lighting
    systems are categorized as front and back lighting. Front lighting assesses surface
    quality attributes such as color, texture, and skin defects, while back lighting
    is utilized for evaluating boundary quality attributes like size and shape. Conventional,
    spectral, and hyperspectral computer vision systems have been extensively studied
    for quality analysis of food and agricultural products (Bhargava et al. 2021).
    Color is a vital factor impacting consumers'' decisions regarding fruits and vegetables.
    It indirectly reflects quality attributes such as freshness, desirability, variety,
    maturity, and safety, influenced by physical, chemical, biochemical, and microbial
    changes occurring during growth, ripening, and postharvest processing. Color features
    are essential for image retrieval and indexing, with the RGB color space, hyperspectral
    imaging (HSI) color space, and CIE-LAB color space being commonly used. Various
    color features, including color correlogram, color coherence vector, color moments,
    and color histogram, have been proposed for color extraction. Among these, color
    moments, such as mean, standard deviation, and skewness, are widely utilized.
    While the RGB color model is popular for image capture, it lacks linearity with
    human vision and requires transformation techniques to standardize values. In
    contrast, the HSI color space is preferred for color-based algorithms, closely
    resembling human perception (Kuswandi et al. 2011; Gupta et al. 2022a). However,
    it is less suitable for evaluating color transformations during processing. The
    CIE-LAB color space, designed as a device-independent model, offers cognitive
    uniformity, representing color differences perceived by humans as Euclidean distances
    in the CIE-LAB space. This makes it a suitable method for assessing object color
    (Table 3). Table 3 Comparison summary of intelligent systems in fruit packaging
    container Full size table Hyperspectral imaging technique Hyperspectral imaging
    technique was used to classify the background and growth stages of blueberry fruit.
    Four information theory-based band selection methods alongwith machine and deep
    learning were applied to assess the performance of the selected bands by the four
    methods. The selected bands attain 88% and higher accuracies of classification.
    Therefore, the maturity stages of blueberry fruit can be detected using the band
    selection methods, which are capable of reducing the volume of the hyperspectral
    data and constructing a multispectral imaging system (Yang et al. 2014). A similar
    study was investigated by Munera et al. (2017), where the hyperspectral images
    of unripe, mid-ripe, and ripe strawberries were used to extract spectral data
    for evaluation of ripeness of strawberry using hyperspectral imaging. The optimal
    wavelengths were acquired between spectra of 441.1–1013.97 and 941.46–1578.13
    nm by loadings of PCA. The images obtained were used to extract optimal wavelengths
    and pattern texture features such as contrast, correlation, homogeneity and entropy.
    To build classification models on full spectral data, texture features, optimal
    wavelength and the combined dataset of texture features, and optimal wavelengths,
    respectively, support vector machine (SVM) was used. Among all datasets, SVM models
    using combined datasets performed the best. The SVM models using datasets from
    hyperspectral images at 441.1–1013.97 nm gave a better performance with 85% or
    more classification accuracy. Munera and co-worker assessed the efficacy of hyspectral
    reflectance imaging for the evaluation of internal quality and sensorial attributes
    by means of Ripening Index (RPI) and the Internal Quality Index (IQI) of ‘Big
    Top’ and ‘Magique’ nectarines (Prunus persica L. Batsch var. nucipersica). During
    the ripening of fruit under controlled conditions, the hyperspectral images of
    the whole fruits were taken, and their physicochemical properties were also determined.
    The correlation coefficient was found higher than 0.87 for the two cultivars and
    indices. The partial least square (PLS) models and IQI have shown promising results
    for further monitoring of the nectarine maturity in industrial setups (Munera
    et al. 2017). In a similar study, HI was examined by Yan et al. (2017) in fresh
    cut celeries to calculate soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber
    (IDF) contents and visualize their spatial distribution during 28-day of storage
    periods. A superior techniques, Genetic synergy interval partial least square
    (GA-Si-PLS) algorithm and Si-PLS were developed to establish a calibration model
    to achieve the highest prediction performance. The developed GA-Si-PLS models
    were then applied pixel-wise to visualize the spatial distribution of IDF and
    SDF contents during storage successfully. The study determines that HSI could
    be helpful in real-time IDF and SDF contents monitoring in industry and vegetable
    research. Recently, the maturity and ripening stages of fruits has been productively
    examined by thermal imaging (TI). Fresh palm fruit was successfully classified
    into five stages using two TI camers and different approaches were selected designate
    the relation between the stages of maturity of palm fruits (Zolfagharnassab et
    al. 2016). Hongwiangjan et al. (2015) evaluated pomelo maturity using peel optical
    properties and characteristics. A multivariate classifying model with the discriminant
    analysis is developed using optical parameters and peel related variables. The
    accuracy of classifying all samples into mature, late-mature, early-mature, and
    immature groups was 83.3%. A variation of green color between the oil gland and
    the peel surface was the most distinctive difference between a group of the immature
    and the early-mature pomeloes from a group of the late-mature and mature pomelos.
    Artificial intelligence AI techniques have gained significant traction in the
    horticultural, agricultural, and food industries, offering opportunities for the
    development of intelligent systems, particularly with the introduction of machine
    learning (ML). ML, a subset of AI, employs algorithms to discern patterns in data
    and make informed decisions (Nturambirwe & Opara 2020). With the increasing affordability
    and accessibility of computing power, the integration of AI and ML in hyperspectral
    imaging system research is witnessing a surge. The success of AI in hyperspectral
    imaging can be attributed to its advantages over RGB imaging. AI techniques applied
    to hyperspectral imaging data can uncover correlations with quality parameters
    that may elude the naked eye due to the richness of spectral and spatial data
    in a single image. This synergy between hyperspectral data and advanced AI techniques
    opens new avenues for enhancing the quality control of fresh produce. Efforts
    to discover effective food assessment methods are centered on enabling efficient
    control and evaluation of food products. In this context, artificial intelligence
    methods supported by computer analysis prove invaluable for various decision-making
    processes and tasks related to food processing and preservation. Non-invasive
    technologies with minimal costs are imperative for ensuring high-quality food
    products, and image processing technology has gained increasing popularity in
    this context. Computer vision technology, a pivotal component of image processing,
    finds diverse applications, encompassing the identification, dimensioning, and
    quality assessment of kernels, tubers, vegetables, and fruits. It is also instrumental
    in pest identification, the evaluation of muscle and joint health, analysis of
    drying processes, fruit color and classification, as well as leaf area measurement.
    Researchers have developed various image processing-based systems, such as the
    Liming and Yanchao strawberry classification system, which categorizes fruits
    based on their size, shape, and color (Al-Sammarraie 2022). While commercial software
    can assist in data analysis, its limitations may impede scientific progress. Researchers
    are increasingly turning to new algorithms and data analysis workflows, often
    developed using free programming environments like Python or Octave. Open-source
    projects like Orange data mining software provide standardized data processing
    workflows for various machine learning problems, streamlining data processing
    and analysis (Nakhle et al. 2021). The potential of artificial intelligence systems
    has piqued the interest of scientists for future applications. An example is the
    use of artificial neural networks to non-invasively recognize orange flavor based
    on a color space model. A study conducted by Al-Sammarraie et al. (2022) explored
    the relationship between RGB values of orange fruits and their sweetness, determining
    the algorithm with the highest prediction accuracy. This interdisciplinary research
    bridges the gap between AI, image processing, and food science, presenting exciting
    prospects for future advancements in quality assessment and flavor recognition.
    The integration of hyperspectral imaging with artificial intelligence techniques
    holds immense promise in revolutionizing the evaluation of fruit and vegetable
    quality. By harnessing the power of AI and machine learning, researchers and industries
    can unlock the potential of non-destructive and cost-effective methods for assessing
    produce attributes, ultimately enhancing freshness, flavor, and overall consumer
    satisfaction. As the fields of computer vision, image processing, and AI continue
    to advance, we can anticipate further innovative solutions that will drive the
    food industry towards more efficient and accurate quality control measures. With
    a growing emphasis on data analysis, open-source platforms like Orange data mining
    software offer invaluable resources for researchers to develop and implement cutting-edge
    algorithms. The pursuit of artificial intelligence systems in food science represents
    a significant leap forward in addressing the challenges of modern food assessment
    and holds immense potential for shaping the future of quality evaluation in the
    agricultural and food sectors (Lu et al. 2017). Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    ANN is employed for the detection of fruit samples'' shape, size, and color. To
    ensure widespread usability, the android mobile platform was chosen, making the
    proposed model accessible to numerous users. This image-based computer vision
    approach allows for non-destructive assessment and grading of fruit and vegetable
    quality. For evaluating the quality of oranges, SVM was utilized. Similarly, the
    firmness of kiwifruit is predicted using ANN and linear regressions to determine
    its quality. The effectiveness of image-based grading using various machine learning
    algorithms is demonstrated and explained. An Android app is developed to distinguish
    between naturally and artificially ripened fruits. Additionally, an image processing-based
    approach is implemented to count calories based on extracted features from an
    image. Furthermore, vegetable quality is measured using an ANN-based technique.
    These advancements in artificial intelligence and image processing hold great
    promise for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of quality assessment in the
    fruit and vegetable industry. The utilization of ANNs in the evaluation of fruit
    and vegetable quality has gained significant attention in recent years. ANNs are
    powerful machine learning algorithms capable of learning complex patterns from
    data, making them well-suited for tasks such as detecting the shape, size, and
    color of fruit samples. By employing ANNs, researchers and industries aim to develop
    efficient and accurate grading systems that can assess the quality of produce
    with minimal human intervention (Zhou et al. 2023). To ensure the widespread adoption
    of such systems, the importance of a user-friendly platform cannot be overstated.
    Recognizing the popularity and accessibility of Android mobile devices, researchers
    have opted for this platform to implement their fruit and vegetable grading applications.
    This mobile-based approach empowers end-users, including farmers, distributors,
    and consumers, to conveniently and effortlessly assess the quality of produce.
    This convenience and accessibility render the proposed model highly appealing
    to a broad spectrum of users, potentially revolutionizing the grading and trading
    of fruits and vegetables in the market (Miranda et al. 2023). For instance, SVMs
    have been effectively employed in determining the quality of oranges based on
    various parameters, facilitating efficient sorting and grading of oranges for
    diverse markets or processing purposes. Similarly, ANN and linear regression models
    can predict the firmness of kiwifruit, a crucial quality attribute, ensuring optimal
    ripeness and market suitability. Furthermore, this research delves into the effectiveness
    of different machine learning algorithms in grading fruits and vegetables. By
    comparing and analyzing the performance of various algorithms, researchers can
    pinpoint the most suitable method for specific produce and quality attributes.
    These insights contribute significantly to the development of robust and accurate
    grading systems tailored to the distinctive characteristics of different fruits
    and vegetables (Wieme et al. 2022). Beyond grading, the application of artificial
    intelligence and image processing extends to various facets of the fruit and vegetable
    industry. Researchers have developed mobile applications capable of distinguishing
    between naturally and artificially ripened fruits, instilling consumer confidence
    in the produce they purchase. Moreover, through the extraction of features from
    images, AI-powered apps can estimate calorie content, aiding individuals in making
    healthier dietary choices. The continuous evolution and integration of artificial
    intelligence, machine learning, and image processing technologies hold immense
    promise for the transformation of the fruit and vegetable industry. From enhanced
    quality control to an improved consumer experience, these advancements contribute
    to more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable fruit and vegetable production
    and distribution processes. As researchers persist in exploring novel algorithms
    and approaches, the future of AI-driven fruit and vegetable quality assessment
    shines brightly, offering exciting possibilities for the entire agricultural and
    food sectors (Wieme et al. 2022). The integration of artificial intelligence,
    machine learning, and image processing technologies into the evaluation of fruit
    and vegetable quality signifies a significant stride forward for the agricultural
    and food industries. These cutting-edge approaches, encompassing artificial neural
    networks and support vector machines, enable precise, non-destructive, and real-time
    grading of produce attributes, ushering in a revolution in how fruits and vegetables
    are assessed, traded, and consumed. These proposed models have the potential to
    captivate a wide range of users, from farmers to consumers, by leveraging the
    power of mobile-based applications and user-friendly platforms, thus enhancing
    the accessibility and efficacy of quality assessment across the supply chain.
    The triumph of these AI-driven methods ushers in fresh opportunities for research
    and development in fruit and vegetable quality control, with exciting prospects
    for elevating freshness, ripeness, safety, and overall consumer satisfaction.
    As these technologies continue to evolve and researchers explore additional applications,
    the future of fruit and vegetable quality assessment stands on the cusp of transformative
    advancements, shaping a more sustainable and technology-driven agriculture and
    food industry (Ben Ayed & Hanana 2021; Wieme et al. 2022). Convolutional neural
    network The effectiveness of CNN models in comparison to other machine learning
    techniques was established through extensive experimentation with a diverse dataset
    comprising various fruits and vegetables. In the model training phase, once the
    dataset was curated, a series of preprocessing steps were employed to enhance
    image quality and remove extraneous information. These preprocessing techniques
    played a pivotal role in improving classification accuracy. Initially, standardization
    of images reduced data loss, followed by data augmentation to expand the dataset
    and enhance model performance. Subsequently, image characteristics encompassing
    color, shape, size, and texture were extracted. These extracted features were
    then utilized to train the classifier. Figure 6 illustrates the CNN system, a
    deep learning algorithm, which effectively serves as a classifier for image recognition
    by processing pixel grids (Naranjo-Torres et al. 2020). Fig. 6 Model of CNN.  (Source:
    Wang et al. 2022) Full size image In a recent study conducted by Azadnia et al.
    (2023), an automated machine learning-based algorithm was developed to assess
    the maturity level of hawthorn fruits, a critical parameter influencing their
    suitability for various applications. The research involved assembling a comprehensive
    dataset of hawthorn images captured at distinct maturity stages, each exhibiting
    unique colors and textures. Image preprocessing techniques were meticulously applied
    to standardize and enhance image quality. Machine learning algorithms, notably
    CNNs, were employed to train a model capable of categorizing hawthorns into distinct
    maturity levels based on their visual attributes. The results unequivocally demonstrated
    the algorithm''s exceptional accuracy in classifying hawthorns by maturity level.
    Nevertheless, a notable drawback of the study pertained to the dataset''s limited
    size, which could potentially impact the model''s robustness and general applicability.
    To further advance this research, future endeavors may encompass dataset expansion,
    the incorporation of spectral imaging for deeper analysis, and the integration
    of the automated algorithm into hawthorn sorting and processing systems. These
    steps aim to bolster quality control measures and enhance decision-making processes
    during hawthorn harvesting and processing operations. Application of AI in fruits
    and vegetables Disease diagnosis Image pre-processing is an essential step in
    segmenting leaf images, distinguishing background, non-diseased portions, and
    diseased areas. This segmentation facilitates the efficient transmission of diseased
    portions to remote laboratories for further examination. Furthermore, image pre-processing
    enables real-time pest identification, detection of nutrient deficiencies, and
    disease diagnosis recommendations. These advancements contribute significantly
    to reducing pesticide losses, minimizing soil and groundwater contamination, and
    mitigating the risk of pesticide residues in the human food system. Additionally,
    the automation and efficiency brought about by image pre-processing address labor
    shortages in agricultural practices (Subeesh and Mehta 2021). Figure 7 provides
    a comprehensive view of citrus fruit images, specifically highlighting various
    peel conditions. These images encompass healthy fruits and fruits affected by
    five distinct types of blemishes, including Huanglongbing (HLB), black spot, melanosis,
    canker, and scab. Each condition is carefully selected and depicted for clarity
    and reference. In Fig. 7A, we see a citrus sample with a healthy peel condition,
    serving as a reference point for comparison. In Fig. 7B, we observe HLB, a disease
    caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, associated with stunted growth, improper
    fruit coloring, leading to green and misshapen fruits with a curved central core,
    deformities, and cracking (Doh et al. 2019). Figure 7C showcases black spots on
    fruits, with diameters ranging from 0.12 to 0.4, which may appear small and circular
    but carry significant implications (Chen et al. 2021). Melanose, induced by Diaporthe
    citri, is displayed in Fig. 7D, characterized by scattered, raised brown to black
    blotches (Trivedi et al. 2021). Figure 7E depicts citrus scabs, fungal infections
    more severe in regions with frequent wetting, resulting in tiny, gritty, irregularly
    shaped dots (Khan et al. 2021). Finally, in Fig. 7F, we observe canker with fruit
    spot diameters ranging from 1 to 10 mm, covered by water-soaked, yellow, curvilinear
    blemishes (Poongodi et al. 2022). Fig. 7 Healthy and infected citrus fruit images.  (Source:
    Dhiman et al. 2023) Full size image In a recent study by Dhiman et al. (2023),
    a precise fruit disease identification model, known as \"PFDI,\" was developed,
    leveraging context data fusion techniques within an edge computing environment.
    The primary objective of this research is to create an accurate, efficient, and
    dependable model for the detection of fruit diseases, which is a vital component
    of autonomous food production on a robotic edge platform. This study delves into
    the analysis and investigation of four distinct Citrus fruit diseases using CNN
    deep learning models, intended for use as edge computing solutions. Initially,
    a sequential model is employed to identify Citrus diseases, including cankers,
    black spots, greening, scab, melanosis, and healthy citrus fruits (as depicted
    in Fig. 7). This identification process begins without pruning and then proceeds
    with varying levels of sparsity following pruning, followed by post quantization.
    Figure 8 provides an overview of the Edge computing architecture within the proposed
    model. This architecture comprises four primary modules, each serving specific
    functions: 1) Collector nodes, 2) Deployment of web services or edge computing,
    3) Prediction processes, model pruning, and quantization, and 4) User applications.
    The third module plays a pivotal role by bridging the gap between locally-based
    and remote functions within the platform. Initially, data is collected from the
    public domain at the local level. However, as the data is initiated, edge services
    come into play for processing and computational tasks. Fig. 8 Overall edge computing
    architecture.  (Source: Dhiman et al. 2023) Full size image In this study, a transfer
    learning approach is employed to fine-tune the model for fruit disease detection
    by integrating visual data from two sources: Near-Infrared (NIR) and RGB. Authors
    evaluated early and late data fusion techniques for effectively integrating information
    from both NIFR and RGB models. The results of this approach are promising, with
    the proposed model achieving impressive accuracy rates for various diseases, including
    canker disease at 97%, scab at 95%, melanosis at 99%, greening at 97%, black spot
    at 97%, and healthy at 97%. The authors compared and evaluated the results of
    the proposed model with different sparsity levels, ranging from 50 to 80%, 60%
    to 90%, 70% to 90%, and 80% to 90% pruning. Additionally, the study examined the
    outcomes of post-quantization at each sparsity level. The findings indicate that
    by utilizing 60% to 90% pruning, the model''s size can be significantly reduced
    without a substantial loss of accuracy. Moreover, post-quantization further reduces
    the model size, enhancing both precision and efficiency. An important advantage
    of this approach is its reduced dependence on pixel-level annotations, requiring
    only bounding box annotations for the implementation of new fruit disease detection
    methods. While the study presents promising results, it is worth noting a potential
    limitation related to the dataset''s size and diversity, which may affect the
    model''s adaptability to different fruit types and disease conditions. Future
    research directions may involve expanding the dataset to encompass a broader range
    of fruit species and disease manifestations, fine-tuning the model''s architecture,
    and optimizing edge computing resources to enhance overall efficiency and applicability.
    The PFDI model represents a significant advancement in fruit disease identification,
    offering precise and real-time insights that have the potential to revolutionize
    disease management practices in agriculture (Dhiman et al. 2023). In a recent
    study, Azgomi et al. (2023) developed an effective system for diagnosing apple
    fruit diseases by combining image processing techniques and ANNs. The research
    aimed to create a comprehensive dataset of apple fruit images, including those
    with symptoms of common diseases like apple scab, apple rot, and healthy apples
    for reference. The image preprocessing phase was meticulously carried out to standardize
    image quality and extract pertinent features, with a focus on attributes such
    as color, texture, and shape. CNNs, a subtype of ANNs, were employed for image
    classification. The dataset was partitioned into training and testing sets to
    evaluate the model''s accuracy in distinguishing healthy apples from those affected
    by specific diseases, thus facilitating early disease detection and management.
    The study demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in diagnosing apple fruit
    diseases accurately. However, future directions for this research include expanding
    the dataset to encompass a broader range of diseases and environmental conditions,
    optimizing ANN architectures, and integrating real-time disease diagnosis into
    practical orchard applications (Azgomi et al. 2023). Identifying crop maturity
    Images of various crops are captured under white/UV-A light to determine the proper
    stage of maturity of fruits. Farmers can create different maturity grades based
    on crop/fruit category and stack them separately before sending them to market,
    especially for highly perishable horticulture crops, and harvesting at proper
    maturity will increase post-harvest shelf life. In a study, an automated deep
    learning-based system was developed to accurately detect tomato maturity. The
    methodology involved collecting a comprehensive dataset of tomato images at different
    ripeness stages, categorizing them into specific classes. CNNs served as the core
    of the system, and the dataset was divided into training and testing sets for
    model development and evaluation. Data augmentation techniques were applied to
    enhance dataset diversity, and the CNN model was trained to recognize ripeness-related
    features. The results showcased the system''s efficiency in precisely classifying
    tomatoes by ripeness, reducing the need for manual sorting and inspection in agriculture
    and food processing. Despite its success, potential limitations included dataset
    diversity and sensitivity to environmental conditions, which could be addressed
    in future research by expanding the dataset and improving robustness under varying
    scenarios. Future directions may also involve integration with food industry sorting
    systems and application to other fruits and vegetables for maturity detection
    (Mutha et al. 2021). Similarly, the objective of another research endeavor was
    to employ a machine and deep learning approach using multispectral data to predict
    crucial agricultural parameters in soybean cultivation, including days to maturity,
    plant height, and grain yield. The methodology involved collecting multispectral
    data from soybean fields, covering various spectral bands, which were then utilized
    to develop predictive models. Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques
    were both harnessed to create models capable of forecasting days to maturity,
    plant height, and grain yield. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of these
    models in providing accurate predictions for these vital agricultural attributes,
    facilitating precision agriculture practices. However, one potential drawback
    of the study was the requirement for substantial computational resources when
    implementing deep learning approaches. Future directions in this research area
    may involve optimizing computational efficiency, expanding the dataset to encompass
    diverse environmental conditions, and integrating these predictive models into
    real-world farming applications to enhance soybean cultivation and overall crop
    management (Teodero et al. 2021). Fruit grading In recent years, the application
    of image processing in fruit grading has gained prominence due to its pivotal
    role in the post-harvest process. Fruit grading involves the categorization of
    fruits based on parameters such as disease severity, defects, and contamination,
    a task traditionally executed manually, known for its time-consuming and error-prone
    nature. Consequently, the need for an automated and faster grading system became
    evident. One such reliable solution is the application of automatic image processing
    techniques for fruit sorting and grading. Numerous studies have concentrated on
    harnessing the power of ML techniques, including SVM and ANN, to train models
    for the automatic classification and sorting of fruits like dragon fruits, based
    on attributes such as size, color, and ripeness. The outcomes of these studies
    have showcased the feasibility of this approach, boasting high accuracy in grading
    and sorting dragon fruits, effectively reducing manual labor and ensuring consistent
    fruit quality throughout the agricultural supply chain. However, a potential drawback
    of these studies lies in their limited generalization to varying environmental
    conditions and diverse fruit varieties. To address these limitations, future directions
    in this field may encompass refining the algorithms for enhanced robustness, scalability
    to handle larger datasets, and integration with real-world fruit sorting systems
    to further augment the efficiency and accuracy of dragon fruit grading and sorting
    (Patil et al. 2021). Additionally, Menon et al. (2021) have made significant strides
    in advancing digital fruit grading and sorting techniques through the application
    of cutting-edge technologies like computer vision, machine learning, and image
    processing. Their research underscores the efficiency and accuracy of these automated
    systems, presenting a notable advantage over traditional manual sorting methods.
    To ensure broader adoption across the fruit industry, future directions should
    prioritize efforts to enhance the scalability and affordability of these technologies,
    particularly catering to the needs of smaller producers. Furthermore, research
    endeavors should explore the integration of hyperspectral imaging and advanced
    machine learning algorithms to enable more comprehensive fruit quality assessment.
    Additionally, addressing sustainability concerns and investigating applications
    related to food waste reduction and supply chain optimization present critical
    avenues for future research in this domain. Collaboration among academia, industry
    stakeholders, and policymakers will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in advancing
    these innovations and ensuring their successful implementation throughout the
    fruit industry, promising more efficient and effective fruit grading and sorting
    processes in the future. Biosensors Biosensors play a vital role in assessing
    fruit maturity and ripeness, offering a non-destructive and real-time method for
    evaluating fruit quality (Ma et al. 2016). These innovative devices utilize biological
    components, such as enzymes or antibodies, to detect specific molecules or compounds
    related to fruit maturation processes. One common biosensor application in fruit
    maturity assessment is the detection of ethylene gas. Ethylene is a natural plant
    hormone responsible for triggering fruit ripening processes. As fruits mature,
    they release ethylene gas, and its concentration can be a reliable indicator of
    the fruit''s ripeness. Biosensors equipped with ethylene-sensitive elements can
    accurately measure ethylene levels in the fruit''s vicinity, allowing growers
    and producers to determine the optimal harvest time (Gupta et al. 2022a; Gupta
    et al. 2023; Medhi et al. 2022). Additionally, biosensors can target other biochemical
    markers that change during fruit maturation, such as sugars, acids, and volatile
    compounds responsible for flavor development. For example, certain enzymes or
    receptors can be integrated into the biosensor to detect the levels of specific
    sugars like glucose and fructose, which increase as the fruit ripens. The use
    of biosensors in fruit maturity assessment offers several advantages (Senapati
    et al. (2022). Firstly, they provide real-time data, enabling timely harvesting
    to ensure fruits are picked at their peak quality (Gupta et al. 2022a). This not
    only enhances consumer satisfaction but also reduces post-harvest losses. Secondly,
    biosensors are non-destructive, meaning they do not harm the fruit during measurement,
    making them ideal for quality control in large-scale fruit processing facilities.
    The development of biosensors for fruit maturity assessment is an ongoing area
    of research, and advancements in nanotechnology and biotechnology continue to
    enhance their sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use (Yumnam et al. 2022).
    Moreover, the integration of biosensor data with artificial intelligence and machine
    learning algorithms allows for more accurate and precise predictions of fruit
    ripening trends, enabling optimized supply chain management and distribution (Kuswandi
    et al. 2022). Hawari et al. (2012) fabr icated the molecularly imprint polymer
    (MIP) based sensor to determine the mango aroma volatiles. In the MIP technique,
    molecules possess the ability of molecular recognition at low interference level.
    For decades, MIP has been effectively used to produce the material having more
    selective adsorption towards a particular molecule. The basic concept of MIP development
    includes the pre-arrangement of a functional monomer and a template, followed
    by polymerization using a cross-linker at a certain temperature. Once the template
    is removed, it leaves a cavity that is selective to the targeted template only
    MIP was fabricated by pre-arranging the functional monomer (methacrylic acid)
    and template followed by polymerization using cross-linker, which will form the
    MIP complex at a certain temperature. The template used is the imprinting molecule,
    which forms a receptor site with binding features according to the morphology
    of the molecule and spatial orientation of the peripheral functionality. When
    the templates are removed, it forms a cavity having selective nature. Computational
    aids such as computer software were employed for designing the MIP, which is both
    time and cost-effective. In the understanding of the intermolecular interaction
    in the molecular system, HyperChem software simulation was used. It helps to retrieve
    essential information that lead to stable MIP such as the Binding Energy (ΔE)
    between the template and the functional monomer. In this study, different array
    MIPs template, including α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene were designed and fabricated
    onto the surface of quartz crystal microbalance (QCMs). Then, polymerize the coated
    MIPs, followed by the removal of templates molecules that would leave the cavity
    of selective templates. The synthesized QCM arrays were able to make a clear distinction
    between different terpenes gases due to its sensitivity and selectivity properties
    and quickly identified the gases released from the mangoes during the ripening.
    The optimal plucking time of fruits and may help in ensuring the quality and standards
    of the cultivar using the MIP technology. It is important to distinguish between
    maturation and ripening, as they represent different qualities in the fruit''s
    growth process. Maturation pertains to the biological growth rate of the fruit,
    whereas ripening refers to the development that brings the fruit to a desirable
    stage for consumption. This stage is often assessed based on color and physical
    texture, as well as the attainment of the desired fruity aroma and flavor. Certain
    fruits exhibit climacteric and non-climacteric characteristics, which impact their
    post-harvest ripening behaviour. Climacteric fruits, like bananas, continue to
    ripen after being picked, and their freshness is closely tied to ripeness and
    ethylene emission. On the other hand, non-climacteric fruits, like strawberries,
    do not undergo significant ripening after being harvested. The freshness of climacteric
    and succulent fruits is strongly linked to their ripening process and ethylene
    levels, while non-climacteric and aggregate fruits'' freshness depends on factors
    like time, temperature, and potential spoilage indicators such as pH and color.
    Recent advances in agricultural science and technology have led to more precise
    methods for monitoring and managing fruit maturation and ripening (Lino et al.
    2008). Techniques like spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and smart sensing
    devices provide real-time data on fruit quality parameters, enabling better harvesting
    decisions and reducing food waste. Additionally, research on post-harvest treatments,
    such as controlled atmosphere storage and ethylene regulation, is continually
    improving to prolong fruit shelf life and enhance consumer satisfaction. The ongoing
    efforts in understanding and optimizing the maturation and ripening processes
    in fruits are crucial in ensuring a steady supply of high-quality, flavorful,
    and nutritious produce to meet the demands of the ever-growing global population.
    Overall, biosensors have become invaluable tools in the fruit industry, providing
    growers, producers, and consumers with valuable information to ensure the delivery
    of high-quality, flavorful, and nutritious fruits while minimizing food waste
    and optimizing the fruit supply chain. As technology continues to evolve, biosensors
    are expected to play an increasingly significant role in fruit maturity assessment,
    contributing to a more sustainable and efficient agricultural ecosystem. Electronic
    Nose (E-Nose) and Electronic Tongue (E-Tongue) The use of E-Nose technology has
    revolutionized various aspects of the fruit industry, including grading, sorting,
    determining the timing of fruit harvest, transportation, storage handling, and
    final selection. By characterizing aromatic compounds, E-Nose provides valuable
    insights into the quality and ripeness of fruits (Beghi et al. 2017; Liu et al.
    2020). E-Nose utilizes different types of gas sensors, with four commonly employed
    in commercial applications: Metal oxide semiconductors (MOS), Metal oxide semiconductor
    field-effect transistors (MOSFET), Conducting organic polymers (CP), and piezoelectric
    and Quartz crystals microbalance (QCM) (Table 4). Table 4 Application of E-nose
    in fruits and vegetables maturity Full size table An electronic nose consists
    of several key components: a) a sample delivery system, b) sensor arrays, c) a
    signal processing unit, d) an information processing unit, e) software with analytical
    algorithms, and f) a reference-library database. The sample can be delivered through
    an automated or flow-based system, which may include sample concentration modulation
    (Electronic Nose 2019). The sensor array is composed of various sensors that respond
    to different chemical classes across a wide range, enabling them to distinguish
    between different combinations of potential analytes. These sensors carry chemical-sensitive
    layers, chosen based on the type of samples being analyzed. The signals from the
    sensor array undergo various processing operations, including offset subtraction,
    concentration modulation by time, signal ratioing between sensors, signal averaging
    for noise compensation, signal normalization to account for aging effects, and
    range compression of sensory input. Through these processes, the outputs are collected
    and combined to create a distinctive digital response pattern, which is then recognized
    through its distinct aroma signature for identification and categorization. Before
    analyzing the sample, a reference digital library is used to create aroma signature
    patterns for known samples. The detection of odors relies on identifying unknowns
    based on their aroma attribute patterns that exhibit similarities with pattern
    databases in the reference library (Beghi et al. 2017). The continuous advancements
    in E-Nose technology and its integration with artificial intelligence and machine
    learning algorithms have expanded its capabilities and applications in the fruit
    industry. As research progresses, E-Nose is expected to play an increasingly significant
    role in optimizing fruit quality assessment, supply chain management, and overall
    consumer satisfaction. By harnessing the power of electronic noses, the fruit
    industry is poised for greater efficiency, reduced waste, and improved fruit quality
    throughout the entire value chain. E-Tongue imitates human tongue by using a variety
    of sensors to react the taste characteristics such as salty, sweet, sour, bitter
    and umami and then send signals through computer for elucidation, the mostly used
    sensors are voltametric and potentiometric, this hybrid technology combines both
    methods shown in Fig. 9 (Liu et al. 2020). E-Tongue widely used for beer fermentation
    analysis, milk fermentation, in meat industry to determine the amount of curing
    agents. This makes better and efficient sensory analysis gives output corelating
    the sensorial analysis by experts and consumer preferences. In determining the
    ripening stage, e-nose as well as comparing the variations between the cultivars,
    and the work based on the maturity levels cluster analysis is applied to measure
    their maturity indices (TA, total soluble solids, and color) (Liu et al. 2020).
    Fig. 9 Schematic diagram of E-Tongue.  (Source: Liu et al. 2020) Full size image
    The E-nose has found effective application in monitoring changes in aroma during
    the ripening process of climacteric fruits like apple (Brezmes et al. 2000; Saevels
    et al. 2003; Pathange et al. 2006), peach (Brezmes et al. 2000; Di Natale et al.
    2001a, b and 2002; Infante et al. 2011; Zhang et al. in 2012), mango (Lebrun et
    al. 2008; Zakaria et al. 2011), pear (Brezmes et al. 2000), apricot (Parpinello
    et al. 2007), and tomato (Gómez et al. 2006a). However, there is limited information
    available regarding the application of the E-nose on non-climacteric fruits like
    cherry (Benedetti et al. 2010), mandarin (Gómez et al. 2006b; Qiu and Wang 2015),
    and orange (Qiu and Wang 2015). Additionally, some literature has also utilized
    the E-nose for purposes of cultivar discrimination and classification (Beghi et
    al. 2017). To enhance selectivity and increase the detection limits of target
    molecules, employing different types of sensing elements in the sensor array proves
    advantageous. Hu et al. (2013) have pioneered a method to incorporate an array
    of single nanowires (NWs), including materials like polyaniline (PANI), palladium
    (Pd), polypyrrole (PPy), and zinc oxide (ZnO), representing metal, metal oxide,
    and conducting polymer categories, onto a single chip. This involved cutting a
    4-inch wafer with patterned electrodes and nanochannels into smaller slices, with
    four distinct single nanowires grown onto electrochem-chips using varying electrolyte
    solutions. A probe station equipped with three probes facilitated direct contact
    with the electrodes. The growth of Pd, PPy, and PANI single nanowires occurred
    through electrochemical deposition, while ZnO nanowire growth involved electrochemical
    deposition followed by a hydrothermal treatment. The chip containing these four
    distinct single nanowires underwent rinsing in DI water and subsequent drying
    before stabilization. This innovative nanowire array on a single chip has demonstrated
    its efficacy in detecting and identifying four target gases, including hydrogen,
    methanol, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. One notable limitation is the
    limited application of E-Nose technology on non-climacteric fruits like cherry,
    mandarin, and orange, indicating potential challenges in effectively assessing
    aroma changes in these fruit types due to differences in volatile organic compounds.
    Additionally, there is a need to enhance the selectivity of E-Nose technology,
    particularly in terms of distinguishing between specific target molecules and
    reducing cross-sensitivity issues. The complexity of developing sensor arrays
    with multiple sensing elements, such as nanowires made of different materials,
    poses manufacturing and maintenance challenges. Looking ahead, future research
    directions should aim to expand the application of E-Nose technology to non-climacteric
    fruits, broadening its utility in the fruit industry. Enhancing selectivity remains
    a critical goal, which may involve the development of more specialized sensor
    arrays or advanced data analysis techniques. Researchers could also explore ways
    to simplify sensor arrays without compromising accuracy. The integration of E-Nose
    technology with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms offers
    potential for more advanced and automated applications. Furthermore, efforts to
    expand the range of gases and compounds that E-Nose technology can detect and
    identify could open up new applications across various industries, extending its
    impact beyond fruit quality assessment. In summary, addressing limitations and
    exploring innovative directions are crucial for the continued growth and effectiveness
    of E-Nose technology in the future. Nanosensor Nanotechnology and nanoscale materials
    represent innovative and burgeoning fields of research. Nanoparticles, owing to
    their minuscule size and exceptional properties, hold vast potential for the development
    of novel devices with unprecedented applications in diverse fields, including
    optics, mechanics, pharmaceuticals, and food safety (Rabbani et al. 2020). Nanosensors,
    in particular, have emerged as indispensable tools, enhancing health, environmental
    quality control, and numerous global applications. These sensors extend their
    utility beyond medicine and pharmaceuticals, proving invaluable in the realm of
    food safety and security. Conventional methods often suffer from time constraints
    and high costs, making the development of nanosensors a game-changing advancement.
    Many such sensors have been created with a focus on cost-effectiveness and scalability,
    improving agricultural efficiency, soil quality, food processing, packaging, food
    shelf life, and pathogen analysis (Ansari et al. 2023). For instance, Sarkar et
    al. (2020) engineered a ZnO Nanostructured ethylene gas sensor, a critical indicator
    of fruit ripening. Their optimized sensor exhibited heightened sensitivity, promising
    significant benefits in ethylene gas detection during fruit ripening, thereby
    enhancing quality control and reducing food wastage. Similarly, Fahim et al. (2020)
    crafted a chitosan-graphene nanocomposite-based sensor with varying concentrations,
    manifesting unique gas-sensing capabilities through both mechanical and electrical
    means. Additionally, Dalal et al. (2017) developed a nanosensor to detect malic
    acid in tomatoes, a marker of ripeness. They immobilized malic enzyme on a carboxylated-multiwall
    carbon nanotubes electrode, characterizing it through SEM and FTIR analysis. Their
    study underscored the nanosensor''s rapid and accurate potential in determining
    tomato ripeness by detecting malic acid levels. The pre-determination of fruit
    maturity holds paramount importance, offering crucial insights into harvesting
    and selling priorities and preservation conditions. In this context, nanotechnology
    demonstrates promising potential, enabling precise and timely maturity assessment.
    This technology stands to significantly impact agricultural practices and market
    outcomes, offering the advantage of efficiency and accuracy. However, it''s essential
    to consider potential disadvantages such as the need for specialized equipment
    and expertise, as well as the cost of implementing nanotechnology-based solutions.
    Looking ahead, the future scope of nanosensors in agriculture and food safety
    is vast, with potential advancements in scalability, cost-effectiveness, and broader
    adoption in the food industry. Further research and development in this field
    will continue to drive innovation and improve the sustainability of agricultural
    practices worldwide. Freshness sensors Fruit ripeness, firmness, and freshness
    are essential parameters monitored by freshness sensors or indicators, providing
    valuable insights into the quality of fruits. Conversely, smart sensors or smart
    packaging systems encompass embedded electronic components alongside electrochemical
    or electro-optical sensors strategically placed in close proximity to packaged
    fruits (Gómez et al. 2006; Kuswandi et al. 2013). These systems facilitate continuous
    monitoring of fruit quality, beginning from the moment the shipment leaves the
    processing plant until it reaches consumers, as depicted in Fig. 10. It is worth
    noting that the efficacy of fruit freshness sensors is contingent on the specific
    fruit type and its distinctive physiological attributes (Alam et al. 2021). Consequently,
    understanding the physiology of the fruit is imperative in the development and
    implementation of freshness sensors and smart packaging systems, as elaborated
    in the following sections. Fig. 10 Illustration of smart food packaging system.  (Source:
    Alam et al. 2021) Full size image Freshness sensors can be broadly classified
    into two categories: direct sensors and indirect sensors. Direct freshness sensors
    directly detect specific analytes present in the fruit, serving as direct indicators
    of food freshness (Kuswandi et al. 2013). In contrast, indirect freshness sensors
    operate by detecting signs of fruit deterioration attributed to freshness factors,
    such as temperature and/or time (El-Ramady et al. 2015). These sensors are meticulously
    designed to monitor various stages within the food distribution chain, including
    consumer packages displayed on store shelves. Importantly, these sensors must
    accurately gauge the rate of fruit freshness deterioration (Alam et al. 2021).
    The design and functionality of freshness sensors vary based on the specific monitoring
    stage within the food distribution chain or the consumer package on the shelf.
    Regardless of the stage, these sensors must effectively track the degradation
    rate of fruit freshness (Beshai et al. 2020). A diverse array of concepts for
    fruit freshness sensors or indicators has been developed, encompassing parameters
    such as aldehyde (Kim et al. 2018, Vo et al. 2007), volatile organic compounds
    (VOC) (Mustafa et al. 2018), ethanol (Boerman et al. 2016), hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
    (Hu et al. 2012), pH (Guo et al. 2007b, Park et al. 2019), and CO2 (de Almeida
    Teixeira et al. 2018). These sensors or indicators are seamlessly integrated into
    food packaging as visible indicators, labels, or tags, undergoing discernible
    color changes in response to variations in freshness markers and/or analytes.
    Freshness sensors can be configured as single sensors, dual sensors, or multiple
    sensor arrays. The majority of commercially available freshness sensors employ
    a single sensor, enabling monitoring of a single freshness parameter at a time,
    such as pH or time–temperature. Dual freshness sensors utilize two sensors that
    reference each other during the sensing process while simultaneously providing
    insights into food freshness. Moreover, dual and multiple sensor array configurations
    are currently under development in laboratory settings and are expected to be
    introduced to the market soon. Figure 11 illustrates various types of fruit freshness
    sensors based on both direct and indirect sensing methods. Fig. 11 Classifications
    of sensors for monitoring freshness of fruits.  (Source: Alam et al. 2021) Full
    size image Direct fruit freshness sensors have the capability to detect and assess
    the freshness level of fruits based on distinctive markers or compounds. Traditional
    forms of direct fruit freshness sensors encompass indicators for spoilage, ripeness,
    leakage, microbial pathogens, ethylene, and senescence. These sensors often incorporate
    a color indicator for straightforward visual assessment of freshness levels by
    the naked eye. The indicator undergoes a color change, and the rate of this change
    corresponds to the rate of food deterioration, which is closely linked to temperature
    fluctuations and time elapsed during food distribution cycles and shelf storage
    (Kuswandi et al. 2017). Direct freshness (Ripeness detecting sensors) Ripeness,
    a crucial factor in assessing fruit freshness, often presents a challenge for
    consumers in their estimation. This predicament frequently leaves customers uncertain
    about the optimal time to purchase, store, or consume fruits. To address this
    issue, several commercial ripeness indicators have been developed, offering practical
    solutions. Notably, ripeSenseTM, a company based in New Zealand, has introduced
    a promising approach (https://product.statnano.com/product/6730/ripesense). Their
    sensor responds to the aromatic cues emitted by ripening fruit, undergoing a color
    transformation from red (crisp) to orange (firm) and eventually to yellow (juicy)
    as the fruit ripens further. Consumers can easily gauge the fruit''s ripeness
    state by simply observing the color of the sensor, facilitating informed decisions.
    Moreover, the utilization of such sensors can potentially mitigate fruit damage
    and shrinkage resulting from consumer handling and inspection. These sensors are
    typically housed in recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) clamshell packaging,
    aligning with the trend toward more hygienic and environmentally conscious packaging
    solutions. ripeSenseTM sensors effectively monitor the ripeness of various fruits,
    including pears, kiwifruit, melons, mangoes, and avocados. Furthermore, different
    stages of fruit ripening may release volatile compounds, a phenomenon studied
    using electronic noses (e-noses). For instance, e-noses have been employed to
    assess the ripeness of tomatoes (Gómez et al. 2006). In another study, a straightforward,
    cost-effective, on-package color indicator was developed using methyl red (MR)
    for the detection of ripeness in non-climacteric fruits, such as strawberries
    (Kuswandi et al. 2013). In this case, an increase in pH in the package headspace
    triggered the release of volatile acids, gradually diminishing the presence of
    MR immobilized onto a bacterial cellulose membrane. This enzymatic process resulted
    in the formation of esters during ripening, causing the indicator''s color to
    transition from yellow to red–purple, signifying over-ripeness. A high correlation
    was observed between the color changes and strawberry ripeness levels. Consequently,
    real-time ripeness monitoring of strawberries was effectively demonstrated using
    this on-package color indicator, applicable in both ambient and refrigeration
    conditions. Ripeness sensors offer several advantages, including the provision
    of real-time data on fruit quality, assisting in timely decisions for harvesting,
    packaging, and distribution. This helps reduce food waste and ensures consumers
    receive high-quality produce. The integration of these sensors into smart packaging
    systems allows for precise monitoring and control of fruit storage and transportation
    conditions. However, limitations exist, including variations in sensor effectiveness
    based on fruit type, necessitating customization for specific varieties. Calibration
    and maintenance are vital for sustained accuracy, and cost considerations may
    limit adoption, especially for small-scale growers and producers. Future developments
    aim to enhance sensor accuracy and versatility, with advancements in multi-sensor
    arrays holding potential for improved fruit quality assessment. Efforts to reduce
    sensor costs may increase accessibility. Overall, ripeness sensors continue to
    evolve, contributing to the enhancement of fruit production and distribution (Alam
    et al. 2021). Indirect freshness The indirect assessment of fruit freshness relies
    on using indirect freshness indicators like temperature, storage duration, and
    technologies such as RFID (radio frequency identification). These indirect freshness
    sensors mimic the alterations in specific quality parameters of food when subjected
    to the same conditions as the indirect freshness indicators (Kuswandi et al. 2013).
    The rate of change in these sensors should correspond to the rate of degradation
    in the packaged food due to fluctuations in temperature and humidity during transportation,
    distribution, and storage over time. These indirect sensors should provide indications
    of freshness by means of alterations in color and electronic signal output when
    exposed to abnormal storage temperatures and/or humidity levels (Mahajan et al.
    2014). Humidity sensor A capacitive humidity sensor, a type of hygrometer, relies
    on changes in capacitance to gauge relative humidity levels. This sensor consists
    of a pair of slender metal surfaces or electrodes separated by a dielectric material
    film, typically a metal oxide (as depicted in Fig. 12). These electrodes form
    a parallel plate capacitor with a specific capacitance value. As the moisture
    content in the surrounding air varies, the permittivity of the dielectric film
    also undergoes changes. These alterations result in fluctuations in capacitance
    between the two electrodes. The shift in capacitance generates a noticeable analog
    voltage difference across the electrodes, which can be quantified and employed
    to ascertain the relative humidity level in the environment (Alam et al. 2021).
    These sensing devices are designed to operate within a temperature range of -20
    °C to 85 °C, encompassing the temperature fluctuations encountered during fruit
    transportation and storage (https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDA-00972). Fig. 12 Working
    principle for a capacitive humidity sensor. A The initial setup of the capacitive
    sensor indicating no detectable voltage across the plates. B The introduction
    of water vapor in the atmosphere. (C) The change in the permittivity of the dielectric
    because of the water vapor, generating a detectable voltage across the plates.  (Source:
    Alam et al. 2021) Full size image While capacitive humidity sensors offer an extensive
    range and are among the most accurate humidity sensors available, they come with
    certain drawbacks. They are relatively costly and may experience long-term stability
    issues. Consequently, it is crucial to recalibrate or replace these sensors when
    they approach their recommended operational lifespan, particularly when they are
    reused for different batches of produce during transportation and packaging (Liu
    and Zhang 2021). Furthermore, the performance of capacitive humidity sensors can
    be constrained by challenges related to saturation, hysteresis, or prolonged exposure
    to high humidity conditions (Lamberty and Kreyenschmidt 2022). In addition to
    their benefits, capacitive humidity sensors do have drawbacks. They can be relatively
    expensive and may suffer from long-term stability problems, necessitating recalibration
    or replacement after a certain lifespan, especially when used for various batches
    of produce during transportation and packaging. Furthermore, these sensors may
    face limitations related to saturation, hysteresis, or extended exposure to high
    humidity conditions, which can affect their accuracy and performance (Lamberty
    and Kreyenschmidt 2022). Looking toward the future, there is potential for advancements
    in capacitive humidity sensor technology. Researchers and engineers are actively
    working on improving the long-term stability of these sensors and addressing issues
    related to saturation and hysteresis. Additionally, efforts are underway to make
    these sensors more cost-effective, which could broaden their applications in various
    industries, including the monitoring of fruit transportation and storage. As technology
    evolves, capacitive humidity sensors are likely to become more reliable and accessible
    tools for ensuring the quality and freshness of fruits and other products during
    their journey from farm to table. Time–temperature indicators (TTIs) It serve
    as indirect freshness sensors that operate through various chemical, physical,
    and biological mechanisms (Maschietti 2010). Chemical and physical mechanisms
    involve reactions or changes influenced by alterations in time and temperature,
    such as acid–base reactions, melting, and polymerization. Biological mechanisms
    are linked to shifts in biological activity, including microorganisms, spores,
    or enzymes, in response to changes in time and temperature. TTIs primarily rely
    on color changes when exposed to temperatures beyond recommended storage conditions
    for extended periods, indicating alterations as the product approaches the end
    of its shelf life. Consequently, TTIs offer a means to monitor the physical, chemical,
    and biological attributes of fruits, providing precise indications of freshness
    in terms of quality, safety, and shelf life. Irrespective of the detection method,
    essential specifications for TTI datasheets encompass threshold temperatures and
    runout times. Threshold temperatures specify the indicator''s operational range,
    defining the maximum and minimum temperatures required to trigger recording. Runout
    time represents the minimum duration at a temperature outside the operating range
    necessary for the entire indicator to change color. While TTIs provide reasonably
    accurate estimates of exposure to unfavorable temperatures, they are not as precise
    as conventional temperature sensors. However, their straightforward operation,
    user-friendliness, and suitability for commercial fruit smart packaging systems
    make them an ideal choice (https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~{}/MONMARK-3M-MonitorMark-Time-Temperature-Indicators/?N=5002385+3293785721&rt=rud).
    Numerous commercial TTIs have been developed and are widely utilized for monitoring
    perishable goods, including fruits. Examples of such TTIs include Fresh-Check®,
    Monitor MarkTM, OnVuTM, eO®, Timestrip®, Checkpoint®, and Tempix® (Beshai et al.
    2020). These commercial indicators primarily rely on chemical and enzymatic reactions
    and are frequently applicable to fruit packaging. For instance, Fresh-Check® is
    a self-adhesive chemical indicator based on polymerization, exhibiting a visual
    color change and providing a full history of temperature exposure. Monitor MarkTM,
    on the other hand, is a partial-history TTI that offers temperature vs. time history
    through the diffusion of blue-dyed fatty acid esters. The OnVuTM indicator operates
    on a photochemical reaction principle, signaling exposure to elevated temperatures
    over time. eO® is a microbial-based TTI that changes color in response to variations
    in the pH of deteriorating food products. Timestrip® functions on diffusion, where
    dye melting and migration occur through the porous membrane when temperatures
    exceed the reference temperature. Checkpoint® indicator operates through enzymatic
    reactions, resulting in color changes. Tempix® is another diffusion-based TTI
    where activation liquid diffuses into a barcode in the event of temperature breaches.
    Due to their diverse mechanisms, commercial TTIs can be effectively used for assessing
    the freshness of various fruit types based on their specific degradation mechanisms
    and time–temperature breaches (Alam et al. 2021). Ethylene detecting sensors Ethylene
    is released by fruits to initiate respiration, which generates energy for internal
    biochemical processes. As this process continues, the plant''s flavour, texture,
    and nutrition change; as a result, a continual respiration rate can cause this
    same fruit to ripen quickly and eventually decline. After harvest, some fruits
    do not ripen; instead, they enter the senescence stage. Due to their climacteric
    property, bananas, for example, are exceedingly sensitive to outside ethylene.
    To avoid the fast, this same quantity of ethylene now must obviously be monitored.
    It is obvious that the amount of ethylene present must be monitored in order to
    avoid fruit''s rapid decomposition (Iqbal et al. 2017). Consequently, ethylene
    is commercially used in storage facilities to control fruit ripening. Fruits at
    different stages of ripening stored close together may also have a limited lifetime
    due to ethylene excretion from fresh fruits. Thus, ethylene scavenging and monitoring
    are strongly recommended to preserve fruit freshness. Ethanol scavenging helps
    to reduce fruit product loss due to ethylene overproduction. Potassium permanganate
    (KMnO4) is a common ethylene scavenger that oxidises ethylene to ethylene glycol.
    Moreover, ethylene glycol can be oxidised further to CO2 and H2O, resulting in
    dark brown MnO2. Granules of KMnO4 on clay particles or activated carbon Low temperature
    oxidation above a platinum catalyst (Vermeiren et al. 1999) is a commercial ethylene
    scavenger at 0 °C on mesoporous silica capable of removing 50 ppm ethylene. Another
    study measured the amount of ethylene gas released by using the metal organic
    framework base, fruits were measured, possess an olefin detector. An electrochemical
    ethylene sensor was created using a semiconductor electrode made of C60 and zeolite.
    It is built to track the ethylene gas for a variety of concentrations in order
    to describe how a fruit ripens and a new gas sensor was made that looked at various
    signal patterns created using the graphite line patterning technique this created
    sensors are an economical way to track the fruit ripening was additionally observed
    without causing damage, using E-nose was employed to gauge the evolution of ethylene
    a sensor for chemicals array built on TiO2 was introduced. Infrared thermal emission
    techniques are also used to develop an ethylene sensing device. A high-sensitivity
    silicon temperature detector was connected to an infrared heat source adjusted
    to the 10.6 m wavelength. The 10.6 μm IR waves were absorbed by the addition of
    ethylene into the wave path between the IR source and temperature detector, which
    also lowered the surface temperature of the detector. The output was next transformed
    into an electrical signal (in mV) that provided a precise measurement of the amount
    of ethylene. These sensors may be used for fruit ripening applications on site
    and in field as well as fruit screening (Kathirvelan and Vijayaraghavan 2017).
    The sensor works on the principle of resistance variation in the presence or absence
    of analyte. The TiO2-WO3 dispersion was transformed into a gel using the sol–gel
    technique, which was applied to the substrate''s surface and implanted with gold
    electrodes using a brush coating technique. When fruit interacts with the constructed
    sensor, ethylene is produced, is oxidised into ethylene oxide, and subsequently
    releases electrons and re-enters the sensor element, resulting in a reduction
    in resistance. Because the reactions are reversible, the created sensor has a
    higher sensitivity and may be reused. The manufactured sensor was reasonably priced,
    and its baseline resistance changed less over time (Kathirvelan et al. 2017).
    Carbon dioxide non-dispersive infrared sensor Modified consumer packaging, which
    alters the atmospheric conditions, plays a crucial role in ensuring the freshness
    and quality of fruits. By maintaining higher carbon dioxide levels and reducing
    oxygen levels, packaging creates an environment that slows down respiration, controls
    ripening, and prevents premature decay (Esser et al. 2012). However, excessive
    reduction in oxygen levels can lead to cell death and accelerate decay. To maintain
    the appropriate packaging conditions, NDIR sensors are employed to monitor atmospheric
    gases effectively (Fig. 13). NDIR sensors utilize infrared light absorption to
    quantify specific gases present in the atmosphere. The sensor emits a beam of
    light with wavelengths between 700 nm to 1 μm, passing through the target gas-containing
    air to an optical detector. Atmospheric gases selectively absorb certain wavelengths
    of light while allowing others to pass through unaffected. The amount of light
    absorbed or transmitted is measured by the optical detector, and this data is
    used to determine the quantity of specific gases present in the atmosphere (https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/6010192-how-does-an-ndir-co2-sensor-work).
    Fig. 13 Setup of the NDIR sensor. The infrared (IR) light with a wavelength of
    700 nm to 1 μm is partially absorbed by carbon dioxide and partially transmitted
    through to the detector.  (Source: Alam et al. 2021) Full size image In smart
    packaging systems for fruits, carbon dioxide is a crucial target gas used to control
    the atmosphere''s composition during the transportation and storage of produce.
    When the packaging seal is broken, external oxygen seeps in, and carbon dioxide
    disperses, accelerating the fruit''s ripening process. NDIR sensors, operating
    at 4300 nm infrared wavelength, easily detect carbon dioxide, as it does not interfere
    with oxygen absorption (Vanderroost et al. 2014). In fruit packaging, the measuring
    range, accuracy, and precision of NDIR sensors are essential considerations. The
    measuring range indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air that the
    sensor can detect. Standard NDIR sensors can detect a range of 0–20 percent carbon
    dioxide gas with an accuracy of approximately ± 0.5% and a sensitivity of about
    0.05%. These sensors offer long lifespans, allowing for reuse in multiple fruit
    shipments and requiring minimal maintenance. However, there is a risk of external
    spectroscopic interference affecting the optical detector, leading to inaccurate
    light detection. The use of optical filters can mitigate this issue (Dinh et al.
    2016). NDIR sensing is particularly suitable for system-level smart packaging,
    where the sensor is placed outside the food package and provides feedback to system
    actuators to optimize storage conditions. This technology''s advantages lie in
    its ability to create an environment that prolongs fruit freshness, enhances shelf
    life, and reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable packaging solutions
    for the fruit industry. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based sensor system
    The focus of most sensing systems discussed earlier is on assessing the quality
    of fruits or fruit products. However, valuable information can also be gathered
    from the containers used to store citrus fruits. Active packaging utilizing RFID
    technology can monitor and identify product quality during storage and transportation
    in containers. RFID tags, similar to electronic barcodes, are affixed to pre-packed
    units and store data that can be accessed later through a network as required.
    These systems consist of an RFID tag with an antenna, an RFID scanner, and radio
    waves to communicate data to a network. The tag contains an integrated circuit
    and an antenna enclosed in a protective covering. When scanned, the RFID tag transmits
    package information to the reader via the antenna, and the receiver converts the
    radio waves emitted by the tag into the appropriate data format (Alam et al. 2021).
    These RFID scanners can function independently or in conjunction with a central
    network for storing, processing, and distributing data. For instance, in refrigerated
    fruit storage, wireless sensing technologies like RFID and wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) were used to monitor temperature and humidity. The combination of RFID and
    WSN devices in commercial wholesale chambers enabled the creation of 3D temperature
    maps and psychrometric simulation models to calculate changes in latent heat and
    absolute water content in the air. By utilizing RFID and WSN sensor networks,
    energy consumption in cold storage, water loss from products, and the detection
    of water condensation on stored commodities could be estimated (Badia-Melis et
    al. 2015). One of the significant advantages of RFID technology is its ease of
    detection on carrier containers or storage shelves. The reading range of RFID
    can be adjusted based on the operation frequency and power supply transmission
    line unit, making it more flexible than traditional barcode technology, that requires
    a clear line of sight and proper orientation for reading. Moreover, RFID scanners
    can read multiple tags simultaneously, allowing for efficient scanning of single
    containers or bulk quantities. As this technology continues to evolve, the future
    scope includes further improvements in accuracy, range, and integration with smart
    packaging systems, enhancing the monitoring and control of fruit storage and transportation,
    ultimately reducing food waste and ensuring better product quality for consumers.
    A study was performed to detect the freshness of vegetables focusing on oxygen
    and carbon dioxide concentration in which a monitoring system based on an RFID
    tag was developed. The criteria behind the development of the sensor was that
    the concentrations of these two gases are related to freshness and affect the
    food. The RFID system can be comparatively managed easily. The used sensors were
    programmed accordingly to the use, and the RFID tag was prepared. The prepared
    tags kept inside the vegetable packets and study was carried out at several days
    to check the concentration of both the gases and to determine the freshness level.
    However, this research is still in the initial stages, where only two gases were
    detected. Further motivation is to develop the smart RFID tag and to produce more
    precise data on the freshness of fruit and vegetables (Eom et al. 2012). To address
    the problems of fruits and vegetable freshness, a sensor was developed which works
    with the principle of measurement of change in ion concentration in fruit and
    vegetables. The prototype was composed of four different circuits, such as processor
    supply circuit, liquid crystal display circuits, the measurement circuit. These
    circuits were designed by using a circuit design program called Dip Trace after
    the test was done manually by using circuit test boards. Notably, the measurement
    circuit was designed using sensitive and low tolerated resistors to increase the
    sensitivity of performed measurements. Three different critical intervals were
    chosen for each sample to determine their freshness. By stabbing these electrodes
    to sample freshness measurement can be done by using information about the ion
    concentration of the sample. If the value is in the first interval, it means the
    sample is fresh, if the measurement result is in the second interval it means
    the sample is about to lose its freshness, and for the values, in the third interval
    the result will be written: “the sample is rotten and cannot be consumed”. This
    developed prototype was used for different fruit varieties such as citrus variety,
    apple, pear, and strawberries to determine the freshness, and it was observed
    that as the fruit decays, the ion concentration of the fruit gets decreased. The
    prototype was successfully applied in the initial measurement and is still required
    modification to make it advance (Kemiklioglu and Ozen 2018). Recently, polyvinyl
    alcohol and red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) extract based electrospun nanofiber
    mat was fabricated to analyze the pH. The nanofibers were subjected to pH sensitivity
    test applying a sequence of different pH solutions and using a colorimeter, the
    color spectrum of nanofiber mats were calibrated at different pH values. As per
    the results found, it could be said that the designed mat can be convenient as
    a pH sensor and show pH values within the range of 2–12. The color changes of
    the mat were reversible with respect to the change in the pH value, and thus the
    monitoring of transient changes could be performed efficaciously (Maftoonazad
    and Ramaswamy 2019). In conclusion, RFID technology offers numerous advantages
    in packaging applications, particularly in the context of fruit monitoring and
    logistics. RFID tags enable efficient inventory management through reader placement
    at storage entrances, offering simplicity in tag detection even within carrier
    containers or storage shelves. Their adjustable reading range, based on operation
    frequency and power supply, surpasses the limitations of traditional barcode technology,
    which demands line of sight and proper orientation for scanning. RFID scanners

    Introduction Plant leaf diseases decrease the efficiency of photosynthesis and
    seriously hinder the synthesis of organic matter and energy acquisition. It has
    become one of the main obstacles to achieving high yield and quality of crops.
    Meanwhile, various degrees of diseases impair the synthesis of nutrient proteins
    and result in yield reduction, reducing the economic efficiency of crops1. Traditional
    plant leaf disease identification mainly relies on the experience accumulated
    by generations of researchers in the plant production process, which requires
    a high level of professional knowledge for plant producers. However, discriminating
    plant leaf diseases by eyes has high subjectivity and is prone to errors, thus
    hindering the timely treatment of plants2,3. Therefore, for today’s agricultural
    production, it is necessary to develop a new system to liberate producers from
    the inefficient and complex process of plant leaf disease identification. Due
    to artificial intelligence’s rapid development, image processing and deep learning
    techniques are becoming increasingly mature. The application of deep learning
    technology4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 to identifying plant leaf diseases intelligently has
    become a prominent trend, which helps to overcome the defects of traditional methods
    to improve plant yields12. Considering the above issues, a new plant disease classification
    network is proposed in this paper to improve identification accuracy and efficiency.
    Meanwhile, a plant leaf disease identification application (APP) is presented
    to assist in identifying plant leaf diseases, thereby maximizing yields and ensuring
    sustainable agricultural development. To extract discriminative features for leaf
    disease classification, three different neural network blocks-the bidirectional
    information fusion block (BIF-Block), the adaptive channel attention block (ACA-Block),
    and the channel expansion residual block (CER-Block)-are specifically employed.
    Among them, the CER-Block adopts three pooling windows of different sizes and
    a residual structure to expand the model’s receptive field and output channels
    while maintaining a lower computational burden. The ACA-Block introduces an adaptive
    size distribution function with a reverse Gaussian probability density function
    into the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)13, enabling the model to
    focus on critical regions and channels containing leaf disease information. The
    BIF-Block establishes a bidirectional information pipeline among multi-level features
    to extract fine-grained information between multi-level features, thereby improving
    the robustness and accuracy of the network. The main contributions of this work
    are summarized as follows: A novel ERCP-Net is proposed based on deep learning
    techniques, which effectively combines CER-Block, ACA-Block, and BIF-Block to
    achieve automatic recognition of plant leaf diseases. A convenient plant leaf
    disease identification APP is developed, which is equipped with a trained model
    and supports photographing, uploading, identification, and information feedback
    of plant leaves in real scenarios. The experimental results indicate that the
    proposed ERCP-Net achieved recognition accuracy of 99.82% and 86.21%, outperforming
    other state-of-the-art methods. The rest of this paper is outlined as follows:

    disease identification Although deep learning networks such as VGG14, ResNet15,
    DenseNet16, and Efficientnet17, perform well in traditional classification tasks,
    they are not suitable for plant leaf disease recognition. He et al.4 proposed
    an end-to-end bilinear residual structure that can extract finer-grained features
    on plant leaf spots. Brahimiet al.5 identified tomato leaf disease images by using
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained on a dataset containing 14828
    images of tomato leaves infected with nine diseases. Soujanya et al.6 used deep
    learning techniques to classify plant diseases and proposed a method to reduce
    the number of parameters and computational cost by adding an inverse convolution
    layer to the traditional AlexNet. The method achieved the best accuracy of 96.50\\(\\%\\).
    Singh et al.7 developed a multilayer CNN for classifying mango anthracnose leaves,
    and the proposed model obtains higher classification accuracy for mango anthracnose
    than other methods. Hussain et al.8 constructed a deep learning framework based
    on optimal feature selection for identifying multiple classes of foliar diseases
    of cucumber. Akram et al.18 added a low-pass output to the Retinex model for dataset
    preprocessing to improve the detection of small targets. Moreover, a classification
    method was developed based on the deep convolutional neural network to classify
    leaf diseases of five plants, and it obtained an accuracy of 97.80\\(\\%\\) on
    the PlantVillage dataset. Chen et al.19 extended VGG by applying transfer learning
    to the Inception module for pre-training, and the method achieved an accuracy
    of above 91.83\\(\\%\\) on the public dataset and 92.00\\(\\%\\) for the classification
    prediction of rice plant leaf disease images in complex contexts. Wang et al.20
    classified the images of the apple black spot PlantVillage dataset according to
    the degree of disease as healthy leaves, mild, moderate, and severe diseased leaves
    based on expert opinion. Meanwhile, the researchers compared four classification
    networks, including VGG16, VGG19, Inception-V3, and ResNet50, and they concluded
    that the fine-tuned VGG16 model performed best, with a classification accuracy
    of 90.40\\(\\%\\) on the test set of disease severity assessment. Chohan et al.21
    developed a plant leaf disease classification model based on CNNs, and the accuracy
    of the proposed model on the test set was 98.30\\(\\%\\). Akshai et al.22 trained
    three CNNs, including VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, on the PlantVillage dataset.
    The results showed that DenseNet performed the best on the test set with an accuracy
    of 98.27\\(\\%\\). Hassan et al.23 constructed a deep learning model using residual
    connectivity and deep separable convolution. This model achieved an accuracy of
    99.39\\(\\%\\) on the PlantVillage dataset. Atila et al.24 designed a modified
    EfficientNet model, which obtained an accuracy of 99.97\\(\\%\\) on the test set
    of the PlantVillage dataset. Attention mechanism techniques applied to plant leaf
    disease identification Limited by the local perceptual field problem of convolutional
    operations, traditional CNNs tend to obtain local optimal solutions, resulting
    in the loss of feature information. Therefore, attention mechanisms that can selectively
    focus on the feature information of interest have been widely studied. For the
    attention mechanism in CNN, visual attention is divided into channel attention
    and spatial attention by Niu et al.25. The most commonly used attention mechanisms
    are Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet)26 and CBAM27. Alirezazadeh et al.28
    embedded the improved CBAM into their model to achieve an accuracy of 86.89\\(\\%\\)
    on the test set of the public dataset DiaMOS29. Yang et al.30 proposed an attention
    mechanism with weighted feature information fusion for fine-grained classification
    of 37 types of plant leaf diseases. The proposed attention mechanism combined
    with transfer learning achieved an accuracy of 95.62\\(\\%\\) on the test set.
    Zhao et al.31 incorporated an improved CBAM into ResNet to reduce redundant information
    extracted from the convolutional layer. The proposed model achieved an accuracy
    of 97.59\\(\\%\\) on a dataset of 16 tomato leaf diseases. Zhao et al.32 enhanced
    the channel attention in the CBAM structure by replacing the Shared MLP (Multilayer
    Perceptron) with two one-dimensional convolutions and modifying the kernel size
    of the one-dimensional convolution based on prior knowledge. For a dataset containing
    images of corn, potatoes, and tomatoes from the PlantVillage dataset, the model
    obtained an accuracy of 99.55\\(\\%\\) on the test set. Based on the analysis
    of the existing research, this work proposes to use the residual and attention
    mechanism to further improve the classification of plant leaf diseases. Table
    1 summarizes the relevant research on the PlantVillage dataset. Table 1 Comparison
    of different obfuscations in terms of their transformation capabilities. Full
    size table Dataset processing The PlantVillage33 dataset used in this study is
    publicly available and authoritative. The PlantVillage does not represent real
    scenarios but lab conditions. This dataset includes leaf diseases of 14 types
    of plants with a total of 38 disease types. There are 54305 sample images in the
    dataset, and each image has three channels of R, G, and B. Fig. 1 shows some plant
    leaf disease images in the dataset. To improve the generalization and robustness
    of the model, this work adopts four methods for data enhancement, including random
    horizontal flip, random vertical flip, random rotation of the image angle between
    0 and 35 degrees, and the addition of Gaussian noise. The enhanced dataset has
    60371 sample images in total. The dataset was divided into a training set, a validation
    set, and a test set at a ratio of 6:2:2. In order to verify the performance of
    the model. There are 50,000 labeled images of crop leaves in the dataset used
    in the AI Challenger 2018. Ten plant species-apples, cherries, grapes, citrus,
    peaches, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, maize, and potatoes-as well as twenty-seven
    distinct illnesses are depicted in the pictures. With 61 categories in all, the
    data collection offers rich and varied samples for researching illnesses and pests.

    virus. Full size image Method This section introduces our proposed method and
    its variants in detail. First, the CER-Block is presented, which can extract image
    information accurately by combining the ideas of channel expansion and residuals.
    Based on the CER-Block, the ER-Net is constructed, which is a backbone network
    for plant leaf disease classification. Second, the ACA-Block is designed, which
    makes the backbone network focus more on leaf disease information to reduce redundant
    information interference. Also, as shown in Fig. 5, the ACA-Block is embedded
    into the backbone network to build a stronger ERC-Net. Finally, the BIF-Block
    is proposed to improve the classification results’ robustness. Finally, the state-of-the-art
    classification model ERCP-Net is established, as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 2 The
    structure of the CER-Block. “a\\(\\times\\)b” means window size. Note that the
    stride of each component defaults to 1. Full size image Figure 3 The framework
    of the ER-Net network. Full size image CER-Block and ER-Net Traditional image
    classification networks usually use convolutional operations for channels to scale,
    which can increase the number of parameters. As the network deepens, numerous
    training parameters will incur a large computational burden and cause gradient
    information disappearance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the channel
    expansion residual structure (CER-Block). The CER-Block consists of two components:
    an image feature information extraction layer and a residual connection layer.
    The image feature information extraction layer consists of three max-pooling layers
    with different window sizes (3\\(\\times\\)3, 5\\(\\times\\)5, and 9\\(\\times\\)9)
    and an information aggregation layer. This helps to expand the perceptual field
    while triple-expanding the number of channels without increasing the number of
    parameters. Then, the features obtained by max-pooling are fed to the information
    aggregation layer to make the network focus on leaf disease information from multiple
    perspectives. The information aggregation layer consists of three convolutions
    of different kernel sizes, i.e., 1, 3, and 1. The role of the convolution layer
    is to perform more abstract information aggregation from features. Moreover, the
    residual connection layer comprises a convolution with a kernel size of 1, and
    this layer is essentially an additive node. It combines the gradient information
    of the upper layer with the output information of the first part while preserving
    the original state of the gradient. During the gradient information propagation,
    the risk of gradient explosion or gradient disappearance in the network is reduced
    Fig. 2 illustrates the structure of the CER-Block. The backbone network ER-Net
    is constructed based on CER-Block. As shown in Fig. 3, the CER-Net comprises two
    down-sampling layers and three CER-Blocks. First, ER-Net receives the input images
    with a size of \\(416\\times 416\\) pixels. Then, the image is fed to a 7\\(\\times\\)7
    convolution layer with a stride of 2 and a max-pooling layer with a stride of
    2. In this way, meaningless spatial information is suppressed, and discriminative
    channel information is improved. Since plant leaf diseases are often represented
    as composite features such as color, texture, and shape, it is difficult for a
    simple convolutional layer to transform composite feature information from simple
    to abstract. Therefore, the feature map is fed to three cascaded CER-Blocks to
    learn different and complementary plant leaf disease information from the feature
    map, thereby enhancing the network’s disease recognition capability. Finally,
    the abstract feature information is input to the prediction layer to obtain the
    final classification results. Figure 4 The structure of the ACA-Block. Note that
    the kernel size of 1D convolution is determined by an inverse Gaussian probability
    density function, and the kernel size of 2D convolution is set to 7\\(\\times\\)7.
    Full size image ACA-Block and ERC-Net CBAM13 is a classical attention mechanism
    module that combines channel and spatial attention. This module can be easily
    embedded into the backbone network for image classification to obtain better results.
    Zhao et al.32 proposed an improved channel attention module based on CBAM by modifying
    the shared MLP in the original channel attention module into two 1D convolutions
    and manually setting the kernel size of the 1D convolution. Then, they conducted
    a mass variant experiment about the convolution kernel size to achieve the best
    performance. Since the manual setting of kernel size is time-consuming, subjective,
    and random, this work uses the inverse Gaussian probability density function to
    project the kernel size of the 1D convolution adaptively. Let the kernel size
    of the 1D convolution be x, and the number of channels of the feature map is y.
    Then, the original Gaussian probability density function is represented as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    y = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi }}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu )^2}{2\\sigma ^2}} \\end{aligned}$$
    (1) where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) is the variance. Moreover,
    the inverse Gaussian probability density function is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    x = \\sqrt{-2\\sigma ^2\\ln {(y\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi })}} + \\mu \\end{aligned}$$
    (2) where \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the variance.
    First, the inverse Gaussian probability density function is applied to the channel
    attention module. Then, a residual connection is introduced to combine the complete
    gradient information of the CER-Block with the output information of the attention
    module while preserving the original state of the gradient. Based on this, the
    ACA-Block is constructed. Note that x is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    Fig. 4 presents the framework of the proposed ACA-Block. Compared with the CBAM
    and BAM, our ACA-Block has three improvements. First, we use two 1D convolutions
    in the channel attention module to replace the original 2D convolution. The two
    one-dimensional convolutions are not downsampled, which can better prevent information
    loss in the feature map. Second, the size of the convolution kernel in the two
    one-dimensional convolutions is calculated by the inverse Gaussian probability
    density function (IGPDF). It is an adaptive size distribution function that can
    change with the size of the feature maps, making the feature maps have a stronger
    correlation after convolution. Third, we add a new residual structure. This structure
    ensures that the input gradient information can retain its original state after
    ACA-Block. A comparison of the formulae for calculating the feature map information
    for the CBAM, BAM, and ACA-Block is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} F''_{BAM}=
    & {} BN(MLP(AvgPool(F))) + M_{S} (F) \\end{aligned}$$ (3) $$\\begin{aligned} F''_{CBAM}=
    & {} \\sigma (MLP(AvgPool(F)) + MLP(MaxPool(F))) + M_{S} (F) \\end{aligned}$$
    (4) $$\\begin{aligned} F''_{ACA-Block}= & {} F + \\sigma (IGPDF(AvgPool(F)) +
    IGPDF(MaxPool(F))) + M_{S} (F) \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where \\(F''_{BAM}, F''_{CBAM},
    F''_{ACA-Block}\\) are the outputs of the BAM, the CBAM, and the ACA-Block, respectively.
    BN is batch-normalization. MLP is a multilayer perceptron consisting of two two-dimensional
    convolutions. \\(M_{S}(\\cdot )\\) is spatial attention. F is input information.
    IGPDF is the inverse Gaussian probability density function. AvgPool is average
    pooling. MaxPool is max pooling. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the ACA-Block is embedded
    behind each CER-Block to make the backbone network focus more on the information
    of the leaf disease part to reduce the interference of redundant information.
    Based on this, the ERC-Net network is constructed. Since the number of channels
    of the feature maps obtained by the three CER-Blocks in the ERC-Net network differs,
    the kernel size of the 1D convolution calculated by the inverse Gaussian probability
    density function is also different. Because of this, the attention module ACA-Block
    receives feature maps of different scales and with different numbers of channels.
    From the above two aspects, the ACA-Block can filter out redundant information,
    focus on leaf disease features, and further enhance the information correlation
    between feature maps to improve the accuracy of plant leaf disease classification.
    Figure 5 The framework of the ERC-Net network. Full size image Figure 6 The framework
    of the ERCP-Net network. Full size image ERCP-Net The traditional image classification
    network feeds the feature information extracted from top to bottom to the output
    layer to obtain the prediction results. Nevertheless, this output layer only focuses
    on the semantic information extracted from the deeper layers of the network. Meanwhile,
    it is difficult to focus on the pixel-level features of the image. To enable the
    classification network to focus on feature information from different aspects,
    this paper proposes a bidirectional information fusion block (BIF-Block) that
    incorporates feature map information from multiple perspectives. The improved
    output layer can focus on semantic and pixel-level information, thereby obtaining
    a robust prediction result. Fig. 6 illustrates the structure of the ERCP-Net network.
    Firstly, the traditional output layer of the ERC-Net network is removed. Secondly,
    the feature map information obtained from the third CER-Block+ACA-Block structure
    is upsampled and merged with the feature map information obtained from the second
    CER-Block+ACA-Block structure. The number of channels of the merged feature map
    is increased, i.e., deeper pixel information is added to the shallow semantic
    information. Then, the merged feature information is downsampled and merged again
    with the feature information obtained from the third CER-Block+ACA-Block structure
    to further enrich the semantic and pixel information. Finally, the final feature
    information is feedback to the output layer to obtain robust classification results.
    The output tensor dimensions for each layer of ERCP-Net are detailed in Table
    2. Table 2 The details of ERCP-Net and the tensor sizes of each output layer.

    the SGD optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function. The accuracy on the validation
    set is monitored during training, and the learning rate is decreased when the
    accuracy does not increase for three epochs  (Eq. 6). The detailed setting of
    the training parameters is listed Table 3. $$\\begin{aligned} LR = 0.3 \\times

    differences between the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods are
    compared to demonstrate the superiority of ERCP-Net in leaf disease spot recognition.
    Table 4 shows the accuracy of ERCP-Net and ten popular methods on the PlantVillage
    dataset. The results indicate that ERCP-Net achieves the best accuracy of 99.82%,
    surpassing the second-place by 0.27%. Although our result is lower than the first
    place, it may be related to the way the dataset is divided and enhanced. Meanwhile,
    the experimental results demonstrate that ERCP-Net performs better in leaf disease
    spot recognition than classical image classification networks, including VGG19,
    Inception-V3, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet50. On the PlantVillage dataset,
    Vo et al.34 also achieved an accuracy of 99.77% by combining EfficientNetB0 with
    MobileNetV2, Wang et al.35 achieved a 99.77% accuracy rate using the proposed
    methodology. Zhao et al.32 improved the CBAM structure of the channel attention
    by manually modifying the kernel size of the 1D convolution. The classification
    accuracy of the proposed model on the PlantVillage dataset is 99.55\\(\\%\\).
    The performance of our suggested model on AI challenger 2018 is displayed in Table
    5. As we can see, our model’s accuracy of 86.21% outperforms the widely used pest
    and disease classification methods now in use. Compared to these methods, our
    method performs the best. The experimental results indicate that using the inverse
    Gaussian probability density function to adaptively adjust the convolution kernel
    size is reliable and advantageous. Table 4 Comparison of ERCP-Net and state-of-the-art
    methods on the PlantVillage test set. Full size table Table 5 Performance comparison

    Comparison of model performance on the AI Challenger 2018 and PlantVillage datasets.
    Full size table Ablation and analysis To assess the effectiveness of the proposed
    modules and conduct a thorough analysis of our ERCP-Net, we performed ablation
    studies on two datasets: PlantVillage33 and AI Challenger 2018. Table 6 presents
    the performance of five model variants: ER-Net (#1), ER-Net-inceptionA (#2), ER-Net+CBAM
    (#3), ERC-Net (#4), and ERCP-Net (#5). To expand the channel number using deep
    learning techniques without increasing the parameter count, we propose the CER-Block.
    Utilizing this block, we first constructed the ER-Net (#1), a leaf disease spot
    classification network. Thanks to the CER-Block, ER-Net achieved accuracies of
    99.74% and 83.51\\(\\%\\) on the PlantVillage and AI Challenger 2018 benchmarks,
    respectively. Furthermore, we replaced the CER-Block with the Inception-A block
    from Inception v445 under identical experimental conditions. The introduction
    of the Inception-A block resulted in a decrease in accuracy, attributed to its
    inability to capture large-scale information and the loss of discriminative information
    through residual connections via the pooling layer. Then, the original CBAM13
    module is embedded into the ER-Net, and the accuracy of the model decreases to
    99.69\\(\\%\\) and 82.86\\(\\%\\), respectively. This is because some plant leaf
    diseases are affected by composite features such as color, texture, and shape,
    leading to a lower fit between the original CBAM and the ER-Net network. Subsequently,
    by embedding the original CBAM13 module into ER-Net, we observed a decrease in
    accuracy to 99.69% and 82.86% on the respective datasets. This decline is likely
    due to the inability of the original CBAM to adequately account for the composite
    features, such as color, texture, and shape, that characterize some plant leaf
    diseases, resulting in a suboptimal fit with the ER-Net network. To enhance the
    compatibility between CBAM and ER-Net, we improved the original CBAM and proposed
    the ACA-Block. Incorporating the ACA-Block, we developed ERC-Net, the second leaf
    disease spot classification network. ERC-Net showed improved accuracies of 99.76%
    and 85.12% on the PlantVillage and AI Challenger 2018 datasets, respectively.
    Additionally, ERC-Net demonstrated increased average precision and average recall
    rates of 83.26% and 82.12%, correspondingly, on the AI Challenger 2018 benchmark.
    Ultimately, by replacing the traditional output layer with the BIF-Block, we designed
    ERCP-Net. Leveraging the BIF-Block allows ERCP-Net to integrate multi-perspective
    feature information, focusing on both semantic and pixel-level details. Experimental
    results reveal that ERCP-Net outperforms all previous models, achieving accuracies
    of 99.82% and 86.21%, average precisions of 99.78% and 84.12%, and average recalls
    of 99.81% and 83.94% on the PlantVillage and AI Challenger 2018 benchmarks, respectively.
    These findings underscore ERCP-Net’s superior capability in addressing complex
    image recognition tasks across diverse datasets. Figure 7 The visualization of
    the heatmap of the four variants. The sampled leaf disease images consist of tomato
    late blight, grape black rot, corn gray leaf spot, potato early blight, and apple
    black rot. Full size image Visual analysis Heatmap To further investigate the
    impact of each module, the heatmap was used to present the attention regions of
    each model. The algorithm used for the heatmap is Grad-CAM46. Grad-CAM decodes
    the importance of each feature map for a specific class by analyzing the gradient
    in the convolutional layer. As shown in Fig. 7, five types of leaf disease images
    are taken as input to show the heatmap of the four models. The ER-Net is our constructed
    base leaf disease classification model based on CER-Block. As shown in the second
    row, it can identify the diseased regions in the leaf, enabling leaf disease classification.
    In the third row, the ER-Net incorporates the attention module CBAM13, which is
    designed for classic classification networks. Obviously, the CBAM is not suitable
    for leaf disease classification tasks. After the introduction of CBAM, the attention
    region of the model is confused, leading to unreliable classification results.
    In the fourth row, the CBAM is replaced with the proposed ACA-Block to form the
    ERC-Net. It can be observed that ERC-Net focuses on leaf disease regions but fails
    to learn fine-grained information in the images. In the last row, the BIF-Block
    is applied to fuse multi-perspective information and obtain the proposed ERCP-Net.
    The ERCP-Net can accurately and comprehensively focus on the disease regions in
    the leaf, achieving the best classification performance. Confusion matrix To identify
    the weaknesses of ERCP-Net, the confusion matrix is plotted in Fig. 8. It shows
    that our ERCP-Net has difficulty in distinguishing between the categories ”Corn
    gray leaf spot” and ”Corn northern leaf blight”, ”Tomato two spider mite”, and
    ”Tomato target spot”. Meanwhile, there exists an issue of uneven data distribution
    in the PlantVillage data. It is speculated that the deficiency in focusing on
    hard samples might be due to the cross-entropy loss. In future work, we will explore
    the potential enhancement by using the focal loss47. Figure 8 The confusion matrix
    of the classification results of ERCP-Net. The x and y axes in the confusion matrix
    correspond to the 38 categories of IDs. Full size image Figure 9 The results of
    plant leaf disease detection by the developed APP. Full size image Plant leaf
    disease identification APP Currently, few plant leaf diseases can be identified
    with lightweight smart devices. An APP for plant leaf disease identification is
    built to make the study of plant leaf diseases more convenient and common. The
    creation of an APP involves three processes. We should first define scope and
    target. The App is a portable application made to assist farmers in promptly identifying
    the type of leaf disease and promptly implementing preventive measures. Second,
    the APP interface presents information in an understandable manner, taking into
    account both design and user experience. The information display box and the picture
    upload button are the two components of the interface. When users launch the APP,
    they may quickly learn how to use it and its function. Thirdly, the front and
    back end comprise an application. Python is used for front end development, and
    Flask is the framework. Python is used for back end development, while Pytorch
    is used as a framework. A LAN must contain both the front end and the back end.
    The APP’s recognition algorithm is based on the ERCP-Net algorithm. The APP consists
    of two main functions: uploading pictures and recognizing plant leaf disease.
    The second function depends on the trained ERCP-Net model, which has an accuracy
    of 99.82\\(\\%\\) on the test set. When the images are uploaded, the terminal
    invokes our algorithm to recognize the images and display the results on the main
    screen. Specifically, three results are displayed: the type of plant leaf disease,
    recognition confidence, and inference time (in seconds). The APP’s performance
    has been tested extensively, and some results are shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows
    the results of the APP for identifying potato late blight, where the identification
    category is also potato late blight, with an confidence of 100\\(\\%\\) and inference
    time of 0.07s. The experimental results show that the APP equipped with the ERCP-Net
    model can identify plant leaf diseases easily and in real-time with high confidence
    and speed. It can prevent the spread of diseases and ensure the healthy growth
    of plants, assisting with precision agriculture applications. Figure 10 Server
    runtime and app runtime. Full size image Runtime In order to show the real-time
    performance of the model more clearly, we conducted experiments on two devices.
    The first device is our experimental server. The specification of the machine
    is conducted on a personal computer equipped with 32G RAM and an Nvidia GeForce
    RTX 3060 graphics card with 12G video memory, and the computer runs the Ubuntu
    18.04.6 LTS operating system. The second device is an Android phone with the APP
    on it. The specification of the machine is 16G RAM and Snapdragon 8 mobile platform
    Gen 2. The APP runs the Android 13. We performed 100 inference tests on two separate
    devices. The running time of the first device is from 0.04s to 0.06s. The average
    running time is 0.048s. The running time of the second device is from 0.05s to
    0.08s. The average running time is 0.065s. Based on the experimental results,
    it can be seen that there is a difference of 0.017s in the average running time
    of the two devices, which is within the acceptable range. The reasons for the
    difference in the running time of the two devices may be the device specifications
    and network latency. Fig.10 illustrates the running time of the two devices. Limitation
    and future work Despite the promising results achieved by our proposed ERCP-Net
    model, there are certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, our
    model’s performance might be influenced by variations in environmental conditions
    and imaging setups, as the dataset used for training and evaluation may not cover
    all possible scenarios. Additionally, the current version of ERCP-Net might face
    challenges in cases of extremely rare or unseen leaf diseases, as the training
    dataset may not comprehensively represent the entire spectrum of plant leaf diseases.
    To address the aforementioned limitations and further enhance the applicability
    of our model, future research directions include expanding the dataset to encompass
    a wider range of environmental conditions, imaging angles, and disease manifestations.
    The introduction of transfer learning techniques, pre-training on diverse datasets,
    and fine-tuning on specific plant species could contribute to improved generalization.
    Moreover, incorporating real-time disease monitoring capabilities and deploying
    the model in field conditions would be crucial for practical applications. Future
    research should focus on investigating interpretability techniques to comprehend
    the model’s decision-making process and on user studies to evaluate the model’s
    performance in practical situations. Conclusion In this paper, a new plant leaf
    disease classification network is developed based on deep learning and an attention
    mechanism. Firstly, based on multi-scale pooling and residual connection, the
    ER-Block is designed for image feature information extraction, which can triple
    the number of channels without increasing the number of network parameters while
    expanding the perceptual field and extracting feature information at multiple
    scales. Secondly, the ACA-Block is developed, which employs the inverse Gaussian
    probability density function to project the kernel size of the 1D convolution
    adaptively. In this way, it can receive feature maps of different scales and different
    numbers of channels, thereby making the backbone network focus more on the information
    of the leaf disease part and reducing the interference of redundant information.
    Finally, a feature fusion result prediction structure is proposed to improve the
    robustness of the network. Then, the plant leaf disease classification network
    ERCP-Net is constructed based on the above modules. ERCP-Net can reduce redundant
    information interference and focus more on leaf disease features by transforming
    the shallow image information into more abstract feature information. Also, unlike
    traditional image classification networks, ERCP-Net can focus on semantic and
    pixel-level information. Finally, an app is developed to identify plant leaf diseases
    with a simplified detection procedure. Experimental results show that the proposed
    ERCP-Net network performs better than existing approaches on the PlantVillage
    and AI challenger 2018 datasets, with accuracy of 99.82% and 86.21%. In future
    research, we will conduct in-depth research on the following two aspects. First,
    we will introduce small-sample learning to recognize some small-sample disease
    categories effectively. Plant disease recognition relies on a large amount of
    plant leaf image data. Nevertheless, in actual production, it is a great challenge
    to obtain the expected results for recognizing some disease categories whose images
    are difficult to collect or label. Second, the proposed model will be deployed
    to more sophisticated and intelligent machines, such as agricultural mobile robots,
    to develop an intelligent integrated process for data processing, identification,
    and detection. Data availability This study did not report any data. The proposed
    method was evaluated on publicly available diseases and insect pests detection
    datasets widely used in object detection: PlantVillage (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1)

    March 2024 Introduction Since the concept of a digital twin (DT) was emerged by
    Grieves M1., it has been introduced in various fields including aerospace, automotive,
    manufacturing, construction, real estate, health, medicine, and agriculture2,3,4,5,6.
    Though DT has broad meanings in various fields, it is generally defined as the
    implementation of virtual counterparts of real-world physical systems in a digital
    environment. It often allows users to simulate, model, and analyze data to make
    informed decisions7. DT relies on the integration of state-of-the-art technologies
    including information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of things
    (IoT), remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), big data analytics,
    and artificial intelligence (AI)8,9. The ICT provides the infrastructure and communication
    networks necessary for the acquisition, aggregation, storage, and analysis of
    data from IoT devices and remote sensing, thereby farmers can access and use digital
    platforms for precision farming and crop management. Wireless IoT devices such
    as sensors collect agricultural data including weather conditions, soil moisture,
    and crop physiological information10. Furthermore, digital imagery produced from
    UAV and satellites (remote sensing) has led to a paradigm shift for farmers and
    researchers from an approach of homogeneous management of heterogeneous fields
    to one of a heterogeneous management of heterogeneous fields (soil fertility,
    soil moisture, plant pathogens etc.)11. For this paradigm shift, the agricultural
    data should be managed in combination with longitudinal data and geospatial data
    for implementing agricultural practices at the right time and location. In particular,
    geospatial data enable farmers to apply input materials based on crop needs on
    a precise site-specific basis12. Given big data and systematic data management,
    AI such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used for predictions
    and data-driven decisions. The results provide farmers with insights for improving
    decision making and supplying the required input resources (water, fertilizer,
    pesticides, etc.) for every square meter in a crop field as needed at every plant
    growth stage11,13,14. There are a number of studies on agricultural digitalization
    using the above advanced technologies6,8,9,11,15. Jayaraman et al. presented an
    IoT-based platform, SmartFarmNet, that can automatically collect data on environments,
    soil conditions, fertilization, and irrigation10. Furthermore, it can integrate
    data from other sources, and all data can be stored on the cloud server to analyze
    and present the results to the API user. Teschner et al. showed that an UAV-based
    intrusion detection DT is effective in protecting agricultural fields16. In this
    study, all data was distributed over 5 G communication networks. Moghadam et al.
    initiated a DT at an orchard scale17. Specifically, they created a system that
    scans the status of every tree using 3D LiDAR cameras. This orchard DT enables
    continuous monitoring of tree’s health, structure, and fruit quality, and it predicts
    tree’s stress level, presence of disease, and yield loss. Given all information,
    the DT simulates various scenarios based on environmental and management parameters17.
    Delgado et al. proposed a WebGIS framework that collects geospatial data and aggregates
    into regional and global views of agriculture to support big data analytics for
    farmers and agricultural policymakers11. Verdouw & Kruize reported six cases of
    using the FIWARE open source platform for the development of agricultural DT for
    the first time18. The FIWARE easily connects IoT sensors and provides cloud services
    and Open APIs to enable real-time data processing and big data analysis. As an
    example of crop management using a deep learning algorithm, Anagnostis et al.
    proposed an approach for orchard tree segmentation using aerial images based on
    the U-net algorithm, a convolutional neural network variant19. This model was
    proven to be effective in the detection and localization of tree canopies, achieving
    performance levels up to 99%. Jiang et al. predicted forest change trends in the
    study area using a DT approach based on machine learning20. This DT was based
    on remote sensing imagery from the Landsat 7 satellite to investigate forestry
    canopy, species, and distribution succession. In post-harvest management, Tagliavini
    et al. proposed a DT that can manage the quality of harvested mangoes21. In this
    case, throughout the cold chain, computational fluid dynamics was used to evaluate
    quality losses, such as fruit firmness, total soluble solids, acidity, and vitamin
    content. As such, applications of DT have become sophisticated and diversified.
    The Republic of Korea established a smart farm research policy to advance smart
    farm research from indoor greenhouses to open fields. As part of this, our research
    team aimed to develop a DT for managing mandarin (Citrus unshiu) orchards in open
    fields. Fruit crops are propagated through asexual reproduction (grafting), resulting
    in every tree being of the identical genomes. Additionally, as fruit crops are
    perennial, the data can be updated annually from the same individuals, enabling
    spatiotemporal analysis. Unlike other crops, fruit crops require ample space per
    individual, which facilitates the collection of individual-specific data. Unfortunately,
    unforeseeable research policy changes with budget cuts stopped all open-field
    smart farm research projects. As a result, we could not continue collaborations
    with data producers involved in mandarin cultivation. As a surrogate, we aggregated
    and centralized the data that was available independently from different sources
    (Fig. 1). According to the Act on Promotion of the Provision and Use of Public
    Data22, the Korean government has released a large number of datasets generated
    from various national and public institutions, and this public information is
    referred to as open data. Each public institution can directly provide open data
    generated and acquired by itself, as well as through the open data portal (https://www.data.go.kr),
    an integrated archive that can store and provide all open data in one site. The
    Rural Development Administration (RDA) annually surveys soil chemical properties
    according to land-use type and provides the information to farmers for field-specific
    fertilization. Using this information, farmers can supply an appropriate amount
    of fertilizer to crops at a low cost and contribute to environmental conservation
    by eliminating fertilizer misuse and preventing soil leakage. Jeju Island, located
    at the lowest latitude in the Korean Peninsula, produces mandarin fruits with
    a dormant volcano in the center of the island. The Jeju Free International City
    Development Center (JDC) collected data on fruit sugar content and size, weather
    information, and agricultural practices in mandarin orchards. The JDC surveyed
    thirty randomly selected orchards in 2021 and has made the information available
    through the data portal. Geocoding of the data was performed through the Kakao
    Developers server based on regional codes and address information published by
    the Ministry of the Interior and Safety (MOIS). In order to visualize the geocoded
    data on a map, the GIS map files were downloaded from the National Spatial Data
    Infrastructure Portal (NSDIP). All open data is distributed through the Open API,
    and it is freely and easily accessible23. Fig. 1: The schematic diagram illustrates
    the process of data collection, analysis, and decision-making support via an agricultural
    digital twin. The independent data collected from various sources through the
    Open API are merged and geocoded with spatial information. The merged data can
    be displayed on a GIS map and analyzed using various statistical methods and machine
    learning algorithms. The analyzed data enable regional scale, inter-orchard, or
    intra-orchard analysis, providing customized information based on the perspective
    of stakeholders. Through this process, stakeholders can receive support for regional
    or orchard-level decisions, and they can obtain customized information at the
    tree-level within an orchard. Therefore, future agricultural systems have potential
    to evolve from precision agriculture to individualized agriculture. On the map
    of Jeju Island, the gray dots indicate the location of all identified orchards,
    and the purple dots indicate the selected orchards presented in this paper. The
    abbreviations are as follows: MOIS, Ministry of the Interior and Safety; RDA,
    Rural Development Administration; JDC, Jeju Free International City Development
    Center; NSDIP, National Spatial Data Infrastructure Portal. Source data are provided
    as a Source Data file. Full size image The aim of this study is to showcase the
    feasibility of an agricultural DT to support data monitoring and data-driven decisions.
    We selected mandarin as a model crop for this study due to its wide cultivation
    in Jeju Island and its perennial nature. We judged that such sustainable conditions
    are necessary for the long-term success of DT in the future. This article illustrates
    that through the integration of multiple datasets obtained from diverse sources
    (utilizing Open APIs) and the creation of a DT for mandarin orchard management,
    we can achieve not only precision agriculture but also individualized agriculture,
    where each fruit tree is managed on an individual basis. The available datasets
    encompass various information including soil chemical properties, fruit quality,
    weather data, and agricultural practices; they are analyzed at regional, inter-orchard,
    and intra-orchard scales; and an interactive applet, R Shiny, is created to demonstrate
    how an agricultural DT can support data-driven decisions for policymakers, researchers,
    distributors, and farmers. It is very important to monitor at regional, inter-orchard,
    and intra-orchard levels, and in particular, it is essential to monitor fruit
    quality from individual trees on a regular basis for successful individualized
    agriculture, and the DT can add value by making the monitoring accurate and efficient.
    Results Regional scale analyses The spatial information and observed soil components
    are presented in Fig. 2 using the kernel density estimation (KDE). The soil components
    include available phosphate, exchangeable cations (Exch. K, Ca, and Mg), acidity
    (pH), organic matter, and electrical conductivity. The color gradation from blue
    (low values) to yellow (high values) is used in the figure. This visualization
    accounts for locations and soil conditions observed in Jeju Island, excluding
    the other available information such as rice paddy and greenhouse soils from the
    KDE analysis. The levels of available phosphate, Exch. K and Mg, pH, and electrical
    conductivity tended to be higher in the western region of the island, when compared
    to the eastern region, in contrast to Exch. Ca and organic matter. According to
    the JARES report24, the western part of Jeju Island is a non-volcanic ash soil
    area which is similar to the land soil of the Korean Peninsula and is highly productive.
    On the other hand, the eastern part is a volcanic ash soil which is characterized
    by low organic matter and available phosphate content and high Exch. Ca content.
    These soil characteristics are likely responsible for the high available phosphate
    content of the orchards in the western region, a non-volcanic ash soil region
    (Fig. 2A). Relative to the western region, the observed levels of available phosphate
    in the eastern region were close to 200–300 mg kg−1 which is a range recommended
    by RDA. It appears that farmers in the eastern region applied a lot of organic
    fertilizer to address the low organic matter content due to the regional characteristics
    of a volcanic ash soil. As a result, the observed levels of organic matter in
    the eastern region were above the recommended level of 110–150 g kg−1 (Fig. 2F).
    If these patterns are continuously observed and confirmed, policymakers or local
    government agricultural officials may plan for the supply and demand of organic
    fertilizer in Jeju and prepare alternatives to resolve regional imbalances. Additionally,
    the western region is more likely to be alkaline due to the higher soil pH, and
    policymakers need to encourage the supply of pH-lowering lime-based fertilizers
    to orchards in the western region. Currently, frequencies of soil data collection
    are irregular and soil data are relatively scarce (about once a year). More frequent
    data collection is needed to increase knowledge regarding the regional soil conditions
    and regional relationships with mandarin fruit quality. Fig. 2: Kernel density

    The estimated level of each soil chemical component near the selected mandarin
    orchards is represented by the color gradation from blue (low values) to yellow
    (high values) in each panel. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full
    size image The anticipated fruit size and sugar content may depend on regions
    and harvest time. The time- and location-specific estimates are depicted in Fig.
    3. The size of each data point is proportional to the estimated average fruit
    size, and sugar content levels are color-coded. A darker color (brown) indicates
    a high sugar level (>11.5° Brix). In late October, it was uncommon to observe
    an average sugar level above 11.5° Brix, but it was more common in mid- and late
    November. During late November, the observed sugar level was higher in the orchards
    located in the southern region (latitude below 33.4°N) than the orchards in the
    northern region. It appears that the time and location served as informative layers
    that influence the sugar content and fruit size, respectively. Fig. 3: Spatiotemporal
    variability of sugar content and fruit size with respect to mandarin orchards
    in Jeju Island. The changes in sugar content and fruit size by orchard and time
    (from the fourth-fifth weeks of October to the third-fourth weeks of November)
    are indicated by the circle type (open and closed) and the size. With a digital
    twin, fruit quality data can be explained by specific location and time. The figure
    represents 27 selected mandarin orchards of the 30 mandarin orchards surveyed
    by Jeju Free International City Development Center. Source data are provided as
    a Source Data file. Full size image The merged dataset showed that sugar content
    had monotonic relationships with some soil- (Exch. K, Mg, pH, and electrical conductivity)
    and weather-related variables (temperature and humidity) and non-monotonic relationships
    with available phosphate, Exch. Ca, organic matter, and air pressure. Relatively
    high sugar content, rather than big fruit size, was observed near the ranges of
    available phosphate and organic matter recommended by the RDA (Fig. 4A, F). In
    contrast, Exch. Ca had a stronger relationship with fruit size rather than with
    sugar content (Fig. 4C). This observation suggests suppressing excessive application
    of Ca fertilizer in order to avoid oversized fruit. The sugar content tended to
    increase when air pressure is between 0 and 5 atm, while the fruit size tended
    to decrease. The opposite trends were observed when air pressure is above 6 atm
    (Fig. 4J). The inverse relationship between sugar content and fruit size was also
    found in the recommended ranges of available phosphate, Exch. Ca, and organic
    matter. As explained above, however, if variations in sugar content and fruit
    size were primarily influenced by the soil and weather factors, it would not be
    possible for farmers to artificially control these factors by altering air pressure.

    The gray box represents the appropriate range for each component of mandarin orchard
    soil recommended by the Rural Development Administration. Source data are provided
    as a Source Data file. Full size image Inter-field analyses The frequency and
    time of agricultural practices varied among orchards. The majority of orchards
    (27 out of 30) recorded and provided information on agricultural practices including
    pruning, fertilization, spraying, mulching, and thinning. Pruning is the process
    of selectively removing parts of a plant, such as branches or stems, with the
    aim of enhancing plant growth, increasing fruit yield, and improving overall fruit
    quality25. Pruning plays crucial roles in achieving high-quality fruit production
    and maintaining a consistent fruit size26. Additionally, it stimulates sugar content
    in the fruit. Optimal fertilization increases fruit production by influencing
    fruit weight and quality27. Spraying can help control pests and diseases that
    can harm trees and lower fruit quality. Mulching serves for retaining soil moisture
    and suppressing weed competition which promote plant growth. Thinning is an vital
    agricultural practice in fruit production that is used to reduce the number of
    fruits per tree and improve fruit size28. While each agricultural practice is
    known to be beneficial, the observed frequency and time of application varied
    between orchards. Supplementary Fig. 1 presents a ridge plot displaying the monthly
    frequencies of agricultural practices performed by all orchards combined. The
    spraying started in March and was frequently done between April and September,
    and this kind of information allows researchers to investigate the targeted prevalent
    pathogens or pests. Thinning of fruits occurred between April and September with
    most farmers doing it in July or August. Farmers generally made similar decisions
    regarding the time of mulching (mostly in June or July) and pruning (typically
    in March). However, the timing of fertilization showed high variability, ranging
    from February to July, and some farmers fertilized even in January and October.
    If this kind of information on agricultural practices is available over time and
    is associated with fruit quality, it will facilitate planning and operational
    decisions. Such a system will be especially beneficial for inexperienced farmers
    or those new to the region. For the marketing purpose, fruit quality is categorized
    based on the two main factors, sugar content and fruit size. Mandarin fruits typically
    have a sugar content exceeding 10° Brix to be sold. Given this condition, quality
    classes were established based on the fruit size as follows: too small (<49 mm),
    2 S (49–54), S (54–59), M (59–63), L (63–67), 2 L (67–71), and too large (>71).
    Fruits that were either too small or too large were deemed unsaleable, while the
    other classes were suitable for the market. Fruits classified as S or M were rated
    as prime grade, indicating the highest quality, and fruits categorized as 2 S,
    L, or 2 L were rated as saleable at a fair quality. The fruit quality and soil
    chemical properties were compared between the two orchards, Hab in the western
    region and Iab in the eastern region, which growed the same cultivar named Miyagawa
    Wase. The comparison revealed significant differences in soil chemical properties
    which could be associated with the variations in fruit quality (Fig. 5 and Table
    1). The gray box in Fig. 5A represents the recommended fertilization standards
    by RDA29. The Iab orchard had a low level of available phosphate content and a
    high level of Exch. Ca content due to the characteristics of volcanic ash soil
    found in the eastern region. Most orchards had adequate levels of organic matter
    due to government policies aiming at increasing the supply of organic fertilizer.
    However, unlike the Iab orchard, the Hab orchard had a high level of electrical
    conductivity which indicates an excess of nutrients in the soil that can negatively
    impact the nutrients uptake by the mandarin tree. The Iab orchard performed the
    agricultural practices in later months than the Hab orchard did with an exception
    of pruning (Fig. 5B). The sugar content of Iab was higher, except in late October,
    and the fruit size of Iab was larger, except in early November (Fig. 5C), when
    compared to those of Hab. The fruit sugar content from both orchards exceeded
    the marketable standard of 10° Brix. However, if this pattern persists annually,
    it is advisable to harvest from the third week of October to the first week of
    November for the Iab orchard and from the first week of November to the fourth
    week of November for the Hab orchard (Fig. 5D) in order to obtain prime grade
    fruit (54–63 mm). Fig. 5: Inter-orchard analysis between the two orchards, Hab
    (located in the eastern region) and Iab (western region). The soil chemical properties
    of the two orchards are compared with the fertilization standard (gray box) recommended
    by the Rural Development Administration (A). The monthly frequency of each agricultural
    practice is compared between the two orchards, and Comparison of monthly number

    the boxplots (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) of

    and (7.2, 10.3, 11.7, 12.9, 16.3) in mid-10, (8.2, 10.1, 10.9, 11.6, 14.4) in
    late-10, and (8.8, 11.6, 12.2, 12.8, 15.5) in early-11 for Iab. The 5-number summaries

    11-2 for the Iab orchard (D). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
    Full size image Table 1 The comparison between the Hab and Iab orchards in Jeju
    Island Full size table Significant variations in fruit ripening and quality were
    observed between the two orchards, even though they were growing the same cultivar,
    indicating the identical genotype. These differences can be attributed to distinct
    environmental factors and variations in agricultural practices and management
    as discussed earlier. Similarly, notable variations in sugar content and fruit
    size were observed within the same orchard (Fig. 5C), despite growing the same
    genotype. These variations on a smaller scale are likely influenced by micro-environmental
    factors. This clearly emphasizes the importance of collecting micro-environmental
    data within the orchard. Such data will provide information on the environment × management
    interaction for researchers and profits for farmers and distributors. They can
    sell and purchase high-quality fruits from each orchard at optimal times to maximize
    their profits. There were different trends in sugar content and fruit size among
    orchards. The inter-orchard variation in fruit size, where the median size ranged
    from 43.9 to 67.6 mm, was significantly greater than the inter-orchard variation
    in sugar content, which ranged from 9.8 to 12.1 °Brix (Fig. 6). Unlike sugar content,
    the orchard with the lowest median fruit size (Xab) and the orchard with the largest
    median fruit size (Uab) were clearly distinguishable (Fig. 6B). The Xab orchard
    produced fruits of relatively high sugar content, whereas the Uab orchard produced
    fruits of relatively low sugar content (Fig. 6A). As aforementioned in the regional
    scale analysis (Fig. 4), it seems that sugar content and fruit size are inversely
    related in mandarin fruit. To this end, the determination of harvest time is very
    important to balance the two mandarin quality factors, which eventually increase
    the proportion of prime grade fruit. Fig. 6: The distributions of sugar content
    and fruit size by orchard. A: sugar content, B: fruit size. The orchards are ordered
    by the median sugar content (A) and the median fruit size (B) among N = 39,679
    fruits observed between mid-October (the third week of October) and late November
    (the fourth week of November) in the 27 orchards. The Nab orchard has the lowest
    median sugar content (°Bx), and the 5-number summary of its boxplot (minimum,
    first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) is (6.6, 9.1, 9.8, 10.6,
    14.1). The Cbb orchard has the highest median sugar content, and the 5-number
    summary of its boxplot is (8.2, 11.3, 12.1, 12.9, 15.3). The Xab orchard has the
    smallest median size (mm), and the 5-number summary of its boxplot is (40.3, 42.3,
    43.9, 46.3, 54.5). The Uab orchard has the largest median size (mm), and the 5-number
    summary of its boxplot is (55.9, 63.7, 67.6, 71.8, 80.4) where the minimum size
    observed Uab (55.9 mm) is greater than the maximum size observed Xab (40.3 mm).
    Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Additionally,
    the trend of sugar content increased over time in most orchards, while the trend
    in fruit size did not follow a consistent pattern across orchards (Supplementary
    Fig. 2). Mandarin fruit was harvested simultaneously starting from the third week
    of October, coinciding with the beginning of fruit quality surveys. The mixed-effects
    model estimated that the mean sugar content continued increasing over time, largely
    unaffected by ongoing harvesting, and the continual increase of the mean sugar
    content was strongly significant (p < 0.001). When compared to the initial week,
    the third week of October (denoted by 10-3), the estimated mean sugar content
    was higher by 0.309, 0.308, 0.658, 1.047, 1.248, and 1.435 °Brix for 10-4, 10-5,
    11-1, 11-2, 11-3, and 11-4, respectively. The model estimated that the mean fruit
    size decreased after the initial week, but the pattern was not as clear as the
    mean sugar content. See Supplementary Table 1 for the estimated parameters under
    the mixed-effect model. The time factor is limited to soil, weather, and agricultural
    practices in our research data. When the same cultivar is planted, variations
    in the longitudinal trend of fruit quality between orchards can be attributed
    to different environments and management. The automatic machine learning (AutoML)
    algorithm, implemented by the ‘h2o’ package in R30, predicted the fruit size better
    than the sugar content when they were analyzed with the time of fruit observation
    and orchard-level variables including the five agricultural practices (fertilization,
    mulching, pruning, spraying, and thinning) and the three weather variables (temperature,
    humidity, air pressure). The selected model was the stacked ensemble model which
    resulted in root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.76,
    and R-square (R2) = 0.43 for sugar content and RMSE = 3.73, MAE = 2.96, and R2 = 0.84
    for fruit size. The orchard index was identified as the most important predictor
    followed by air pressure for both sugar content and fruit size. At the orchard-level,
    the prediction of fruit size is substantially better than of sugar content (Fig.
    7), and it implies that intra-orchard analysis may be needed especially to improve
    the sugar content prediction. Fig. 7: The scatterplot of the predicted and observed
    sugar content and fruit size using machine learning models based on weather and
    fruit quality data. A: sugar content, B: fruit size. Source data are provided
    as a Source Data file. Full size image Intra-field analyses Significant variability
    in fruit quality was observed within orchards. In addition to differences between
    orchards, it is crucial to comprehend the variability of fruit quality within
    orchards, known as intra-orchard differences. For illustrative purposes, the Iab
    orchard is selected in Fig. 8. In the dataset, fruit samples were categorized
    into high, middle, and low positions based on their height from the ground level,
    and three samples were collected from each position per tree each week. The distributions
    of sugar content and fruit size seemed to be quite similar across the three position
    levels (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8: Intra-orchard analyses of the Iab orchard. The distribution
    of sugar content and of fruit size are compared by the position of the fruit on
    the tree with respect to time; 3 mandarins per tree (one in each position) and
    100 trees. The distributions are similar across the three positions, but they
    are different with respect to time. Combining all positions, the 5-number summaries
    for the boxplots (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum)
    of sugar content (°Bx) are (7.2, 10.3, 11.7, 12.9, 16.3) in 10-3, (82, 10.1, 10.9,
    11.6, 14.4) in 10-4, (8.9, 10.7, 11.8, 12.3, 15.1) in 11-1, and (8.8, 12.2, 12.6,
    13.0, 15.5) in 11-2; and the 5-number summaries of fruit size (mm) are (44.9,
    53.2, 61.6, 67.8, 75.8) in 10-3, (47.1, 49.9, 53.2, 56.3, 59.4) in 10-4, (46.9,
    50.0, 53.1, 55.8, 58.7) in 11-1, and (40.1, 41.1, 41.9, 43.1, 43.9) in 11-2 (A).
    The hierarchical clustering analysis of sugar content and fruit size (longitudinal
    observations of the 100 trees) is shown using 4 clusters (B). Source data are
    provided as a Source Data file. Full size image When analyzed with the mixed-effect
    model, there was a difference in expected sugar content based on the position,
    but the estimated difference in average sugar content was minimal. Fruits in the
    high position had higher sugar content than those in the middle position only
    by 0.020 °Brix on average (p = 0.131), and fruits in the middle position had higher
    sugar content than those in the low position by 0.039 °Brix on average (p = 0.000251).
    However, there were no statistically significant differences in fruit size among
    the three positions. Therefore, grading fruits based on their position appears
    to have little practical significance. See Supplementary Table 2 for the estimated
    parameters under the mixed-effect model. Hierarchical clustering analysis grouped
    individual trees in the Iab orchard into four clusters based on the observed trends
    of sugar content and fruit size over time (Fig. 8). One of the clusters (Cluster
    2 in Fig. 8A) clearly shows an increasing trend of sugar content during the survey
    period, whereas the other three clusters do not. On the other hand, all of the
    four clusters show decreasing trends of fruit size (Fig. 8B). There was substantial
    variation in sugar content among trees over time, indicating potential room for
    improvement in sugar content with specific management practices, even when the
    same cultivar is planted in the same orchard. For instance, after identifying
    a group of trees producing fruits with low sugar content through hierarchical
    clustering analysis (Cluster 3 in Fig. 8A), customized agricultural practices
    can be applied to each selected tree to improve its sugar content. The groups
    were categorized based on sugar content in the third week of October, when the
    investigation began. Trees with high sugar content in the third week of October
    maintained high sugar content until the second week of November. In contrast,
    trees with initially low sugar content retained low sugar content until the second
    week of November. Therefore, trees with low sugar content may benefit from tailored
    agricultural practices such as rain-shelter cultivation, irrigation control, foliar
    fertilization, proper pruning, and thinning to enhance their sugar content. Similarly,
    when clustering analysis identifies trees with very small fruit sizes, simultaneous
    agricultural practices like fruit thinning or late harvesting can be applied.
    As such, clustering analysis can be another statistical tool for individualized
    agriculture by determining specific needs of individual trees to improve sugar
    content and fruit size. The orchard-level mixed-effects model demonstrates the
    potential of individualized agriculture within each orchard. When considering
    the harvest time and the five orchard-level agricultural practices only, 19% of
    the variance in sugar content was explained (R2 = 0.19). However, the orchard-level
    mixed-effects model explained 38% of the variance in sugar content (R2 = 0.38),
    indicating that the current orchard-level practices have limited capacity to explain
    the variation in sugar content between orchards. On the other hand, when the tree-level
    model was applied, 66% of the variance in sugar content was explained (R2 = 0.66).
    Figure 9 displays the scatterplot of predicted and observed values of sugar content,
    highlighting the different predictive powers between inter-field analysis (Fig.
    9A) and intra-field analysis (Fig. 9B). It appears that the predictive power of
    the intra-field analysis is better than of the inter-field analysis which implies
    that farmers can benefit from tree-level management (individualized agriculture)
    in addition to the orchard-level management (precision agriculture), and an agricultural
    DT can be a helpful tool for monitoring individual trees in an orchard. As such,
    the development of DT has a potential to open up the transition from precision
    agriculture to individualized agriculture. All supplementary data used to create

    DT demonstration For the purpose of demonstration, a tree of the Iab orchard is
    demonstrated using the agricultural DT (https://stevenkimcsumb.shinyapps.io/ShinyDT/).
    In the webpage, the user may select the orchard (Iab), click on the Submit button
    below, select the fifth tree (Iab-5), and click on the Submit button below. After
    the submission, there are nine panels shown: Map, Soil, Weather, Agricultural
    Practice, Sugar Content Distribution, Fruit Size Distribution, Sugar Content History,
    and Fruit Size History. The Map panel presents the location of the Iab orchard
    in Jeju Island. The Soil panel presents the percentile of each soil component
    (available phosphate, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable
    magnesium, soil acidity, organic matter, electric conductivity) compared to other
    areas in the island. It also shows whether the observed level is within the RDA
    recommendation or not. The Weather panel presents the percentile of temperature,
    humidity, and air pressure compared to other areas in the island. The Agricultural
    Practice panel compares the five agricultural practices (fertilization, mulching,
    spraying, pruning, and thinning) to other orchards in the island. The Sugar Content
    Distribution and Fruit Size Distribution compare the sugar content and fruit size,
    respectively. In each panel, the Iab orchard is compared to other orchards in
    the island, and the Iab-5 tree is compared to other trees in the Iab orchard.
    The Sugar Content History and Fruit Size History show the weekly patterns of sugar
    content and fruit size, respectively, at orchard-level and tree-level. The DT
    will show that the average sugar content and fruit size increases and decreases,
    respectively, with respect to time at both orchard-level (Iab) and tree-level
    (Iab-5). Discussion Digital twin for soil management Incorporating detailed soil
    information into regional monitoring for precision agriculture would be highly
    beneficial. One promising approach is the utilization of satellite image analysis
    proposed by ref. 31. This method involves the analysis of data obtained through
    remote sensing, allowing for the visualization of the distribution of individual
    soil components on a field-by-field basis. It can also provide critical soil information
    at a fine scale. They demonstrated that a near-infrared spectroscopy technology
    can efficiently measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soil. This non-destructive
    method can resolve disadvantages associated with conventional destructive methods
    for soil measurement. Furthermore, it can be combined with image data from UAV
    or satellites to streamline and expedite data acquisition process. For instance,
    field-scale soil moisture maps have been generated by utilizing data from Landsat8,32,
    including the normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature.
    Additionally, yield prediction models have been established by integrating soil
    moisture and maize yield data33. Using orchard-level soil chemical information
    from satellite imagery, it will be feasible to develop a DT which can generate
    regional and orchard-level maps of soil profile and predict fruit quality. Fruit
    trees occupy a larger space than other crops, and soil components vary within
    the space of an orchard. A fruit tree is directly affected by the soil underneath
    the tree rather than all soil in the entire field. Furthermore, achieving uniform
    fertilizer distribution within the two-dimensional space of an orchard is challenging,
    and it becomes even more complex to discern variations in fruit quality based
    on the regional or orchard-level soil chemical components. If we could measure
    the soil chemical components at specific points using an IoT sensor, it would
    be feasible to apply fertilization tailored to each component’s needs. This means
    that each tree would receive the precise amount of soil nutrients necessary for
    its optimal growth, and point-specific fertilization would facilitate precision
    agriculture and precision conservation by minimizing fertilizer misuse. A map
    representing the soil chemical properties should provide interactive soil and
    fruit information on the website for each point in the field, along with spatial
    information for stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, researchers, farmers). The GIS
    serves as a fundamental framework for analysis of all data in relation to location.
    Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to integrate spatial information with data
    on fruit quality, weather conditions, and agricultural practices, including activities
    like spraying, pruning, and thinning. This integration provides regional-level,
    orchard-level, and tree-level information. Digital twin for agricultural practice
    management Agricultural practices have a direct and significant impact on fruit
    quality. Unlike certain environmental factors, these practices are under human
    control and can be implemented throughout the year. As more data accumulates,
    the monthly records of agricultural practices become increasingly valuable. Moreover,
    information on agricultural practices from neighboring orchards of a specific
    orchard is more relevant than information from distant areas. This localized information
    is rooted in the local environment and accounts for inter-field variations. Spraying
    data, in combination with spatial and weather data, can serve as an effective
    disease and pest monitoring system. Since the spread of fungal diseases is closely
    linked to weather conditions, such as raindrops and wind34,35, this system can
    be used to predict disease outbreaks and facilitate preventive measures. By closely
    monitoring and analyzing time-series data on disease outbreaks in conjunction
    with spatial information, it may be possible to lower the likelihood or reduce
    the loss due to disease spread. The important initial step is to establish automated
    systems for frequent data collection and management for all orchards. The significance
    of agricultural practices can be assessed by increased fruit yield. For instance,
    pruning plays a crucial role in shaping trees and promoting flower bud differentiation,
    directly influencing fruit production. By meticulously organizing pruning-related
    data (such as pruning techniques, location of flower buds, by-product weight resulting
    from pruning, etc.) and metadata for survey items, the correlation between pruning
    and fruit production can be thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, this approach allows
    for a comprehensive investigation into yield variations among different cultivars
    based on pruning methods. As a result, the functionality of an agricultural DT
    can be leveraged to create optimal environmental conditions tailored to specific
    cultivars. Digital twin for weather information management Weather information
    plays a crucial role in agricultural practices and fruit quality. For example,
    flower or fruit thinning should commence during the flowering period, and it is
    important to avoid rains when thinning chemicals are applied. Decisions on the
    timing of agricultural practices should be made based on weather information,
    and it can be equipped in a DT. Moreover, it is pivotal to develop various weather
    metrics and metadata to study their influence on specific targets, such as fruit
    quality, based on the crop species. This is necessary because each crop has its
    unique optimal environmental conditions. Digital twin for fruit quality management
    The overarching goal is to increase the fruit quality, but too many factors are
    associated with it. As presented in this study, fruit quality significantly varies
    between orchards and within orchards (e.g., the Iab orchard in Fig. 8). In particular,
    given the regular data updates, the tree-level variations and the longitudinal
    patterns can be monitored for the purpose of quality control. In this sense, individualized
    agriculture will become a feasible agricultural system in the future. The current
    agricultural system, which produces high-quality products in small areas, such
    as greenhouses, can be expanded and applied to large areas of open fields in the
    future. The application of individualized agriculture is essential not only for
    the production of high-quality agricultural products in large areas but for multi-variety
    small-scale production systems as well. Recently, space agriculture has been explored
    in the context of space development, and the application of individualized agriculture
    is fundamental to produce agricultural products in a limited space. An agricultural
    DT must be a shared tool for stakeholders. It requires active discussion among
    stakeholders, updates on a regular basis, and continuous improvements for helpful
    real-world feedback. For policymakers, data visualization like Fig. 2 can guide
    their regional decisions. Such information can be reflected in the budget of policymakers
    who are in charge of agricultural soils and fertilizer supply in Jeju Island.
    For distributors, data visualizations like Figs. 6, 7, and 8 can support inter-orchard
    quality assessment and tracking. If more detailed information is available than
    presented in this study, a DT can provide information regarding yield forecasts,
    expected profits, and management of distributed fruit. For researchers, data visualization
    like Figs. 3 and 4 can help understand regional and inter-orchard variations,
    generate and test hypotheses, and make practical suggestions. They can even plan
    matched studies by cultivar and conduct cultivar-specific studies. Finally, for
    farmers, Fig. 8 can help assess intra-orchard fruit quality and monitor longitudinal
    patterns after performing particular agricultural practices, and a DT can present
    detailed information at tree-level. Improving or maintaining high fruit quality
    is both science and art, and farmers shall balance between empirical evidence
    and farmers’ observations, experiences, and knowledge. At this point, it is an
    open question whether an individualized tree-level management will be more profitable
    than regional or orchard-level management. We need to consider how to lower the
    cost of implementing DT. The magnitude of benefits from implementing DT is unknown
    as of now, and we need a scientific approach to this question. We need to compare
    current regional or orchard-level practice versus new individualized agriculture
    guided by DT using a controlled randomized experiment. Dividing orchards into
    the control zone and experimental zone, it is necessary to confirm and estimate
    the benefit of DT. This study is limited to mandarin fruit with observational
    data, but we want to observe and experiment with more kinds of fruit. Unlike the
    current speed of technological advances, it will be a patient process. Applying
    individualized agriculture to cereal or vegetable crops is very challenging. Because
    individual plants of cereal or vegetable crops are not genetically identical,
    it is difficult to expect the same quality or yield under the same environment
    or management. In contrast, fruit crops (like mandarins) are relatively easy to
    study at individual levels and feasible to apply individualized agriculture because
    each tree propagates through asexual reproduction and have identical genomes.
    Thus, when researching orchards that cultivate a single cultivar (genotype), the
    variations in the phenotypes they exhibit are influenced by the environment and
    agricultural practices (management). Researching this genotype × environment × 
    management interaction remains highly challenging, and more experimentations are
    needed to address this complex question. From the consumers’ perspective, regardless
    of the scientific merit of individualized agriculture, most consumers would not
    purchase a ten-dollar high-quality mandarin in South Korea and elsewhere. Future
    studies should address lowering the cost and labor in data collection, precision
    agriculture, and individualized agriculture. The long-term objective of our research
    team is to make regional, inter-orchard, and intra-orchard information more complete
    and accessible through interactive digital platforms, tailored to the goals and
    needs of stakeholders. We are currently developing a streamlined process that
    automatically retrieves data via an Open API, securely stores it on a cloud server,
    conducts comprehensive analyses, and disseminates the results to various IT devices.
    As an initial step, we have developed a freely accessible webpage (https://stevenkimcsumb.shinyapps.io/ShinyDT/)
    for demonstration purposes based on all information currently available to us.
    This version of DT does not demonstrate how to automatically suggest agricultural
    practices and how to assess the effect of the agricultural practices on fruit
    quality, and it is a main limitation of our study. The current form of interactive
    applet is to be improved over time and communicated with the stakeholders in order
    to operate in a closed loop. We anticipate that the agricultural DT opens a new
    era of individualized agriculture via interdisciplinary collaboration among agricultural
    researchers, farmers, statisticians, software engineers, and more. Methods Data
    resources and collection through Open API Publicly accessible Open APIs, which
    are potential sources for developing an agricultural DT for mandarin orchard management,
    were collected from multiple sources on the data portal (https://www.data.go.kr).
    All processes including data collection, parsing, and analysis were performed
    using statistical software R36. The regional codes were obtained from the MOIS,
    soil data were obtained from the RDA of Republic Korea, and data on fruit quality,
    weather, and agricultural practices of mandarin orchards were obtained from the
    JDC (Fig. 1). The soil data analyzed from 2020 to 2022 were collected by the administrative
    district of Jeju using ‘xml’37 and ‘jsonlite’38 packages in R. The chemical properties
    of 30,261 agricultural soils in Jeju Island were crawled, and 5939 orchard soils
    were used for our analysis. The soil data included available phosphate, Exch.
    K, Ca, and Mg, pH, organic matter, and electrical conductivity. The JDC randomly
    selected the 30 mandarin orchards in Jeju and collected data on weather, agricultural
    practices, and fruit quality from each orchard. The weather data were obtained
    by installing a sensor at each orchard which is capable of recording temperature,
    relative humidity, and air pressure (daily average). The data on agricultural
    practices were self-reported by the farmers, and they reported practice type,
    treatment amount, date, units, and agrochemical product name. One hundred mandarin
    trees were randomly selected in each orchard, and these trees were repeatedly
    observed from the third week of October to the fourth week of November in 2021.
    The sugar content (°Brix), fruit size (mm), and fruit position (high, middle,
    and low) were recorded with three replicates (one per fruit position level) each
    week per tree. These fruit quality data were measured manually by investigators
    using destructive measuring methods. All fruit-level information (sugar content,
    fruit size, and position) was matched with the month, week, day, and tag number
    (tree identification number). See the Data Availability section for more information.
    Data parsing Geocoding is a computation process of converting address information
    into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and it can be used to map
    locations. All address information in Jeju Island associated with the soil data
    was integrated into one file for the geocoding. All data were geocoded to add
    the spatial information through the server developed by Kakao, and all data were
    merged using R packages including ‘rjsonio’39, ‘data.table’40, ‘dplyr’41, and
    ‘httr’42. A single data frame was created by merging the geocoding data and the
    soil data, and it was used for map visualization using R packages including ‘terra’43,
    ‘maps’44, ‘sp’45, and ‘sf’46. For this map visualization, the GIS maps (shape
    files) provided by the NSDIP were used (Fig. 1). The regional-level, orchard-level,
    and tree-level data were merged and used for inter-orchard analysis (e.g., variation
    between orchards) and intra-orchard analysis (e.g., variation between trees within
    the same orchard). Combining all data, an agricultural DT was created with the
    four kinds of information: soil, weather, agricultural management practice, and
    fruit quality. Regional-scale data visualization and analysis For the regional-scale
    data visualization, a 1-km grid map was created by a shape file using the QGIS
    program (v 3.26.2)47, and it was combined with the soil data (available phosphate,
    Exch. K, Ca, and Mg, pH, organic matter, and electrical conductivity) after averaging
    observed values of each soil chemical component within each grid (Fig. 2A–G).
    The KDE was applied to describe the regional level of each soil component. The
    kernel-smoothed intensity function could be estimated given soil data values with
    the associated longitudes and latitudes. There were regions where data are sparse,
    and it was assumed that soil conditions are more similar when two regions are
    closer to each other. The KDE was plotted with a color scale to represent locations
    and observed values of soil data. For clear visual presentations, the plot concentrated
    the areas of soil data collection by using the top 25% of estimated density values48.
    The location of each orchard can be identified by its longitude and latitude,
    and this information was used for regional presentations of quality over time.
    The average fruit size and sugar content at each orchard were averaged for the
    following three time periods: the fourth and fifth weeks of October, the first
    and second weeks of November, and the third and fourth weeks of November. The
    temporal averages were plotted at the given longitudes and latitudes (Fig. 3).
    The observed trend of fruit size and sugar content with respect to each soil-
    and weather-related variable were visualized using smooth splines (Fig. 4). When
    the soil-related data were not available for the exact location of an orchard,
    the soil data were sorted according to the Euclidean distance from the orchard,
    and the averaged values of close locations were used as approximations. The regional-scale
    analysis was for descriptive purposes, and we state here that it was not for causal
    inference as the merged data were not obtained from an experiment. Inter-orchard
    analyses Farmers’ management practices are factors which distinguish between orchards.
    These are important as farmers can decide and control unlike weather conditions
    in open fields. Farmers self-reported their agricultural practices including thinning,
    mulching, spraying (pest control), fertilization, and pruning recorded from January
    to October in 2021. The frequency and time of each practice at each orchard varied,
    and the monthly frequency of each type of agricultural practice was visualized
    by ridge plot (Supplementary Fig. 1). For demonstration purposes, we randomly
    selected two orchards (which grew the same cultivar) and compared their observed
    soil conditions, agricultural practices, and fruit quality (Fig. 5). We then separated
    the fruit quality data by orchard (27 orchards), ordered the orchards by the median
    sugar content and median fruit size, and used boxplots to graphically describe
    the inter-orchard variability of sugar content and fruit size (Fig. 6). In order
    to visualize the longitudinal patterns of mean sugar content and mean fruit size
    by orchard, we used the spaghetti plots between mid-October and late November
    (Supplementary Fig. 2). To quantify the variation of sugar content and fruit size
    explained by orchard and harvest time, the R2 was calculated under the mixed-effect
    model. This statistical model accounts for similarity of fruit quality within
    orchards, and it is useful particularly when observed fruit quality values within
    orchards are correlated which is a reasonable assumption as shown in Fig. 6 and
    Supplementary Fig. 2. The ‘lme4’49, ‘lmerTest’50, and ‘MuMIn’51 packages were
    used in R for this analysis. In this mixed-effect model, the orchard was treated
    as the random-effect, and the time was treated as the fixed-effect. Two-sided
    p-values were calculated for the relationship between time and fruit quality and
    the p-values are adjusted for the multiple testing52. An agricultural DT can be
    more valuable when orchard-level variables can predict the fruit quality. In addition
    to the aforementioned orchard-level variables, the orchard-level weather variables
    (temperature, humidity, and air pressure) were considered for predictive analysis
    of sugar content and fruit size. To gauge the predictive power of these orchard-level
    variables, an automatic machine learning (AutoML) algorithm was implemented with
    the following predictors: time (week and month), the three weather variables (temperature,
    humidity, and air pressure), the frequency of each of the five agricultural practices
    (thinning, mulching, spraying, fertilization, and pruning), and the orchard index.
    The AutoML algorithm compared the predictive performance of multiple machine learning
    algorithms and automatically selected the best one. The AutoML was implemented
    using the ‘h2o’ package30 in R. The predicted values and observed values were
    plotted (Fig. 7), and the R2, RMSE, and MAE were calculated to measure the predictive
    performance. Intra-orchard analyses As aforementioned, one hundred trees were
    randomly selected and observed weekly in each orchard, and each tree was identified
    by a unique tag number. There were three levels of fruit position (low, middle,
    and high) determined based on the height from ground level. One fruit was taken
    from each position per tree per week, so there were a total of 300 fruit observed
    per orchard per week. One orchard was selected, and the hierarchical clustering
    analysis was used to group similar longitudinal trends for demonstration purposes
    (Fig. 8). In addition to the orchard-level variation (inter-orchard), we assumed
    that the tree-level variation (intra-orchard) is another level of random-effect.
    We added the tree-level random-effect to the aforementioned mixed-effects model.
    Under this statistical model, orchard and tree were treated as the independent
    random-effects, the time and fruit position were treated as the fixed-effects.
    Two-sided p-values were calculated for the fixed-effects and adjusted for the
    multiple testing52. The predictability of the inter-orchard analysis and the intra-orchard
    analysis were compared by plotting the predicted values and observed values of
    sugar content were visualized (Fig. 9). This comparison is to demonstrate potential
    benefit and necessity of tree-level analysis, in addition to the orchard-level
    analysis, for explaining the unknown source of variance in the fruit quality.
    Agricultural DT interface applet Data collection and analysis are not sufficient
    for successful individualized agriculture, and farmers shall monitor individual
    trees on a regular basis. In this regard, it will be convenient if a user-friendly
    applet provides summaries of one’s orchard (and comparison with other orchards
    in near locations) and a specific tree (and comparison with other trees in the
    orchard). For demonstrations with currently available data, we created an interface
    applet which is freely and easily accessible. If a user selects an orchard and
    then a tree of interest, the interactive applet provides the following information:
    (1) geographic location of the orchard, (2) regional soil components with RDA
    recommendations and comparison to other orchards in Jeju Island, (3) weather information
    with comparison to the other orchards, (4) agricultural practices with comparison
    to the other orchards, (5) inter- and intra-orchard comparison of sugar content,
    (6) inter- and intra-orchard comparison of fruit size, (7) inter- and intra-orchard
    history of sugar content, and (8) inter- and intra-orchard history of fruit size.

    Graphical Abstract Background Ticks and tick-borne diseases are major impediments
    to cattle production on a regional, national, and global scale [1]. Efforts to
    control native tick species in cattle production systems, and to prevent the introduction
    and spread of invasive tick species, require knowledge of their presence, abundance,
    and dispersal. The physical inspection of restrained animals for the presence
    of ticks is an important method for passive and active surveillance in regulatory
    programs. Surveillance data are used to identify which hosts are carrying which
    ticks, define boundaries of presence, and estimate rates of spread. Tick surveillance
    data obtained over time and space provide important information on trends in tick
    invasion risk associated with factors such as global trade, host diversity, climate,
    and land use [2]. The inspection of cattle is a key component of the Cattle Fever
    Tick Eradication Program of the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
    (US Department of Agriculture), which is designed to prevent the reintroduction
    and re-establishment of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus and Rhipicephalus
    (Boophilus) microplus from Mexico to the Southern Unites States [3]. The direct
    impact of these ticks on cattle production and on the transmission of Babesia
    bigemina and Babesia bovis were detrimental to the early development of the US
    cattle industry [4]. Cattle are inspected for the early detection of these ticks
    including those imported from Mexico, those in the Texas border counties of the
    permanent quarantine zone, and those sold at auction across Texas. The distribution
    of the Asian long-horned tick Haemaphysalis longicornis has expanded to 19 US
    states since its initial discovery in 2017 [5]. Its role as a vector of Theileria
    orientalis Ikeda genotype in cattle [6] is of considerable concern for US cattle
    producers. The expected range expansion of H. longicornis due to the interstate
    movement of cattle is of concern with respect to the lack of inspection and treatment
    of cattle [7]. The inspection of cattle and other livestock for H. longicornis
    has been carried out within a collaborative passive surveillance network in Tennessee
    [8]. Biosecurity measures undertaken in cattle production systems, including inspection,
    treatment, and quarantine, can prevent the movement of ticks associated with the
    movement of cattle purchased at remote locations and/or the movement of cattle
    between owned/leased properties. Preventing the introduction of ticks into a production
    system and their spread can also prevent the spread of tick-borne pathogens. Inspecting
    cattle for ticks is currently conducted by examining restrained animals by sight
    and touch. However, tick detection in this way is limited as there are areas of
    the animal’s body that cannot easily be seen or safely touched. In addition, the
    human sense of touch is limited to the detection of objects no smaller than approximately
    8 mm [9], which limits the detection of immature ticks and some unfed adult ticks.
    The predilection sites for tick attachment include the head, dewlap, axillaries,
    belly, udder/scrotum, perineum and tailhead. The inspection process is tedious
    and difficult, prone to human error, and dangerous for inspectors of range cattle
    [10]. New methods are thus being investigated to overcome the challenges faced
    during the inspection of cattle for the detection of tick infestation. Ixodid
    ticks blood-feed for days to weeks depending on their developmental stage (larva,
    nymph, or adult) and whether they drop from the host after feeding at each stage
    (three-host ticks) or sequentially feed through all three developmental stages
    (one-host ticks) before dropping from the host. While blood-feeding, ticks defecate
    onto the hair and skin of their host, potentially leaving evidence of their presence.
    We have investigated the structure and composition of feces from seven tick species
    using Raman spectroscopy and discovered species-specific signatures among adult
    ticks and evidence of signature differences between immature and adult tick feces
    [11]. In this study, we expanded the scope of previous work and report Raman-based
    spectroscopic evidence for the identification of 12 species of ixodid ticks based
    on the feces of their respective adults. We include an assessment of feces from
    the horn fly Haematobia irritans, an ubiquitous ectoparasite of cattle that also
    defecates on them while blood-feeding, and thus could confound the identification
    of tick species based on feces. We discuss potential applications for Raman spectroscopic
    findings for the identification of tick species from infested cattle and also
    the potential value of species-level variation in the chemical composition of
    tick feces. Methods Sample collection Feces from adult ticks were collected from
    the host’s skin and hair or wool for cattle and sheep, respectively, using standard
    rearing protocols. The feces of horn flies that had fed on cattle were sampled
    from feces that had been deposited on glass vials. The only tick species reared
    on sheep were Dermacentor variabilis and Ixodes scapularis. In all cases, protocols
    for the rearing of ticks and horn fly were followed as approved by the respective
    Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of each contributing institution and
    laboratory. Samples of tick feces were collected from the feeding chambers to
    which individual tick species had been confined when feeding on the host animals,
    and included fecal matter from numerous ticks of the same species. Samples of
    feces were placed in clean labeled glass containers, which were kept at room temperature
    before they were shipped to the Tick Research Laboratory, Department of Entomology,
    Texas A&M AgriLife Research, College Station, Texas, where they were stored. A
    summary of the laboratory source and host species for the fecal samples of each
    tick species and the horn fly used in this study is given in Additional file 1:
    Table S1. Raman spectroscopy A laboratory-built confocal microscope (Nikon TE-2000U)
    was used for confocal Raman spectroscopy. A single longitudinal mode laser diode
    (Necsel, CA) was utilized to generate light of a continuous wavelength (λ = 785
    nm). The laser was focused on the sample by using a ×20 Nikon objective (numerical
    aperture 0.45). The scattered light was collected by the same objective and directed
    using blazed direction grating (600 groove/mm grating) at 750 nm. A long-pass
    filter (LP02-785RE-25; Semrock, NY) was used for filtered Rayleigh scattering
    before the light entered the spectrograph. The Raman-scattered (inelastically
    dispersed) photons were captured by a PIXIS: 400BR CCD camera (Princeton Instruments,
    NJ). The spectra acquisition time was between 10 and 30 s. The laser power was
    set to between 7 and 7.5 mW. The tick feces samples were ground in a mortar with
    a pestle and placed on a glass coverslip for scanning. The horn fly feces samples
    were obtained from the glass vial by using a tweezer and placed on a glass coverslip
    for scanning. From 20 to 30 Raman spectra were obtained for each tick species,
    by using fresh fecal pellets of the same sample every three to five scans. In
    total, we scanned a total of 30 samples for reared Amblyomma spp. (seven Amblyomma
    americanum, 10 Amblyomma maculatum, seven Amblyomma mixtum, and six Amblyomma
    tenellum); 18 for Dermacentor spp. (seven Dermacentor albipictus, 10 Dermacentor
    andersoni, and one Dermacentor variabilis); four for Haemaphysalis longicornis;
    one for Ixodes scapularis; three for Rhipicephalus spp. [one R. (B.) annulatus,
    one R. (B.) microplus, and one Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto]; and two
    for Haematobia irritans (horn fly). Raman spectroscopy is a label-free, non-invasive,
    and non-destructive method for the analysis of chemical composition [12]. Through
    the use of a focused laser, the photons interact with chemical groups of the samples,
    which undergo a change in energy and produce inelastically scattered photons.
    The vibrational frequency pattern of the molecules is affected by the energy change.
    Raman spectroscopy is widely used in agriculture [12, 13], forensics [14,15,16],
    and other scientific fields [17,18,19] for qualitative and quantitative analysis.
    Through the application of chemometrics, Raman spectroscopy can be used for different
    diagnostic models, e.g., Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning can be
    used to identify different pathogenic bacteria [19]. Doty and Ledmev[20] demonstrated
    that Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify different animal species from
    the spectroscopic signatures of their blood. Farber et al. [21] and Goff et al.
    [22] explored the possibility of using Raman spectroscopy for the detection of
    Lyme disease from blood samples. Partial least square discriminant analysis The
    classification model was based on the partial least square discriminant analysis
    (PLS-DA) algorithm, and conducted in MATLAB R2020a add-on PLS_Toolbox (Eigenvector
    Research). All the adult tick and horn fly spectra were pre-processed before being
    input into the model. Pre-processing included total area normalization, baseline
    correction (automatic Whittaker filter, asymmetry = 0.001, lambda = 100), and
    mean centering. Latent variables were selected depending on the performances of
    different models. Chemometric algorithms including supervised and unsupervised
    models can be used to help analyze spectral data. Unsupervised models like principal
    component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to explore the
    similarities and differences among data. In contrast, supervised models can be
    used to indicate differences, with the aim of classifying the data based on their
    assignment. For example, a classification model like PLS-DA, support vector machine
    discriminant analysis, soft independent modeling of class analogy, and other models,
    can be used for the qualitative analysis of the dataset [12, 23, 24]. Results
    The average Raman spectra of the fecal samples of each of the 12 tick species
    were grouped by genus, subgenus or species as follows: Amblyomma (A. americanum,
    A. maculatum, A. mixtum, and A. tenellum); R. (B.) annulatus and R. (B.) microplus;
    Dermacentor (D. albipictus, D. andersoni, D. variabilis); Haemaphysalis longicornis;
    Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto; and Ixodes scapularis (Fig. 1). The overall
    pattern of the Raman spectra varied from near flat with low intensities (Amblyomma)
    to spectra with progressively declining intensities (Boophilus) to spectra with
    distinct peaks and troughs (Ixodes, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and Rhipicephalus).
    Each spectrum had a series of peaks that aligned with the vibrational frequency
    bands associated with either vertebrate blood or guanine. Peaks in each Raman
    spectrum (Fig. 1) were identified by alignment with vibrational frequency bands,
    and are summarized in Table 1 to illustrate the variation in fecal content and
    the ratio of known blood to guanine components. Fig. 1 Genus- and species-level
    comparison of the average Raman spectra obtained for Amblyomma (four species;
    blue), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) (two species; black), Rhipicephalus sanguineus

    (purple), Ixodes scapularis (green), and Haematobia irritans (gray dashed line).
    Raman vibrational frequency bands known to be associated with blood (red) and
    guanine (black) Full size image Table 1 Comparison of vibrational frequency bands
    for peaks of Raman spectra of fecal samples from 12 species of ixodid ticks Full
    size table We identified eight slightly variable bands that indicated the presence
    of components of blood and nine that indicated the presence of components of guanine
    in the spectra of the fecal samples of the six taxonomic groups (Table 1). All
    of the spectra of these six taxonomic groups had vibrational frequency bands that
    could be assigned to guanine, but only spectra of four of the groups (Rhipicephalus,
    Dermacentor, I. scapularis, and H. longicornis) were indicative of the presence
    of blood components. The vibrational frequency shared by all groups was that of
    guanine, at 653 cm−1. Different combinations of five of the six groups shared
    vibrational frequencies at 852, 1238, and 1393 cm−1. The vibrational frequencies
    at 752, 1007, and 1376 cm−1, which can be assigned to blood components, were shared
    by Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto, Dermacentor, I. scapularis and H. longicornis.
    To determine the ratio between blood and guanine components in each fecal sample,
    we used the 653 cm−1 vibrational frequency as a marker for guanine and 1007 cm−1
    for components of blood. All of the spectra were baselined and normalized around
    653 cm−1. The relative intensities at 653 and 1007 cm−1 indicated that feces from
    Amblyomma and the subgenus Boophilus were dominated by guanine, as shown by the
    molecular vibrations, whereas those of Dermacentor, I. scapularis, H. longicornis
    and R. sanguineus sensu stricto were composed of mixtures of guanine and components
    of blood (Table 1; Fig. 1). There were visible differences in color bewteen tick
    feces, as illustrated by examples shown in Fig. 2. The feces of D. albipictus,
    D. variabilis, H. longicornis, I. scapularis, and R. sanguineus sensu stricto
    tended to mostly comprise shiny black particles (Table 1). These samples contained
    components of both blood and guanine, with a relative intensity (653–1007 cm−1
    bands) > 0.5 but < 1.5. In comparison, the feces of A. americanum and the two
    species of the subgenus Boophilus contained mixtures of particles ranging from
    light tan to white in color. These contained guanine-like components; the relative
    intensity was > 4.0 (Table 1). Fig. 2 Sample variation in tick feces color for
    A Amblyomma americanum, B Dermacentor albipictus, C Dermacentor variabilis, D
    Haemaphysalis longicornis, E Ixodes scapularis, F Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu

    microplus at ×100 magnification Full size image We next constructed a machine
    learning model to identify tick genera within the data set. The PLS-DA algorithm
    was used for the classification model (Table 2). The adult tick feces spectra
    were imported into the model and preprocessed. Spectra were normalized by the
    total area to eliminate the potential influence of tick feces color. The automatic
    Whittaker filter was used to baseline the spectra. Finally, the spectra underwent
    mean centering for the algorithm; latent variable = 13 was used in this model.
    The model predictions were 98.1, 92.3, 100, 99.7, 100, and 95% accurate for Amblyomma,
    subgenus Boophilus, Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes, respectively.
    The loading plot for the top three latent variables explained 97.2, 0.98, and
    0.3% of the total predicted data (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Most of the data
    (97.1%) were differentiated based on their intensity even after total area normalization,
    since the loading plot shared a similar shape to the guanine-rich spectra. These
    results indicate that the genera could be identified by blood/guanine-dominated
    features of their feces. Table 2 Accuracy of the identification of ticks to genus/subgenus
    level using the partial least-square discriminant analysis model for Raman spectra
    data of feces of 12 species of ixodid ticks Full size table To further differentiate
    species within the genus Dermacentor, we conducted another analysis using the
    same model with the same preprocessing of data (Table 3; Additional file 3: Figure
    S2). The high accuracy of this model was similar to that of the previous one,
    and only one spectrum, that of D. andersoni, was misclassified as D. albipictus.
    The spectra of the three species of Dermacentor shared greater similarity than
    the other blood-rich spectra. Since the spectral data were normalized before being
    input into the model, the difference in spectral intensity associated with feces
    color would not have affected the model prediction. Table 3 Accuracy of all predicted
    ixodid tick taxa versus horn fly Haematobia irritans, and accuracy of the identification
    of three species within the genus Dermacentor, based on identification of the
    source of the feces using partial least-square discriminant analysis models for
    Raman spectra data Full size table The Raman spectra of the horn fly feces exhibited
    higher similarity to the spectra of feces of Dermacentor and Ixodes, which were
    characterized by high levels of blood components (Table 1). The broad peak at
    around 1350–1400 cm−1 includes the vibrational frequencies at 1348 and 1376 cm−1
    that originate from blood and the vibrational frequency that can be assigned to
    guanine, at 1393 cm−1 (Fig. 3). Next, we assigned our data to one of two classes
    (tick or fly) and input them into our PLS-DA classification model for prediction.
    The preprocessing method for these spectral data was the same as that used for
    the previous model. Our model had an overall 98% true prediction rate for the
    separation of tick from fly feces (Table 3). All 40 fly feces spectra were correctly
    predicted, but 15 of the 969 spectra for tick feces were incorrectly classified
    as fly feces spectra. This small proportion of misclassified data may have resulted
    from the presence of vibrational frequency bands of blood components in the spectra.
    Our loading plot (Additional file 4: Figure S3) was 98.4% for the total data.
    However, most of the data were differentiated based on features of the guanine
    vibrational frequency band. In addition to the main features of this, a peak at
    1007 cm−1 that was associated with a blood-like feature in the top three latent
    variables, indicated that the ratio between peaks was also important with respect
    to the differentiation of samples by the model. Fig. 3 Averaged Raman spectra
    of fecal samples from 12 species of ixodid ticks (red) compared to those of Haematobia
    irritans Full size image Discussion The application of Raman spectroscopy to measure
    the constituents of feces from adult ixodid ticks that have engorged on cattle
    or sheep blood provides a basis for the evidence-based species-specific identification
    of ticks that have infested animals. Tick feces deposited on animals during blood-feeding
    may provide evidence of tick infestation. The Raman spectra of feces from 12 tick
    species revealed unique vibrational frequency bands that indicated the presence
    of components of blood, guanine, and as yet unidentified constituents of the feces.
    Vibrational frequency bands associated with blood or blood-like components [11,
    21, 25, 26] and guanine or guanine-like components [11, 27, 28] have been previously
    reported. The PLS-DA models enabled the prediction of ticks to genus level, with
    an average accuracy of identification of 97% when differentiating between the
    six taxonomic groups in the present study, and over 99% accuracy when differentiating
    between three species of the genus Dermacentor. We previously reported [11] a
    true positive rate for species-level classification of four Amblyomma species,
    R. (B.) annulatus and R. (B.) microplus as 100%. Ten of the 12 tick species in
    the present study are representative of ticks commonly found on cattle in Texas,
    and the identification of cattle infestations with R. (B.) annulatus or R. (B.)
    microplus is essential for the state-federal Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program
    for the prevention of bovine babesiosis [4]. The lowest percentage of correct
    predictions at the genus/subgenus level in this study was 92.3% for Rhipicephalus
    (Boophilus) due to the three spectra that were erroneously predicted to indicate
    Amblyomma. As South Texas cattle are known to be co-infested with multiple ixodid
    species, species identification by Raman spectroscopy of tick feces has to be
    both highly specific and sensitive. The discovery that Haemaphysalis longicornis
    and Dermacentor andersoni can be clearly distinguished from all 10 of the other
    species by using Raman spectroscopy of fecal samples is similarly important due
    to their respective geographic ranges in the US and their roles as vectors of
    the pathogens that cause bovine theileriosis [6] and bovine anaplasmosis [29],
    respectively. The PLS-DA model predictions differentiating H. irritans feces from
    those of all 12 species of ixodid ticks was > 95%, indicating that the potential
    for confounding the identification of tick feces with those of the horn fly may
    be minimal. This is of significance because of the blood-feeding behavior of this
    fly and its overlapping distribution with those of the 12 species of ticks examined
    here. The spectra of H. irritans feces were not similar to those of the blood
    components of the ticks (e.g., Dermacentor spp.). A possible explanation for this
    is that the amount of blood imbibed per feeding event is 1.71 mg for H. irritans
    [30], while, for example, an adult female D. andersoni ingests up to 4000 mg per
    feeding event [31], hence the likelihood of more intense spectral signals from
    the latter’s feces after blood-feeding [30, 31]. The digestive processes of ticks
    and horn flies also differ [32, 33], which may also explain why there are differences
    in the spectral signals of their feces. Other blood-feeding arthropods that need
    to be investigated with respect to potentially confounding identification include
    the cattle-sucking lice Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, and Solenopotes
    capillatus. Two other arthropods, the spinose ear tick Otobius megnini and the
    stable fly Stomoxys calcitrans, will defecate on cattle during blood-feeding.
    However, they limit their attachment and blood-feeding to the inner portion of
    the outer ear, and lower portion of the legs, respectively, where other ticks
    do not normally attach. The primary constituents of nitrogenous waste in ticks
    are generally recognized to be guanine-rich products, whereas the primary nitrogenous
    waste product in insects is uric acid [34]. Guanine-rich feces play a role in
    water conservation, which is important for the water homeostasis of ticks. Hamdy
    [35] analyzed the feces of eight species of Haemaphysalis, and of D. andersoni,
    that had fed on rabbit, sheep or calves by using solvent extraction, spectrophotometric,
    and electrophoretic methods [36]. All of the samples were from mated females,
    with the exception of one unmated female and one nymph of D. andersoni. The percentage
    content in the feces across all samples was 1.4–9.3% for guanine, 2.0–15% for
    another purine, 0.1–1.4% for hematin, and 5.0–68.0% for protein. The protein content
    varied with respect to host blood meal, i.e., it was 13 times higher for feces
    of D. andersoni that fed on sheep than for the same species of tick when it fed
    on rabbit. Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship between percentage protein
    and percentage hematin across the nine species evaluated, and for the one to nine
    amino acids that were found to be present according to species and blood meal
    source. The production and composition of tick feces may vary with tick species-host
    combinations. However, little additional knowledge has been gained on the physiology
    and biochemistry of tick Malpighian tubules and their rectal sac, and thus the
    excretory processes and fecal products of ticks, since the beginning of the twenty-first
    century [32]. The findings reported herein support the potential application of
    Raman spectroscopy for the identification of ixodid ticks from their feces, and
    for the evidence-based study of tick species of infested cattle, and to increase
    our knowledge of excretory processes in ticks. In the future, we will undertake
    the complete chemical analyses of the Raman spectra of tick feces using liquid
    and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy to increase component identification,
    analyze the composition of feces, and to undertake quantitative comparisons within
    and across all 12 of these tick species. We will also evaluate potential within-species
    variation of the Raman spectra of the feces of ticks with respect to their geographic
    distribution, genetic characteristics of their strains, developmental stages (larva,
    nymph to adult) between three-host and one-host species, and differences between
    blood meals of different hosts. Future work should also include the identification
    of tick species from mixed-species fecal samples, the variable dynamics of tick
    feces production, and their deposition on cattle, and the evaluation of sampling
    techniques and sampling practices. Conclusions The identification of ticks that
    infest cattle by using scratch inspection is an essential part of tick surveillance,
    but is acknowledged to be an imperfect method. New methods that could be reasonably
    applied to improve inspections could potentially improve the surveillance of tick
    infestation in animals. Raman spectroscopy of ixodid tick feces deposited on host
    animals during blood-feeding may offer an additional method of tick surveillance.
    The spectra of the feces of the 12 species of ixodid ticks examined here showed
    species-specific differences in the relative intensities and composition of known
    vibrational frequency bands for blood-like and guanine-like constituents, and
    model algorithms based on partial least-square discriminant analysis showed a
    high level of accuracy for the prediction of rates. The results presented here
    should encourage further research to improve the identification of the components
    of tick feces and methods for their sampling, and to increase our knowledge on
    the causes of within-species variation that may affect spectral data and data
    interpretation. Availability of data and materials The spectral data that support
    the findings of this study are not publicly available due to their potential commercial
    use, but may be made available by the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

    estimated to be in the billions of dollars are attributed to plant diseases. Numerous
    agricultural diseases hamper the expansion of agriculture. Farmers anticipate
    diseases through visual symptoms in plants. In the most cases it is misjudged,
    misinterpreted, and frequently wrong. This leads to the unauthorised use of plant
    pesticides and chemicals. The catastrophic effect of plant disease is yielding
    loss and no harvest in some dreadful cases. Black pepper is a medicinal plant.
    Black pepper is referred to as \"black gold\" in Ayurveda. It is the most crucial
    component in Indian and other cuisines and has numerous medicinal and health benefits.
    About 80% of people in developing countries, as well as about 3% of people in
    developed countries, are inclined towards using medicinal plants such as black
    pepper to treat their alignments1. This is the main ingredient in many ancient,
    unani, and ayurvedic medicines, which can cure many chronic diseases like diabetes,
    high blood pressure, the common cold, cough, etc. Black pepper plants are affected
    by diseases such as slow wilt, quick wilt, phytophthora, foot rot and yellowing
    etc. It is a native spice of south Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and some forest
    states of northeast India. The countries with the highest black pepper production,
    including India, are Vietnam and Indonesia. There is a growing demand and requirement
    for better technologies to automate disease detection. Currently, pathologists
    and agriculturalists rely on the traditional laboratory method and detect diseases
    with the naked eye. Computerized detection of plant diseases is crucial to identify
    and detect the primary signs of diseases so that they can be treated. The scientific
    community has studied plant diseases extensively, mostly concentrating on the
    biological properties of plant illness. Plant diseases are unavoidable and have
    become a big challenge2. Crop production scales down due to influences of pests,
    fungal attacks, environmental effects such as an unexpected variation in the meteorological
    conditions, which escalate further losses. This encourages the practise of some
    cutting-edge techniques so that the diseases can be premeditated in the specified
    area for various disease variance. As a result, there will be less labour work
    and less time spent on conventional methods or waiting for an expert3. Plant diseases
    are dependent on specific environmental factors and soil culture. Intelligent
    techniques for identifying remote areas as well as adjacent areas would furnish
    a well-organised yield monitoring system for disease-ridden areas. For such circumstances,
    hyper-spectral sensors or thermography sensors could be brought into practise
    to limit human intervention and unreachable far-field areas4. The disease is visible
    because the crop has a patchy distribution throughout the field. For instance,
    studies of tomato leaves5, rice leaves6, and litchi leaves7 demonstrate how vulnerable
    plants are to infections8. The latest deep learning algorithm enhances the computational
    approach with precise disease identification and realistic output images. Several
    real time computer vision systems have been recently developed using machine learning
    algorithms and other computational methods. Deep learning techniques are the fastest
    adopted techniques that help in analysis and feature extraction of dissimilar
    types of data9. Deep learning is a very popular methodology in almost all fields.
    Recently, it has gained tremendous popularity in agricultural domain because of
    its accurate results. Most of the researchers are training their data with an
    artificial neural network to get well-classified results10. Convolutional neural
    network (CNN) or ConvNet and artificial neural network (ANN) are the most successful
    deep learning techniques that has been associated with various image segmentation,
    feature extraction, and pattern identification or design recognition tasks. The
    proposed work demonstrate implementation of stat-of -the-art deep learning in
    categorization of black pepper leaf diseases. The various diseases considered
    for the proposed work are depicted in Fig. 1. The dataset includes six prominent
    categories of black pepper leaf diseases those are Anthracnose, Early stage phytophthora,
    Slow wilt, Yellowing, Phytophthora and healthy leaves11. There have been numerous
    studies on different leaf and plant disease detection techniques. To our information,
    this is the original attempt to use transfer learning for the prediction of black
    pepper leaf diseases in early stage. The image dataset used in the experiment
    is collected from black pepper plantations from the districts of Madikeri, Karavali,
    Manipal, and Udupi region in southern Karnataka, India, and used as a “benchmark
    dataset” for the subsequent study. Figure 1 Black pepper leaf disease dataset.
    Full size image The important contributions made by this work are as follows:
    The proposed approach uses real-time images of black pepper leaves captured by
    various high-end electronic equipment: a Nikon Coolpix, a Sony DSLR, and an Android
    phone. The benchmark dataset is created and annotated under the supervision of
    an agriculture scientist. The state-of-art deep neural network convolutional neural
    network algorithms are used along with transfer learning. A sophisticated high-end
    model for an early-stage black paper leaf disease is suggested. The ensemble implementation
    of the state of art deep learning algorithm give better predictions and are better
    than working on any single deep neural network model. This is been observed with
    implementing model Inception V3 and implementing a combinative application of
    SqueezeNet, GoogleNet and ResNet-18 using transfer learning. The goal of any machine
    learning algorithm is to select the one model that can most precisely predict
    the intended outcome. Unlike single model strategies where we hope this is the
    best/most accurate prediction, we can construct ensemble approaches incorporate
    into account a wide range of models and average those models to build one final
    model. The ConvNets used are the faster image classification networks. The article
    is arranged as follows: The motivation of the proposed work is mentioned in Section
    \"Motivation\", and related studies are discussed in Section \"Related work\".
    Section \"Materials and methods\" deals with materials and methods. In this section,
    various stages related to data acquisition, data preprocessing, image segmentation,
    convolutional networks, and transfer learning are discussed. Followed by Section
    \"Experimental setup\", where the experimental methodology is discussed with the
    help of a block diagram. Section \"Result and discussions\" includes results and
    discussion, and Sect. 7 includes conclusion and discussions followed by section
    \"Future work\", where current limitations and future work are discussed. Motivation
    At present, there is a huge surge in the automation of everything existing in
    the world. There have been numerous studies on different leaf and plant disease
    detection techniques. Algorithms for machine learning are being applied to categorize
    leaf diseases. But the classification result is not accurate for a small dataset.
    There is a dearth of standard sets of evaluation criteria for leaf disease identification
    and classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
    transfer learning has been used to detect black pepper leaf disease. This work
    proposes deep neural network learning implementation with high accuracy in early
    leaf disease predictions. This experiment will encourage implementation of advanced
    technique in agriculture processes and reduce manual labor and overall cost of
    disease estimations. The data set created will also help novice farmer to learn
    about disease it’s variety and they will be able to apply preventive measure to
    save the crop loss at early stage itself. Significance of the given research work:
    1. Early stage leaf disease detection in black pepper. 2. Improved feature extraction
    technique for the black pepper leaf disease. 3. The given research work motivates
    contribution towards precision agriculture. 4. Encourage research in agriculture
    domain and usage of machine learning and deep learning for betterment of people.
    Related work Recent progresses in deep neural networks have made it possible for
    researchers to significantly correct the precision of object identification and
    recognition techniques. The CNN models used in automatic image recognition systems
    are particularly useful for detecting the onset of diseases at different stages
    of plant development. Barbedo1 discussed techniques for enhancing data that lessen
    the impact of the absence of image databases that can accurately depict the numerous
    illnesses and symptoms in a given image. But at the same time, they’re unable
    to replicate the majority of the practical diversity. This paper deals with specific
    lesions and patches instead of taking the leaf as a whole into account for this
    purpose. Too et al.2 elaborated that traditional machine learning approaches like
    support vector machine, multilayer perceptrons, decision trees and neural networks
    have historically been used to solve the challenges of autonomous disease recognition
    in plants. The study looks into how the quantity and diversity of datasets affect
    the efficacy of deep learning methods used in plant pathology. Barbedo3 elaborated
    that today there is a shift of technologies from traditional to convolutional
    neural networks, which are now the predominant approach that applies deep learning
    concepts. Ganatra and Patel5 projected a prediction model for classifying and
    detecting plant leaf disease detection using machine learning and computer vision
    approaches. Preprocessing, segmentation, and extraction of attributes such as
    shape, color, texture, vein etc. are done on the raw image of a leaf. Thangaraj8
    discussed one of the venerated deep learning techniques for accurately detecting
    plant disease with little to no plant image data, namely transfer learning. They
    used a deep learning neural network model built on transfer learning to recognize
    tomato leaf disease. The author has used available and real-time images of tomato
    plants to detect disease. Additionally, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), RMS
    prop optimizers, and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) are used to evaluate the
    performance of the suggested model. The result of the experiment demonstrated
    that the suggested model, which use transfer learning strategy, is efficient at
    automatically classifying tomato leaf diseases. Ghosal et al.9 have worked on
    rice leaf, which is afflicted by a number of illnesses at different phases of
    its development. The authors created their own dataset of rice leaves due to a
    lack of available picture datasets and castoff transfer learning to create a model
    of deep learning. The suggested CNN architecture, which is based on VGG-16, was
    trained and tested using data gathered from the internet in addition to data gathered
    from the rice field. A total of 1509 rice leaf images were tested on 647 other
    images. The suggested architecture was a success. Cross-validation is advised
    to validate results in future work. Devaraj et al.13 frazzled on the importance
    of image processing in the arenas of agriculture and disease classification. Automatic
    disease detection is modelled using image segmentation and feature extraction.
    Upadhyay, et al.14 operated on brown spot diseases in paddy plants. The classification
    model based on CNN is trained and validated on the three major classes. Such as
    healthy leaves, developed spot leaves, and early stage leaves. Saleem et al.18
    have performed an analysis of deep learning and convolutional neural network optimizers.
    The work represents an appraisal of a hybrid model for plant disease detection.
    A total of 26 different diseases fall under 14 different plant species that were
    classified. The authors propose that the Xception architecture, when trained with
    the Adam optimizer, gives high accuracy. Fuentes et al.27 accentuated the importance
    of deep learning based on recent advancements towards object detection and recognition
    system accuracy. Cameras with different resolutions were used to gather real-time
    images of diseased tomato leaves. The authors used Single Shot Multibox (SSD),
    a region-based fully convolutional network, and a faster region-based convolutional
    neural network to complete their work. Single-shot multiboxes developed by the
    combination of two different region-based CNNs are discussed. Numerous image processing
    applications have embraced the Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique.
    This covers a wide range of tasks, such as multilevel color image segmentation,
    face and lip recognition, illness classification and identification from plant
    leaf images, pedestrian segmentation, and many more. Chouhan et al.34 have worked
    towards bacterial foraging optimization for plant disease detection. The significance
    of optimization techniques for image segmentation is demonstrated in this paper.
    Author determined that among other optimization techniques Bacterial Foraging
    Optimization is best, which is a member of the class of algorithms inspired by
    nature. When handling complex data, the hybridization of the bio-inspired algorithm
    also solves the issue with conventional methods. While dealing image processing.
    Rakshit Khajuria et al.35 suggests that automatic detection methods are accurate,
    efficient, and save time when it comes to identifying plant diseases. In recent
    years, automation of plant disease detection has drawn more attention. in agriculture.
    Thus, the current approaches for leaf disease detection, segmentation, and identification
    have a great deal of room for improvement given the advancements in ANN, its family,
    and machine learning techniques. The benefits of using these ANNs in different
    ways to provide optimal or nearly optimal solutions are the main topic of this
    study. AI performs well in testing and training scenarios. ANN has a strong learning
    nature. These networks may route around missing data when they are scaled over
    several servers and computers. AI allows us to capture a larger image data set.
    Author didn’t review any data set in the literature. Author proposes that to identify,
    categorize, and detect leaf diseases, the interested writers might construct their
    own data collection. Chouhan et al.36 conferred on data repository. This article
    has contributed to the understanding of plant development and management. For
    the stated reason, twelve environmentally and economically advantageous plants
    have been chosen. Images of these plants'' leaves in both good and bad environments
    have been collected and alienating into two distinct classes. About 4503 photos
    of healthy as well as diseased are collected. In addition, writer anticipate that
    this work will help scientists and scholars create strategies for plant identification,
    categorization, growth monitoring, leaf disease diagnosis, and other tasks. The
    ultimate expectation is to have a better understanding of the plants that need
    to be planted and how to take care of them. Authors gathered the leaves of twelve
    distinct plants that are significant for the environment and economy. The goal
    of this endeavor is to gain a deeper comprehension of the plants that need to
    be grown and how best to maintain them. Writer anticipate that this research will
    significantly advance the development of automated techniques for comprehending,
    observing, and controlling plant growth. Additionally, they think that knowing
    enough about the plant that will be cultivated will play a big part in nurturing
    nature and need of the hour. Author also reasoned that plants possess an incredible
    resilience quality that allows them to heal themselves, which aids the ecosystem
    in combating climate change and carbon emissions. Chouhan et al.37 presented an
    autonomous neural network (NN) based web aided leaf disease segmentation system
    for mango trees. There were four main components to the suggested system. A digital
    camera with web access is used to take real-time photos of the mango leaves, a
    scale-invariant feature transform technique to preprocess the images and extract
    features. Third, the most different features are used to optimize the bacterial
    foraging optimization technique for the NN''s training. Lastly, the diseased region
    is extracted from the pictures of the mango leaves using the radial basis function
    of NN. An inexpensive, real-time web-enabled system that requires little human
    intervention for disease segmentation from leaf images is recommended. Researchers
    have introduced plant pathology''s underlying technology, artificial intelligence,
    and smart devices that provide the foundation for precision or smart agriculture.
    Allowing neural networks and algorithms with natural inspiration to combine their
    learning and optimization powers for the purpose of identifying and categorizing
    diseases. Using the web-facilitated environment in addition to agricultural applications,
    such as managing weeds, estimating soil moisture, classifying plants using photos
    of their leaves, estimate crop growth, and manage fruit and flowers. Introducing
    the tools and technologies used in smart or precision agriculture, such as sensors,
    drones, smart cameras, and the internet of things. This article proposes an automated
    approach for separating the fungal disease known as anthracnose from the mango
    plant''s leaves. The use of a camera equipped with Wi-Fi is advocated for the
    acquisition of leaf images in a real-time setting. Chouhan et al.38 articulated
    that plant growth can be improved by the real-time decision support system, raising
    the crop''s yield, quality, and economic worth. By monitoring plant development
    to maintain environmental balance, this also assists us in supporting the natural
    world. It has been demonstrated that computer vision techniques are crucial in
    many fields, including corporate analysis, agriculture, medicine, and the military.
    Precision or smart agriculture has demonstrated the dynamic nature of using digital
    image processing techniques to simulate human vision. To improve crop yield and
    quality, the concept discussed has made an approach possible to automatically
    prevent and monitor plants, cultivate, manage diseases, control water, and more.
    In this research, author have conducted a survey of the number of articles that
    use soft computing and computer vision techniques to identify and classify plant
    illnesses from their leaves. This work showcases the most recent ideas, theories,
    and applications related to soft computing and digital image processing techniques.
    Each of the several results has been covered separately in the given paper. Different
    findings, grouping them according to the stages involved in digital image processing
    have been taken care. The main issue discussed in the survey is the standard database''s
    accessibility about specific plant and disease conditions. The inaccessibility
    of the database discourages scholars and researchers from working in this area.
    The issue of database acquisition is another hurdle. The process of collecting
    real-time databases from the field in a variety of atmospheric circumstances is
    exceedingly challenging and time-consuming. The preparation of the image is another
    problem. Real-time images have several invariabilities, such as varied textures,
    background features, and angles at which the image is captured, among other things.
    Other issues include choosing the actual field area for taking the picture, choosing
    the plant, choosing the portion of the plant that is diseased, and choosing the
    disease itself. Another issue that needs to be addressed by the author is the
    choice of diseases and their symptoms that distinguish one from the other. The
    selection of a technique and ideas for creating a suitable system that performs
    better, takes less time, and is more affordable comes next. There are several
    relative issues dealing with real time raw images. The difficulty associated with
    uncertain real time data and implementation of smart computer vision techniques
    is applauded. Materials and methods Image acquisition In the proposed research
    work, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset is considered. Data were directly
    captured from the field with the aid of high-end electronic devices: a Nikon Coolpix,
    a Sony DSLR, and an Android phone. Images captured by high-resolution cameras
    in a variety of dimensions are transformed to a uniform size, typically 300 ×
    300 pixels. Since the gathered images have different sizes, it is vital to make
    them all the same size. A collection of 1800 distinct photos of diseased and healthy
    black pepper leaves were considered for testing. These pictures were taken at
    random for both healthy and unhealthy leaves. For each disease type, almost 300
    images were collected. Data collected from various region in Karnataka, India
    is depicted in Fig. 2. Figure 2a–i shows field scouting in the black pepper field
    with an expert. Figure 2 (a–i) Field scouting in the black pepper field with an
    expert. Full size image Image preprocessing The visual spectrum is sensitive to
    the cameras used for regular photographs. There are problems with recording live
    photographs, including the absence of a distinct and detailed border, an ambiguous
    background, symptoms of various disorders, variations in the lighting conditions,
    an unexpected brightness, a dull or cluttered background, and others. These elements
    collectively have a significant impact on image analysis. Real photos need preprocessing
    in order to fully analyze them. A ground truth image that is the region of interest
    is obtained using the grab cut algorithm. The initial step to performing the above-stated
    task was to mark the region of interest. To achieve this, we have used online
    image processing, the GIMP tool. Where we use a bounding box to mark the image.
    Everything outside ROI (bounding box) is considered as background and masked as
    zero, which is black. Next, these images are used MATLAB R2023a for further preprocessing.
    The code is written in python, importing suitable libraries. The Gaussian mixture
    model (GMM) is used to filter the background and foreground. GMM learns the pixel
    to separate background and foreground, considering the color pixels and the area
    outside the rectangular block to label the image to provide the ground truth image.
    Later, the division is made by implementing grab-cut algorithm, where the clustering
    method is used by clustering all the forefront images to one node known as the
    source node and all the background pixels to another node known as the sink node11.
    These pixels are hard-labelled based on their closeness to the source node as
    foreground and their sink node as background. The weight among the pixels is defined
    by the edges defined by the rectangle block. This decides the probability of grouping
    pixels in each terminal. The min-cut (minimum-cut) technique is used to further
    partition the image graph into distinct portions using the minimum cost function.
    Considering the probability of the pixels being next to the source node or sink
    node, the image is segmented, and finally, labelled annotated image data is obtained.
    Figure 3 depicts complete pipeline showing image processing-processing and data
    annotation. Figure 4. show sample Annotated (ground truth) images. Figure 3 Data
    acquisition and annotation. Full size image Figure 4 Sample annotated (ground
    truth) Images. Full size image Image augmentation Image augmentation is a method
    where the images are modified into a new form of the similar image. This is done
    to expand the training data set. Augmentation is used to represent a given image
    in various versions. Such that the images are flipped, rotated, and tilted to
    add extra records to the given database12. To artificially increase the training
    dataset, the given data is vertically rotated on the x-axis, modified at a 90-degree
    angle, and rescaled as elucidated in some sample in Fig. 5. This is achieved using
    python’s built-in functions while training a deep neural network. Figure 5 Image
    augmentation (a) Random reflection x axis (b) Random rotation (c) Random rescaling.
    Full size image Convolutional neural networks Feature extraction is the main reason
    for using machine learning for data organization. Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) is a type of machine learning algorithm that has been widely used for image
    categorization in recent years. These collection of algorithms in neural networks
    are termed as deep learning algorithms. These algorithms are the extensions of
    neural network processes. The convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically
    train the diseases13. Such systems are real-time deployable. Convolutional layers
    in CNN are followed by a pooling layer, an intermediate layer and further layers.
    There is an activation function in the pooling layer and between each set of the
    convolutional layer, Fig. 6. The input image was processed through a filter by
    the convolutional layer primarily, which modifies the pixel intensities14. The
    activation function helps in determining neurons’ states, which also sends a signal
    to the subsequent linked neuron in the higher layers. The convolution responses
    are shrunk down to a smaller dimension using the pooling layer. This layer can
    be used with a variety of pooling techniques, including maximum, minimum, average,
    and other types15,16. We have implemented a CNN to classify the black pepper plant
    leaf images based on disease categories and implemented max pooling (maximum)
    for multi class classification. Figure 6 CNN architecture. Full size image Inception
    V3 The recommended Inception V3 neural network architecture, is 22 layers deep
    with 27 pooling layers encompassed, depicting the stepwise execution details.
    It consists of a total of nine linearly stacked inception modules. Terminals of
    the inception module are connected to the global average pooling layer. The deep
    neural network is designed at the succeeding layer by replacing the last few layers,
    including the final layer17. For these layers, the learning rate is set high,
    to incorporate a faster learning rate into the newly formed (higher-level) layers.
    Inception V3 is employed to classify diseases in black pepper leaves effectively.
    Google Net Google net was designed and proposed by google in collaboration with
    numerous universities. Google net consists of many different kind of 1 × 1 convolution,
    average pooling to create deeper architecture. The convolutional network is used
    to reduce the number of parameters related to weight and bias so that small network
    can be build up18. The global average pooling used at the end” of this network,
    averages a feature map of 7 × 7 to 1 × 1. Thereby decreasing trainable parameters
    to 0 while improving accuracy of high class. The accuracy of google net is much
    more improved than its predecessors. SqueezeNet The squeezenet architecture is
    also designed to reduce the parameter of the original data matrix. It reduces
    the dimensions by using 1 × 1 convolution by the using the design strategy that
    normally squeezes the parameter and the design is termed as fire modules. Squeeze
    Net architecture are based on embedded system which are highly resource inhibited
    operations. The main filter used in this system is of size 1 × 1 and not 3 × 3
    that is used in most of the deep learning models. The fire model consists of squeeze
    convolutional layer which has filter of size 1 × 1 this is further expanded and
    feed into other filters that are expandable s this would expand to mixture of
    1 × 1and 3 × 3 filters. Squeeze net model reduces the input module to smaller
    networks19. This small network helps in reducing the size and increasing compatibility.
    Squeeze net requires comparatively lesser processing time, reducing CPU inferences.
    Resnet-18 Resnet stands for residual network. This network architecture is formed
    on the basis of VGG-16 network. But the layers in resnet-18 are short circuited.
    Figure 9 shows the circuit connection between the CNN layers. The concept followed
    here is to skip in between layers through short circuit connections. Hence this
    is some time called skip connections20. Which are responsible for further making
    residual blocks. Importance is given in mapping the residual block rather than
    the underlying layers themselves. Transfer learning Transfer learning is an approach
    that consists of domains and tasks. The domain comprises of two components. A
    feature space H is defined in the domain D with marginal probability distribution
    P(H), where H = {h1…, hn}, hi ∈ H. A task in given specific domain D, specified
    as D = {H, P(F)}, consists of two components: a labelled space G and an objective
    predictive function f: H→G. Now for a new instance h, the prediction of corresponding
    label f(k) is thru function f. That is task T = {G, f(k)}, is discovered from
    the training data consisting of pairs {hi, gi}, where hi ∈ H and gi ∈ G $${\\varvec{T}}=\\{{\\text{G}},\\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{G}/\\mathbf{H})\\}=\\{\\mathbf{G},\\boldsymbol{
    }{\\varvec{f}}\\left(\\mathbf{k}\\right)\\}$$ (1) When there is a known source
    domain DS and task to learn TS, a target DT and learning task TL transfer learning
    accelerate the acquisition of anticipated target function fT(.) in DT using the
    knowledge in DS and TS. The loss function generally represents the misclassification
    in predicted output to the input provided8. In transfer learning for classification-based
    optimization, the loss function is estimated as cross entropy. In machine learning
    cross entropy, is an approach used while the algorithms are developed to predict
    from the model. This is defined as given equation: $$\\mathbf{H}(\\mathrm{ p},{\\text{q}})=\\sum_{x\\epsilon
    X}p\\left(x\\right) Log q\\left(x\\right)$$ (2) Here in the given equation x signifies
    the total number of values and p(x) categorizes the probability distribution in
    the real world and q(x) characterizes the probability of projected value in predicted
    environment. Overall, defining the loss function for predicted class21. Transfer
    learning implementation details is shown in Fig. 7, in the form of block diagram
    with the flow of action. Figure 7 Transfer learning block diagram. Full size image
    Ethical and informed consent for the data used The data used in the experiment
    were all obtained by the first author through field scouting. Experimental setup
    In this study, we introduce an ensembled state-of-the art deep learning method
    for predicting black pepper leaf diseases. The process is carried out in two phase,
    first phase is data preparation and second phase involve implementation of deep
    neural networks for diseases classification. Images are collected from the field
    and annotated. The annotated/labelled images are used for the experiment22. The
    dataset comprises of 1500 black pepper leaf images. Out of these, the best set
    of images are chosen for each disease category, i.e., for anthracnose, early stage
    phytophthora, phytophthora, slow wilt, yellowing and healthy leaf images. Hence,
    a total 600 images are labelled and saved23. The leaf images are chosen such that
    the diseases are clearly evident with high visibility on the leaf surface24. The
    insinuation of diseases in black pepper is that they are specific to the given
    region, and symptoms vary from one region to another. Hence, care is taken to
    correctly identify and diagnose the leaf diseases. Figure 8 illustrate flowchart
    of the overall model. Figure 8 Illustration of the overall flowchart. Full size
    image Image segmentation is done using grab-cut method. Grab cut is a very user-friendly
    and powerful algorithm for extracting the foreground objects from a marked region
    of interest. Image augmentation is necessary for the deep learning models to run
    effectively during the training phase25. Image augmentation relates to image data
    scaling and rotation. More information in the form of data variation enhances
    the performance of deep neural networks. Gaussian Mixture Model is used for further
    filtering background object. Next, there was a need to import big data set to
    train deep neural networks so that these trained networks could be used for comparing
    and processing our novice data set. Hence, for training the CNN model, we have
    casted-off the most widely used image dataset, ImageNet. This repository has 10
    billion unique images in its library26,27. This is beneficial for training and
    boosting the learning rate of deep neural network at the initial layer network.
    This data is loaded at the initial neural network layer in order to pretrain the
    neurons. To prevent misinterpretation, we gathered and considered the images from
    a single input source (one device) during the processes of segmentation and augmentation28.
    Images are resized to 256 × 256, the size expected by the input layer of each
    deep learning model. Large data sets are necessary for the deep learning performances;
    hence data augmentation is accoutered29,30. These are considered the new databases
    for transfer learning implementation. Figure 9 represents CNN implementation and
    10 illustrates the flow of proposed conceptual methodology using transfer learning.
    Figure 10 embodies the conceptual model and the connections between implemented
    convolutional neural networks. Figure 9 CNN implementation for the proposed Model.

    for proposed deep learning implementation Contemporary state-of-art deep neural
    network are the best models to utilize for any given task. Based on its accuracy,
    speed or any other parameters of importance, a DNN (deep neural network) might
    be classified as SOTA (State-of-the-art). The majority of computer vision fields,
    though, involve a trade-off between these measurements. In other words, even if
    a DNN is extremely quick, its accuracy may not be up to mark. Sometimes we can
    create a model with acceptable performance metrics, but it doesn’t have the necessary
    latency or throughput for a variety of applications, such as picture categorization
    and object detection31. In CNN, features are extracted from training data using
    the convolutional layer. In this experiment, after meticulously training and working
    on new benchmark data set, four different deep neural networks: Inception V3,
    GoogleNet, SqueezeNet, and ResNet-18 are trained as state-of-the-art model for
    the black pepper leaf disease classification, using MATLAB R2023a software. First,
    the data is trained using Inception V3 individually with and without transfer
    learning, and the results are noted. Next an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep
    learning models that is GoogleNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet-18 are used with the
    optimizers; “adam”, “sgdm” and “rmsprop”. The hyperparameters used are data partitioning,
    loss functioning-batch size, initial learning rate schedule, learning rate, learn
    rate factor, number of epochs, validation frequency and bias learn rate factor.
    The activation function used is ReLU, which is the most prevalent function in
    a deep neural network. Our classification problem is based on multiclass classification,
    hence SoftMax is employed. The code is written in python, importing all the necessary
    python packages in MATLAB. Further these networks are fine-tuned and learned higher-level
    layers are replaced by new layer including max-pooling, for the benchmark dataset
    classification. We have used cross entropy for improved classification probability
    and threshold cut to avoid overfitting. The accuracy obtained through transfer
    learning technique is very high. The proposed data is classified into: healthy
    and a set of diseased images. The six-leaf disease classification include Anthracnose,
    Early stage phytophthora, Slow wilt, Yellowing, Phytophthora and. Performance
    of the ensembled state-of-the-art network is measured by confusion metrics. Not
    much work is done in automating early leaf disease detection in black pepper leaves.
    Our approach is one of a kind for black pepper leaf disease detection. The implementation
    of deep learning algorithm has increased the performance of the classification
    model both in terms of accuracy and processing time using transfer learning technique.
    This work represents early disease classification and prediction with state-of-the-art
    deep learning models. This work represents implementation of high-end algorithms
    towards the automation of agricultural unit for the benefit of farmers and people
    working in fields. This is also an attempt to contribute to society, as the results
    obtained can be used in precision agriculture in the future. The architecture
    of the proposed work is depicted in Fig. 11. Figure 11 Architecture of proposed
    model. Full size image Algorithm: Implementing ensemble state-of-art deep learning
    model for prediction of black pepper leaves diseases using ConvNet. Performance
    metrix The efficiency of the proposed black pepper leaf disease detection is measured
    by the confusion matrix. Which gives performance measures based on true positives
    (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). The
    confusion matrix is represented as in Table 1. Table 1 Confusion matrix. Full
    size table The performance that are computed through confusion matrix are specificity,
    sensitivity, precision, accuracy and F1-score. Specificity It is the performance
    measure, which represents the ratio of true negative to that of false positive
    and true negative. $$Specificity=\\left\\{TN\\right\\}/\\{FN+TN\\}$$ (9) Sensitivity/recall
    It is the performance measure, which represents the ratio of true positive to
    that of true positive and false negative. It is also equivalent to recall. $$Sensitivity(Recall)=\\left\\{TP\\right\\}/\\{TP+FN\\}$$
    (10) Precision Precision represents the ratio of true positive to that of true
    positive and false positive. It is also equivalent to recall. $$Precision=\\left\\{TP\\right\\}/\\{TP+FP\\}$$
    (11) Accuracy This performance measure is defined as the ratio of sum of true
    positive and true negative to that of total sum of true positive, false positive,
    true negative and false negative. $$Accuracy=\\left\\{TP+TN\\right\\}/\\{TP+TN+FP+FN\\}$$
    (12) F1-score: This performance metric is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.
    It is measure of the accuracy. Represented as given equation. $${F}_{1}=\\left\\{2*Precision
    *Recall\\right\\}/\\left\\{Precision +Recall\\right\\} =(2*TP\\}\\{2*TP +FP+FN
    \\}$$ (13) The hyperparameter values tuned for designing neural network are coded
    as follows: In order to fine tune our model, the hyperparameters are manually
    coded in python with given parameters. For training and testing two sets were
    considered with 70:30 and 60:40 ratio. But 70:30 gave better result and 60:40
    division was not a better choice. So, the result considered were for 70/30 sets

    and discussions We have used MATLAB R2023a for our deep neural network implementation.
    The software used to design neural networks is Python. For image preprocessing
    GIMP software is used. The deep neural network is customized accordingly to get
    better performance. This is done by manually adding layer-by-layer networks by
    dropping and adding network layers in the MATLAB R2023a deep neural network designer
    tool. The hyper-parameters, including normal network parameters, are added with
    trial and error to find the most suitable one. The main matrix values in each
    designer network are maintained as compared with the standard values. An ensemble
    of deep learning models is used for six black pepper leaf disease varieties. These
    leaf diseases are saved in different directories as a set of training and testing
    dataset modules. Figure 12 depicts MATLAB implementation of predicted Black Pepper
    Leaves Diseases (a) Input, (b) Output. Python code is written by downloading all
    the necessary packages required for the proposed model and functions are added
    to execute four deep learning models. These functions are in-built and available
    with the tool. Since we are using transfer learning, the proposed algorithm was
    first trained (executed) on ImageNet (online) data and then the last layers of
    these convolutional neural networks were replaced by a new network by simply deleting
    the upper layer and dropping a new upper layer. Then the algorithm was re-executed
    for the new black pepper leaf dataset. Table 2 shows the various hypermeters used
    in the experiment and their definitions and values. This is also explained in
    the performance matrix headline in this paper. Figure 12 Predicted black pepper
    leaves diseases (a) Input, (b) Output. Full size image Table 2 Hyperparameters
    used in the experiment. Full size table A comparative analysis is done with the
    other models given in the various research papers shown in Table 3. A comparison
    is also shown in Table 4 with the proposed model''s accuracy in the given experiment.
    The stage-wise steps are specified and explained through the algorithm: Implementing
    ConvNets, state-of-art deep learning model for prediction of black pepper leaves
    diseases. A total of nine different model combinations are made with three different
    optimizers: “Adam”, “sgdm,” and “rmsprop.\" The images are resized at the pre-processing
    stage as required by the deep learning model algorithm, i.e., 224 × 224 × 3 and
    227 × 227 × 3, etc. The learning rate used in the algorithm is between 0.001 and
    0.0001. Image augmentation and segmentation are done during the preprocessing
    stage. This helped in having better accuracy and an F1 score of 0.78 to 0.98.
    Ensemble deep learning approach with transfer learning technique resulted in high
    prediction of black pepper disease classification from 65 to 99%. This is seen
    with the Inception V3 implementation in both cases. Figure 13 displays Inception-V3
    performance. Tables 5 and 6 exhibit architecture layer details and analysis results
    of Inception V3. The performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning model is
    measured through a confusion matrix. The resulting confusion matrix in the MATLAB
    tool is shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Where the comparison is shown for training as
    well as testing data. Figures 15 and 16 demonstrate the accuracy graphs for the
    implemented models. The performance measure acquired by the three models “GoogleNet”,
    “SqueezeNet,” and “ResNet-18” is shown in Figs. 17 and 18. The values are computed
    through a confusion matrix. The statistic is displayed in Table 7. It is also
    observed that the performance of the deep learning models varies with the optimizers
    used. GoogleNet works well with rmsprop and sgdm. SqueezeNet works better with
    the sgdm optimizer. ResNet-18 results in high accuracy with the rmsprop optimizer.
    The proposed modified Res-18 outperforms all other deep models used in the experiment.
    Accuracy in percentage of predicted black pepper leaf diseases is shown in Fig.
    19. The output sample with execution time is shown in Fig. 20. But the outcome
    may vary for different datasets other than ImageNet and the proposed diseased
    black pepper leaf dataset. The efficiency of each available high-end deep neural
    network algorithm depends on experimentation and analysis. Table 3 Comparison

    the early diagnosis of black pepper plant leaf diseases with the comprehension
    of computer vision. This is the first attempt of its kind to detect black pepper
    leaf disease using a deep learning approach. The proposed technique helps in predicting
    early symptoms of various black pepper leaf diseases. The state-of-the-art deep
    neural networks are implemented successfully on the newly created leaf dataset
    with an accuracy of 99.7%. For this study, five types of black pepper leaf diseases
    were considered: anthracnose, early stage phytophthora, quick wilt, yellowing,
    and slow wilt, as well as healthy leaves. The accuracy alters with respect to
    optimizers used. Deep learning models work well when data is available in millions.
    ResNet-18 provided high accuracy 99.7% when compared with other models. This technique
    can be further developed as an app for smart phones. This work proposes a solution
    towards agricultural intelligence for predicting diseases remotely with the application
    of high potential deep neural network in precision agriculture. An automated leaves
    prediction system can also be used by non-botanical experts to quickly identify
    early plants diseases quite effortlessly. Deep learning can aid the task of remotely
    sensing fields where human intervention is vulnerable. In the majority of circumstances,
    the traditional approach to diagnosis disease is similar. This may lead to misinterpretation
    about the diseases if it is unknown. Which may further tip to uneven application
    of pesticides in the fields, resulting in crop loss. Though diseases can be predicted
    based on climate conditions, their symptoms cannot be judged. With the help of
    the proposed method early disease predictions is possible. This will aid in reduction
    of unwanted pesticides distribution. A web-based or mobile-based computer system
    for the automatic classification of medicinal plants such as black pepper will
    help the local population to improve their knowledge of medicinal plants. Future
    work In the future, region-growing segmentation techniques can be used interactively
    for profound disease spot detection in leaves. Bountiful advanced deep learning
    technologies could be explored, such as VGG-101, VGG-S, U-Net, V-Net, Yolo, and
    Fuzzy Logic, for leaf disease detection, classification and prediction. Zone-based
    or global feature-based feature extraction techniques could also be explored.
    Synthetically developed image data can also be used in future, provided the required
    input data is in few hundreds. Data availability and access The data used to support
    the given experiment are available on request through the first author’s Email.

    Abstract Contrary to popular belief, agriculture is becoming more data-driven
    with artificial intelligence and Internet-of-Things (IoT) playing crucial roles.
    In this paper, the integrated processing executed by various sensors combined
    as an IoT pack and driving an intelligent agriculture management system designed

    Article Open access 02 December 2022 Introduction The world''s population is heavily
    dependent on agriculture for food. Water is a crucial component of agriculture.
    The yields of crops like fruits, rice, wheat, and other staples with which a sizable
    portion of the world''s population survives depend significantly on the availability
    and management of water. While 85% of fresh water is used in agriculture, such
    a vital gift of the nature is becoming increasingly scarce1,2. A sizable population
    depends on agriculture in densely populated nations like India and China, where
    it generates the majority of the country''s income3. Contrary to popular belief,
    the agriculture sector is developing and becoming more data-driven, precise, and
    intelligent than ever. The rapid developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    and Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based technology have shifted from statistical to
    quantitative methodologies in virtually every industry, including \"smart agriculture\".
    Such drastic changes are fundamentally altering conventional farming methods and
    creating new opportunities alongside a number of challenges. Furthermore, there
    are enough opportunities to develop mechanisms for creating intelligent decision
    support and process control systems for better plant and fruit health monitoring,
    automatization of water sprinkling, resource conservation etc. In particular,
    it is important to investigate performance gains that can be derived by implementing
    popular, robust and optimized DL networks along with sensors, computer vision
    and regression techniques and IoT setups in an integrated mechanism. Given the
    foregoing, significant efforts have been made throughout the years to utilize
    modern advancements in AI and IoT to increase the productivity and efficiency
    of the agriculture sector4,5,6. In recent years, IoT, sensors, and machine learning
    (ML) / deep learning (DL) have been utilized extensively in the agriculture sector,
    particularly with regard to monitoring, process control, and management5,6. In
    order to create trustworthy decision support systems (DSS), IoT and ML merge sensor
    inputs7,8. These techniques have made it possible to use data-driven strategies
    to boost agricultural produce yields. In order to create robust DSS, ML platforms
    use data collected by sensors as part of IoT setups9,10. In particular, ML techniques
    combine historical facts with the current environment to produce precise forecasts
    and generate crucial process control decisions11. Both wired and wireless sensors
    are used in agriculture for a variety of tasks, including weather monitoring,
    self-watering, and other related tasks including monitoring the health of plants
    and fruits12,13,14. Such prototype hardware-software frameworks enable the fusing
    of the relevant technologies through which we develop better understanding regarding
    the assimilation of sensors, data collection and analysis, the creation of a testing
    environments for sensor fusion, and decision making15,16,17. Such a system designed
    for agricultural applications must successfully combine sensors in IoT packs and
    AI aids so as to increase efficiency 18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Developing a fusion
    of sensors for designing an agriculture management system for fruit cultivation
    presents a number of difficulties, including: Interface of sensors and devices
    or hardware components together into a common platform. Transmit and receive real-time
    information through Wi-Fi modules and obtain data analysis. Implement ML/DL algorithms
    for decision support including rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition.
    Control and monitor the integrated management system in real time. The present
    work focuses on the design of a precision agriculture setup with stress on the
    adoption of sensors, IoT, and ML to regulate water flow and process management
    so as to maximize crop yield. The description included here covers the design
    of blocks and sub-blocks related to methods for obtaining real-time data from
    different field sensors, displaying and providing analysis using an Android application,
    irrigation process control through an automated mechanism, rainfall prediction,
    and fruit health monitoring using certain ML techniques. A range of sensors, such
    as soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and air quality sensors,
    are combined as an IoT set-up. It drives an AI aided decision support system that
    enables the capture and monitoring of fruit health and the environment of the
    cultivation ground. Further, the system has the ability to utilize the decisions
    derived by the AI aided set-up for the control of an irrigation system which is
    used as part of an agriculture management arrangement. Sensors are synchronized
    using a microcontroller embedded system, and each dataset obtained from the sensors
    is sent wirelessly by an IoT device controller to a cloud resident AI tool configured
    for decision support and monitoring using an Android application. The key aspect
    of the work is the design and configuration of several ML algorithms, namely CatBoost,
    Gaussian NB, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with long short-term
    memory (LSTM) layer for rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring and recognition
    using CNN with soft-max layer, CNN with Adam Optimizer and PTM based DL classifiers.
    These provide area under the curve (AUC) scores as well as accuracy values under
    field conditions, and provide sufficient ground for the formulation of an integrated
    agriculture assistant for cultivation and monitoring of certain types of fruits.
    Further, we have designed a combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer
    using a CNN + LSTM and a multi-head self-attention mechanism (Section “Combined
    CNN+ LSTM +attention layer based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition
    system”) which has lesser memory requirement, is more accurate and requires low
    computation time. Experimental results show that the approach is reliable and
    robust, and the services are hosted using a web portal with a user-friendly interface.
    Related works A number of technologies have already been reported for the effective
    use of water using a range of methods and application of precisions aids in agriculture.
    A system reported in1 comprises a distributed wireless sensor network with temperature
    and soil moisture sensors installed in crop fields. The Zigbee protocol is used
    to manage sensor data as part of an automated drip irrigation system2. The pH
    and nitrogen levels in the soil are often checked. By monitoring the amount of
    ground moisture, the authors in3 reported the design of a mechanism that can assist
    an automated watering system. The temperature and moisture levels of the plants
    are measured by the sensors for moisture and water content4. The moisture sensor
    provides the Raspberry Pi to turn on the water pump and provide the plant with
    water if the moisture level is determined to be lower than the required level5.
    An IoT based smart irrigation system has been presented in6 which reports that
    the proposed system can regulate soil moisture levels according to requirements
    and that users may remotely monitor, operate, and gather data through an online
    website. A range of sensors are available for use in agriculture7. In8, the authors
    report the design of a technology that enables the automated, low-cost management
    of an indoor farm. For the Indian context9, suggests using Multiple Linear Regression
    (MLR) to estimate rainfall. Mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) techniques
    are used in the design of a model reported in10. The model forecasts the rainfall
    based on the data after the results are examined to determine the inter-annual
    variability and tested against the experimental yearly variance of rainfall. Rainfall
    models10, optimal microcontrollers11, IoT based control system12 and greenhouse
    monitoring13, micro-service frontend14, etc. are intricately related to precision
    farming. Some of the recent work25,26,27,28 have provided diverse approaches towards
    fruit-health monitoring and use of IoT and ML approaches for a range of decision
    making and support applications. Theoretical background Here, we discuss the theoretical
    aspects of different sensors, ML methods and related systems. Sensors First, we
    discuss about the sensors. The MQ135 sensor7,8 is a low-cost device and suitable
    for application in areas that deal with air quality and for detecting different
    types of gasses present in the air. MQ 135 sensor follows a sensitivity curve
    as shown in Fig. 1. It is a log–log graph and shows plot for multiple gases. The
    x-axis is the detected concentration of the gas in PPM and the y-axis is the RS/R0
    ratio. The equation of a straight line in two-point form is $$y-{y}_{1}=\\frac{{y}_{2}-{y}_{1}}{{x}_{2}-{x}_{1}}\\left(x-{x}_{1}\\right)$$
    (1) where (x1, y1) are the co-ordinates of the first point and (x2, y2) are the
    co-ordinates of the second point in the rectangular co-ordinate plane. Figure
    1 This Sensitivity curve of MQ 135 sensor. Full size image Let, y1 = 1.122, x1 = 10,
    y2 = 0.447 and x2 = 100. Therefore, from the sensitivity curve of MQ 135 sensor
    for acetone, the concentration in PPM for acetone is $${PPM}_{acetone}=159.6-133.33\\frac{{R}_{S}}{{R}_{0}}$$
    (2) where R0 is the resistance of the sensor in clean air and RS is the resistance
    of the sensor in a gas (acetone). Another sensor used is the DHT11 sensor. It
    is used to obtain the temperature and humidity values8,9 as our proposed system
    is designed to work in hot and humid conditions. The soil moisture sensor helps
    in moisture sensing by measuring the water content in the soil. The sensor has
    advantages like anti-rusting property and has a long power life. Convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of DL
    models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images
    and videos. These are inspired by the processing approach of the mammalian cortex21.
    They have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are widely used for
    various tasks, including image classification, object detection, image generation,
    and more. Here''s a brief overview of CNNs and their advantages: Architecture
    Convolutional Layers: CNNs use convolutional layers that apply learnable filters
    to input data, allowing them to automatically extract hierarchical features from
    the input images21. Pooling Layers: These layers down sample feature maps, reducing
    the spatial dimensions while retaining important information21. Fully Connected
    Layers: After feature extraction, CNNs often include fully connected layers for
    making predictions or decisions based on the learned features21. Advantages of
    CNNs Hierarchical Feature Learning: CNNs automatically learn features at different
    levels of abstraction. Lower layers capture basic features like edges and textures,
    while higher layers capture complex patterns and objects. This hierarchical feature
    learning is crucial for tasks like object recognition21. Spatial Hierarchy: CNNs
    respect the spatial hierarchy of data. Convolutional and pooling layers maintain
    the spatial relationships within an image, which is essential for tasks like object
    localization21. Parameter Sharing: CNNs use weight sharing through convolutional
    kernels. This reduces the number of parameters in the network, making it computationally
    efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with limited
    training data. Translation Invariance: CNNs are naturally invariant to translations
    in the input data. This means they can recognize patterns or objects in different
    parts of the image, making them robust to position variations. Adaptability: CNNs
    can be adapted for various tasks with minor architectural changes. Transfer learning
    allows pre-trained CNNs (e.g., on ImageNet) to be fine-tuned for new tasks, saving
    training time and data requirements. State-of-the-Art Performance: CNNs have achieved
    state-of-the-art performance in numerous computer vision tasks, including image
    classification, object detection, facial recognition, and more. They have been
    applied successfully in diverse domains, including healthcare, autonomous driving,
    and entertainment. Hardware Acceleration: There are specialized hardware accelerators,
    like GPUs and TPUs, optimized for training and deploying CNNs, making them practical
    for real-world applications. Algorithms for rainfall prediction ML/DL approaches
    are robust, noise tolerant, adaptive and provide automated decision support (Fig.
    2). A few selected ML algorithms are configured for the present task in view of
    the fast nature of processing and low demands for computational resources. Figure
    2 A typical machine learning process. Full size image In the subsequent subsections,
    all of the ML algorithms that are used in the work configured to carry out the
    tasks of rainfall prediction (CatBoost classifier, Random Forest classifier, Gaussian
    NB classifier, CNN + LSTM) are briefly discussed. CatBoost classifier CatBoost,
    commonly known as categorical boosting, is a free and open-source boosting toolkit
    used for a variety of tasks, including regression and classification. Figure 3
    displays the various applications of boosted trees for working with categorical
    variables14,15,21. Unlike other gradient boosting methods (which require numeric
    input), Cat-boost may handle category features. Cat-Boost uses ordered statistics
    about the goal. As a result, more generic models can be created with less overfitting
    and less significant hyper parameter adjustments. It''s easy to use and works
    with a wide variety of Python and R packages. CatBoost has been found to have
    the lowest log-loss value for test data on common ML datasets when compared to
    other boosting libraries like XGBoost and LightGBM. Figure 3 Architecture of CatBoost
    Classifier. Full size image Random forest classifier An example of supervised
    learning may be seen in the Random Forest Classifier (Fig. 4), which can be found
    in16,21. It is applicable to ML problems involving regression as well as classification
    and can be utilised for both. In order to achieve more accurate results when making
    predictions based on a specific dataset, the Random Forest Classifier makes use
    of a number of decision trees that are applied to distinct subsets of the input
    dataset. As the number of trees in the forest grows, there is a corresponding
    reduction in the amount of overfitting that occurs. When compared to other algorithms,
    its training time is significantly less16. Mean square error (MSE) is essential
    for performing regression and it is expressed as $$\\mathrm{MSE}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}}\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\left[{\\left({\\mathrm{f}}_{\\mathrm{i}}-{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)}^{2}\\right]$$
    (3) where, N is the number of all the data points, fi is the value returned by
    the model and yi is the model returned by the actual data points i. For classification-based
    problems, the standard expression used is Figure 4 Architecture of Random Forest
    classifier. Full size image $${\\mathrm{G}}_{\\mathrm{ini}}=1-\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{C}}\\left[{\\left({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)}^{2}\\right]$$
    (4) Gini index is calculated by subtracting the sum of the squared probabilities
    of each class from one. Gaussian naive bayes (NB) classifier A unique variety
    of NB algorithm is the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm21. When the dimensionality
    is high, it has a high level of utility. Even with little training data, it can
    function17 effectively. The Gaussian''s equation for NB $${\\mathrm{P}}\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{i}}|{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2{\\pi}
    {\\upsigma }_{\\mathrm{y}}^{2}}}{\\mathrm{exp}}\\left[\\frac{-{\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{i}}-{\\upmu
    }_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)}^{2}}{2{\\upsigma }_{\\mathrm{y}}^{2}}\\right]$$ (5) where
    P is the Probability function, σy2 is the variance and µy is the mean of the Gaussian
    random variable y. Architecture of Gaussian NB classifier is presented in Fig.
    5. Figure 5 Architecture of Gaussian NB classifier. Full size image CNN + LSTM-based
    classifier In particular, it is important to investigate performance gains that
    can be achieved by implementing popular DL networks along with computer vision
    techniques and IoT setups in an integrated strategy. Better performance, especially
    with real-time inputs, is anticipated for DL structures that can handle spatial
    and temporal changes in samples. The spatial information of samples, especially
    those from visual inputs, can be reliably captured by CNN-based structures, but
    features with time-varying characteristics are difficult to handle21. This is
    especially pertinent with rainfall prediction. Recurrent structures like the LSTM
    cells are thought to be effective for temporal properties21. Additionally, integrated
    and AI-assisted frameworks with the capacity to extract spatial and temporal variations
    when used for rainfall prediction on continuously captured on-field sensor data
    have relevance not only for the farming community but also for ecological conservation.
    Hence, we have used a hybrid structure of CNN (Fig. 6) and LSTM for rainfall prediction
    using sensor fed data. Figure 6 Architecture of CNN used for fruit health monitoring.
    Full size image Algorithms for fruit health recognition In this subsection, all
    of the ML techniques are discussed that are used in the fruit health recognition
    model. For fruit health monitoring and recognition, we have used CNN + Softmax,
    Adam Optimizer, ResNet50 and GoogleNet. CNN with softmax classifier layer Deep
    learning neural networks like CNN (Fig. 6), are frequently used to interpret structured
    arrays especially while capturing patterns from input images21. CNN contains several
    layers, each of which is capable of recognising intricate forms and details. Here,
    maxpooling 2D and Conv 2D are used. A two-dimensional filter is slid over each
    channel during a maxpooling process, covering any features that are present there.
    Conv 2D is a two-dimensional convolutional layer which helps in creating a kernel
    that is wind with layer input which helps to produce tensor of output, in other
    words, the number of filters that convolutional layers will learn from18. At the
    end, the CNN is terminated by a softmax layer which performs the classification.
    Adam optimizer with CNN Adam Optimizer, often referred to as Adaptive Moment Estimation,
    is a method for gradient descent. It is a very useful and efficient algorithm
    that uses minimal memory. It essentially mixes Gradient Descent with Momentum
    and the Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSP) technique18. The gradient descent
    algorithm is accelerated by the momentum algorithm using the gradients'' exponentially
    weighted average. RMSP, which employs the exponential moving average, improves
    AdaGrad. The two methods discussed above are combined by Adam Optimizer to inherit
    the advantages and provide a more potent optimised gradient descent when combined
    with CNN. PTMs We have also used PTMs ResNet50 and GoogleNet21 for fruit health
    recognition which provide better insight regarding the efficacy of DL based structures
    for design of smart agriculture assistant. Methodology In this section, we discuss
    the methodology of the design of the system. The description includes the design
    of the integrated IoT system, deal time database design, development of an Android
    app, design of rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring systems, full-stack
    web development and the formulation of a combined CNN + LSTM + Attention Layer
    based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition system. Each of the blocks
    are designed separately, tested and integrated. Further, the integrated system
    is validated and tested extensively to determine the performance limits. In the
    following sub-sections, each of the blocks are discussed with all relevant details.
    Design of an integrated IoT system Figure 7 depicts the system model, which includes
    both manual control of the system via a mobile device and the use of various sensors
    including decision support as part of an automated farming assistance system.
    NodeMCU, various sensors, including soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity
    sensors, and air quality sensors, LEDs, DC water pumps, and motor drivers make
    up the hardware. For data collection, sensors are inserted into a variety of locations
    in the field. The soil moisture sensor determines the volumetric water content
    of the soil by using some of the soil''s properties, such as electrical resistance
    and dielectric constants. Two probes are put into the soil to make up the device.
    The temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) are a multipurpose sensor that simultaneously
    reports the temperature and relative humidity. The air quality sensor (MQ 135)
    measures air quality in parts per million (PPM), making it perfect for detecting
    NH3, NOx, alcohol, benzene, smoking, CO2, and other substances. Organic solvent
    acetone has an impact on soil processes. Different agricultural and ornamental
    plants are adversely affected by acetone, which also reduces their size and damages
    their membranes. NodeMCU gathers real-time environmental inputs from various sensors
    and combine it, improving the system''s data logging and aiding the AI based automation
    strategy. The farmer needs the access to real-time data collected by various sensors
    and shall be able to take control of the motors as needed using the android application.
    LEDs are used to show whether the sensors are functioning. A Red LED placed close
    to the sensor will flash to show the system is malfunctioning if a certain sensor
    cannot read data or if there is a connectivity problem. Additionally, we can determine
    the sensor''s location based on where the LED illuminates. Figure 7 Block diagram
    of the proposed IoT system. Full size image Figure 8 depicts the proposed system''s
    flowchart along with the necessary combinations of various blocks. The WiFi module
    is first set up during development, and then our program tests to see if the sensors
    are working properly. If there is a connection issue or if the sensor is unable
    to read the data, the Red LED will indicate. Whether or not everything is functional
    will be shown by the green LED. The sensors'' data will subsequently be gathered
    and transmitted to the mobile app and Firebase database. The pump status that
    the program obtains from the app and database can be compared. If the observed
    pump status is 1, the pump will be on, and if it is 0, the pump will be off. Algorithm
    1 summarizes the process logic. Figure 8 Flow chart of the proposed IoT system.
    Full size image Algorithm 1 Working of the proposed approach Full size image Real-time
    database designing On the Google Firebase platform, a database is built to collect
    real-time data (Fig. 9). Every connected client receives a real-time synchronization
    signal of data that is stored as JSON (Fig. 10). To create a Google Firebase account,
    users must sign in with their email addresses. Following sign-in, one Firebase
    account is created in private mode. Before it can be connected, the NodeMCU board
    must change from private to public mode by altering a property. The second stage
    is where you can find the fingerprint address of the website. The address should
    be in the \"httpclient.c\" file of the NodeMCU library. The Firebase host address
    on the ESP8266 should be set to the IP address of the Firebase account. Figure

    the real-time data and control the irrigation system. The Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT) now manages MIT App Inventor, a web application integrated
    development environment that was first made available by Google. This open-source
    web application is used to establish a real-time data monitoring program (Fig.
    11). The Google Firebase platform is accessed by this app using the Firebase IP
    address and API Key. By entering these criteria in the mobile app development
    dashboard, all pertinent components (such as buttons, labels, fire-based, etc.)
    are used in the design of the app interface. When a mobile app is generated, an
    Android device scans its QR code in the APK file to install it. Figure 11 Architecture
    of the Android app development in MIT App Inventor. Full size image Rainfall prediction
    The goal of the rainfall prediction model (Fig. 12) is to preserve water by using
    ML to accurately forecast rainfall, prepare for contingencies, manage irrigation
    facilities and use the rainwater if water supplies are scarce. The forecast for
    the rainfall is based on a weather dataset from Kaggle. Once the data has been
    read into Jupyter Notebook, missing values for all categorical and numerical variables
    are handled using level encoding, median, get dummies, and random imputation.
    Outliers are also eliminated from the data box plot. The categorical variables
    \"Rain Tomorrow\" and \"Date\" are selected for training and testing after data
    analysis. Several methods, including CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier,
    Gaussian NB, and CNN + LSTM network, are used to calculate the AUC and accuracy
    score. The trained networks are fed with sensor data to provide relevant real-time
    responses. Figure 12 Block diagram of rainfall prediction model. Full size image
    A web resident functionality provides indication of weather condition and rain
    forecast of a locality. The \"Predictor Section,\" provides the rainfall forecasting.
    The user can enter several input factors for a certain day that are necessary
    for determining whether it will rain or not. Date, highest and lowest temperatures,
    evaporation, sunshine, wind gust speed, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud
    at specific time are some of the input factors. The user must select the \"Predict\"
    option after entering the required parameters (Table 1) in order to forecast the
    amount of precipitation. Table 1 Parameters used in rainfall prediction model.
    Full size table Fruit health recognition Fruit health recognition system (Fig.
    13) is designed with a view to distinguish fresh fruits from rotten fruits. The
    overall productivity and profitability would suffer if rotten fruits are stored
    along with the fresh fruits as the rotten ones will damage the fresh ones. Fruit
    recognition system is useful in mitigating this issue. Figure 13 Block diagram
    of fruit health recognition model. Full size image Here in this model, three different
    fruits are used: Bananas, Apples and Oranges. Rotten and fresh images for all
    three are collected (Fig. 14). For each class there are at least three different
    varieties in shape and two in colour. The size of the database is 4200 images
    of which 50% are used for training and the remaining for validation and training.
    Further, two illumination and three resolution captures are added which augmented
    the data size significantly. Figure 14 Portion of the sample images taken for
    training, validation and testing of fruit health recognition model. Full size
    image The paper contains the preprocessing steps involving standardization, normalization,
    and rescaling of the images regarding the novelty of the work. Normalization is
    applied here to scale the pixel values of the images to a common range, typically
    between 0 and 1. This helps ensure that the model trains effectively without being
    influenced by the varying pixel value scales in different images. It is necessary
    to establish a benchmark standard for designing and testing the complete system
    based on AI techniques. One the system is validated, the normalization process
    is not required. We have calculated the mean and standard deviation of pixel values
    across the entire dataset and we have used these statistics to normalize each
    image. The formula for normalization is $${\\text{Normalization}} = \\left( {{\\text{Pixel
    Value}} - {\\text{Mean}}} \\right)/{\\text{Standard Deviation}}$$ (6) After normalization
    the pixel values are in a consistent range, reducing the likelihood of vanishing
    or exploding gradients during training. Also the model can learn faster and generalize
    better. The impact of rescaling involves resizing the images to a common and manageable
    size. It''s essential for models that require fixed input dimensions, such as
    CNNs. For the procedure of rescaling we have resized each image to a specified
    target size, e.g., 300 × 300 pixels. When resizing, we have maintained the aspect
    ratio to avoid distortion. The benefits of rescaling ensures that all images have
    the same dimensions, making them compatible with models like CNNs and also reduces
    computational complexity and memory requirements, especially for deep learning
    models. In order to increase the number of images on the dataset, data augmentation
    on the existing images is performed. In the Jupyter Notebook, various modules
    such as TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Pyplot and Seaborn are uploaded. Dataset
    is divided into training and testing dataset. Maxpooling 2D, Conv 2D and Adam
    optimizer are implemented as part of the popular CNN structure. Accuracy and validation
    scores of the model are obtained and a graph is plotted between training and validation
    accuracy and losses. Table 2 summarizes the different parameters used in the design
    of the fruit health recognition system. A webpage is deployed that provides an
    interface to the user for fruit health recognition, from where the prediction
    regarding the condition of the fruit is done. We have used TensorFlow as the deep
    learning framework for building and training our fruit health recognition model.
    Table 2 Parameters used in fruit health recognition model. Full size table The
    parameter selection of the training and dataset are based on the following considerations:
    Deep learning framework—TensorFlow Image_Size = 300 × 300 The images in our dataset
    have been resized to 300 × 300 pixels to fulfill the requirements of training
    the AI system. Batch_Size = 32 During training, the model processes data in batches,
    with each batch containing 32 images. Channels = 3 (RGB) The images in our dataset
    are in RGB format, with each image having three color channels (Red, Green, and
    Blue). Epochs = 35, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 35 number of passes are used We have
    specified a range of epochs for training the model. Each epoch represents one
    pass through the entire training dataset. It appears that our plan to train the
    model for different numbers of epochs to assess its performance. Data size = 4500
    images augmented with two illuminations and three resolutions The dataset consists
    of 4,500 images. Additionally, data augmentation techniques have been applied,
    including variations in illumination and three different resolutions. Data augmentation
    is a valuable technique for increasing the diversity of the training data. Gaussian
    NB classifier However, in the context of deep learning and image recognition,
    deep neural networks, particularly CNNs, are typically used instead of Gaussian
    NB. CNNs are better suited for image-based classification tasks21. Size of the
    training dataset = 50% Half (50%) of the dataset is allocated for training the
    model. This is a common practice, as it allows the model to learn from a substantial
    portion of the data. Size of the validation dataset = 25% A quarter (25%) of the
    dataset is allocated for validation. The validation dataset is used to assess
    the model''s performance during training and to tune hyper parameters. With these
    parameters, we have proceeded with training the fruit health recognition model
    using TensorFlow. However, the use of CNNs instead of Gaussian NB is necessitated
    for the requirements of better performance in case fruit health classification
    tasks. Additionally, monitoring the model''s performance on the validation set
    during training is used to make informed decisions about model architecture and
    hyper parameter tuning. The parameters used in fruit health recognition model
    is given in Table 2. Full-stack web development For the proposed work, three full-stack
    websites are developed that includes all the aspects of the work. Technologies
    employed for the web development include: For Front-End—HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    etc. For Back-End – Flask. Agricultural management system website The main website
    is created with the title ‘Agricultural Management System’. A navigation bar is
    created with different contents from where user can navigate to the different
    sections of the website like “About”, “Services” that are offered, “Contact” to
    the Developers etc. The most important section “Services” consists of different
    features like Weather Forecasting, Fruit Health Recognition, APK for real-time
    data monitoring and irrigation, online education platform etc. The farming-based
    online education platform, which is presently under development, requires users
    to sign up and pay to enroll. The main website is linked to two other websites:
    Rainfall Prediction and Fruit Recognition. The user will be redirected to the
    appropriate website when they select the option for weather forecasting or fruit
    health recognition. Rainfall prediction website A website is created with the
    title ‘Rainfall Predictor’ using HTML, CSS (front-end) and Flask (back-end). From
    the main website, the Rainfall Predictor website can be accessed directly by clicking
    “Weather Forecasting option”. A navigation bar is created with different contents
    from where user can navigate to the different sections of the website like “Home”,
    “About Rainfall Predictor”, “Dashboard”, “Developers” and the “Predictor” section
    from where the actual prediction is done. The webpage contains a dashboard which
    provides graphical representation of the parameters. The user can contact to the
    developers by navigating into the Developer section. Fruit recognition web service
    A web service is created with the title ‘Fruit Recognition’ using HTML, CSS (front-end)
    and Flask (back-end). From the main website, the fruit recognition website can
    be accessed directly by clicking “Fruit Health”. A navigation bar is created with
    different contents from where user can navigate to the different sections of the
    website like “Home”, “About” the website, “Contact” and the “Predictor” section
    from where the actual prediction is done. The main feature is the ‘Prediction
    Section’ from where the actual prediction regarding the condition of the fruit
    is determined. The user in order to identify the condition of the fruit has to
    go to the prediction section in the navigation bar from where images of the fruits
    present in the directory are selected and after selecting the images the user
    has to click the submit button and the result is displayed featuring the condition
    of the fruits (fresh or rotten) as well as the confidence percentage. The user
    can also contact to the developers regarding any query or issue by switching to
    the “Contact” section in the navigation bar. Combined CNN + LSTM + attention layer
    based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition system The above methods
    discussed provide the opportunity to explore the performance improvements that
    may be achieved by combining the CNN, LSTM and a multi head (MA) self-attention
    (SA) mechanism (Figs. 15, 16) in a composite framework (Fig. 15) for both forecast
    of rain and discrimination of fruit health. The mix of CNN, LSTM, and the SA mechanisms
    emerges out to be effective at discrimination tasks in a variety of areas29,30,31
    that include natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing,
    etc. Let''s look at how each part of the system contributes to the effectiveness
    of the whole framework. Figure 15 Cloud resident composite CNN + LSTM + attention
    mechanism for rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition. Full size image
    Figure 16 Multi head sectoral attention mechanism. Full size image The CNNs are
    utilized extensively for many tasks including the processing of images and texts.
    In the field of computer vision, CNNs are particularly useful at capturing hierarchical
    representations and small spatial patterns. They are made up of convolutional
    layers, which are followed by pooling layers, and they aid in the process of extracting
    useful characteristics from incoming data. CNNs are good at distinguishing between
    visual or sequential patterns, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as
    the classification of images and the identification of objects21. The LSTM networks
    are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that perform well in the processing
    of sequential data, such as natural language sentences or time series. By combining
    a memory cell with input, forget, and output gates, LSTMs are able to accurately
    represent long-term dependence. This is made possible by the memory cell. Because
    of this architecture, LSTMs are able to remember information over time or forget
    it over time, which enables them to effectively handle sequential patterns that
    occur over a wide range of time scales. LSTMs are very helpful for activities
    such as analysing sentiments, translating languages, predicting time varying data
    and events, recognizing voices etc.21. The SA mechanism, often referred to as
    the transformer architecture, has received a great deal of interest in recent
    years for its application in a variety of tasks that require special focus on
    specific areas of input patterns. The model is able to listen to different parts
    of the input sequence thanks to the self-attention capability, which also allows
    it to capture the dependencies that exist between words or tokens21. Calculating
    attention weights between all possible pairings of places in the input sequence,
    then computing a weighted sum of those attention weights to produce a context
    vector for each position, is what this function does. Because of this technique,
    the model is able to concentrate on the parts of the sequence that are the most
    important, which results in improved discrimination and an effective capturing
    of long-range relationships. The combined model is able to take advantage of the
    benefits that are offered by each component namely CNN, LSTM, and Self-Attention
    processes. For instance, in an image classification challenge, the model might
    utilize the advantages of the CNN to extract local features and patterns from
    pattern embeddings, LSTMs to capture the sequential dependencies, and Self-Attention
    to attend to key sections of the sequence while taking into consideration the
    overall context of the problem. By utilising both the local and the global information
    that is contained within the input data, this combination enables the model to
    efficiently differentiate between the many groups or categories that are there.
    As shown in Fig. 16, for the proposed approach has provision for using sensor
    data and image inputs. For the sensor data, there are actual and delayed feeds
    to retain the temporal context. Next, a block of 1D- convolutional (8 no.s) fed
    by 3 × 3 masks an dlinked to batach normalization (BN), rectified linear unit
    (ReLU) and max pooling (MPool) feeds another such block.It is followed by an attention
    layer (detailed layout Fig. 17) which drives another 1D conv + BN + ReLU + LSTM
    layers which dirve a MH-SA and a LSTM layer. This is followed by fully connected
    (FC) layers and ends at softmax block. For the image imputs, two blocks of 2D
    conv (16 with 3 × 3 masks) + BN + ReLU + MPool drives a FC layer which after a
    few more FC blocks ends in a softmax layer. Figure 17 Architecture of the proposed
    agricultural management system. Full size image Experimental set-up The experimental
    set-up is formed by the IoT and ML methods as part of an agriculture farm management
    system (Fig. 17). The system is designed using NodeMCU and cloud computing and
    provides assistance to the farmers in monitoring soil moisture, air quality, humidity,
    and temperature as well as helps in predicting rainfall and fruit health conditions.
    As already mentioned, the sensors are connected to the same NodeMCU platform (ESP
    8266) and the data gathered from sensors are stored in a database in real-time.
    The ESP 8266 is connected to a nearby Wi-Fi network in order to establish a connection
    with the database''s web server. The data can be downloaded from the real-time
    database and shown on the Android mobile app. MIT App Inventor is used to create
    the Android application. Depending on the user input through the pump controller,
    the app can use Boolean data (0 or 1) to convey the pump control status to the
    real-time database. The NodeMCU sends the command to the motor driver in order
    to regulate the irrigation process by retrieving the Boolean data from a real-time
    database. From Kaggle, a weather dataset is obtained and examined. In order to
    clean up the dataset and increase its value, the numerical, continuous, and categorical
    variables are separated, and each variable is then subjected to analysis. Following
    that, box-plot graphs are generated to exclude outliers and provide a visual representation
    of the probability distribution of the data. Popular algorithms—CatBoost, Gaussian
    NB, and Random Forest Classifier and CNN + LSTM network—are used to forecast the
    best model for rainfall prediction after organizing the data and training. Further,
    a combined CNN + LSTM + Attention Layer based rainfall prediction and fruit health
    recognition system is designed which provides an integrated approach. The performance
    of this system is compared with the bench mark methods namely Cat-Boost, Gaussian
    NB, and Random Forest Classifier and CNN + LSTM network. Access to the web-server
    for these cloud resident tools is through an easy-to-use interface where the user
    may enter the criteria needed to predict when it will rain. Same is the case with
    fruit health monitoring. Results and discussion In this section, we discuss the
    results derived and the related details. Performance of the IoT set-up The primary
    programming code file is uploaded to the NodeMCU board using a USB cable after
    all hardware components have been installed. All findings are validated by looking
    at the serial monitor window. By manually disconnecting the DHT 11 sensor, the
    functionality of LED indicators is examined. It is confirmed that if the sensor
    is not connected to the microcontroller board, a red LED will light up, and a
    green LED will light up if all connections are sound. Figure 18 shows an experimental
    set-up of the system. Figures 19 and 20 show how all data are received and shown
    in the Android application monitor pane and Google Firebase real-time database.
    The water pump status is also checked by clicking ON/OFF button of pump controller
    in the Android application. Figure 18 Experimental setup of the proposed IoT system.

    The sensors data are acquired and displayed in the mobile application. The monitor
    window shows the temperature, humidity, soil moisture and air quality (presence
    of acetone) information at two particular instants, in presence of acetone and
    in absence of acetone as shown in Fig. 19. Although acetone occurs naturally in
    the environment in plants, trees, volcanic gases, forest fires, the majority of
    the acetone released into the environment is of industrial origin. Acetone condensation
    products reported to have growth regulating properties for their effects on seed
    germination. It means that acetone measurement is crucial for agricultural lands
    nearer to the industrial areas. Table 3 shows sensor reading at certain reading
    instants. Table 3 Sensors’ readings at different time instants. Full size table
    User can also perform manual controlling of the motor through the mobile application
    based on the parameter measured. Table 4 shows certain expert inputs leading to
    the formulation of a decision logic derived out of the sensor readings. Table

    A few algorithms are implemented and their AUC as well as accuracy score are checked.
    CatBoost The following algorithm suits the model perfectly as because it gives
    an accuracy score of 0.86 and AUC score of 0.89 as shown in Fig. 21. Figure 21
    Experimental result of CatBoost classifier. Full size image Random forest This
    algorithm suits the model but it has less accuracy and AUC score than CatBoost
    algorithm but it can also predict rainfall pretty well as shown in Fig. 22. Figure
    22 Experimental result of Random Forest classifier. Full size image Gaussian NB
    This is the least accurate model as both the AUC as well as the accuracy score
    are less than both CatBoost and Random Forest classifier as shown in Fig. 23.
    Figure 23 Experimental result of Gaussian NB classifier. Full size image Similarly,
    the CNN in the VGG16 configuration21 with LSTM layer at the end is trained with
    sensor data of two weeks and validated (Fig. 24). All the data are analyzed and
    summary outlined in Table 5. Figure 24 Root mean square and loss function values
    of the CNN + LSTM model used for rainfall prediction. Full size image Table 5
    Summary results representing the AUC and accuracy score derived for rainfall prediction.
    Full size table As shown in Table 5, among the different prediction techniques,
    the CNN + LSTM and Cat-Boost yield the best accuracies. However, CatBoost classifier
    has a higher memory usage and performs better when categorical data is available.
    Further, random forest classifier has greater processing criticality and requires
    long training times. Similarly, the Gaussian NB classifier assumes feature independence,
    an unrealistic consideration in case of real-world data. Moreover, the Gaussian
    NB classifier encounters the zero-probability situation which provides erroneous
    outcomes. Therefore, the CNN + LSTM combination is selected for the predicting
    the rainfall. Rainfall prediction After data augmentation, the graph is plotted
    featuring training and validation accuracy and training and validation loss. The
    blue line in Fig. 25 represents the training part and orange line represent validation
    part. The worst case (trained with a data set and tested with a sequence with
    illumination and resolution variation) accuracy is found out to be 89.38% and
    loss score is found out to be 0.3168 as shown in Fig. 25. The experimental results
    are shown in Fig. 26 obtained from the CNN + Softmax combination. Table 6 featuring
    the actual and the predicted identities along with confidence percentage obtained
    using a CNN classifier shows the reliability of the approach. Similar set of results
    are obtained for the other classifiers as well (CNN with Adam Optimizer, ResNet50
    and GoogLeNet). This is shown in Table 7. Figure 25 Experimental result of CNN + Softmax

    system. Full size table Interface of the websites A cloud-based service has been
    made available for online testing. Figures 27 and 28 show the screenshots of the
    web-interfaces. Cultivators of different parts of the north-east Indian state
    of Assam have been invited to use the services of the cloud resident app. The
    cultivators experienced latency in responses which varied with time and location.
    It is dependent on wireless coverage. But the accuracy obtained is as reported
    above. The impact of the system is associated with the fact that the buyer–seller
    relationship can be reinforced with the help of the system which has been made
    available for testing using the web-interface. Figure 27 Agricultural Management
    System website home page. Full size image Figure 28 Home page of fruit recognition
    website. Full size image Comparison with previous work and discussion A description
    of certain statistical indicators for predicting rainfall, identifying fruit health,
    and comparing current results is shown in Table 8. Additionally, it covers the
    memory requirements for each of the techniques applied in the work. We have taken
    into account categorical (17), continuous (14), discrete (2), and numerical (16)
    characteristics. Integers and floats are represented using numerical characteristics.
    Only one value can be used for discrete characteristics. There is a range of values
    for continuous features. Levels, or values, can be assigned to categorical features.
    In case of rainfall prediction, even though the CNN + LSTM combination requires
    more memory (than Gaussian NB Classifier) but lower than Cat-Boost Classifier,
    Random Forest Classifier, it performs better because due to the presence of the
    LSTM the tracking of the time dependent samples becomes superior. Even compared
    to CNN, the Adam Optimizer''s support to CNN provides excellent accuracy and is
    supported by memory-efficient processing. Systems with low memory requirements
    are more useful when running cloud-based apps. However, they are not appropriate
    for use in transfer learning. The hybrid CNN + LSTM + MHSA combination provides
    better accuracy, is light weight (as optimization is achieved), takes lesser training
    and testing times. Hence, it is found to be more suitable for a cloud resident
    combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer. Exactly identical works
    have not been reported but a work of similar nature is32 where the authors have
    used ML and DL methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset
    of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables reporting an efficiency of around
    90%. The key aspect of the present work is its better precision (97%) while it
    combines fruit health monitoring and rainfall prediction using certain sensor
    inputs and samples images. Table 8 Summary of certain statistical metrics of rainfall
    prediction and fruit health recognition and comparison with previous results.
    Full size table Its better performance in certain situations is due, in part,
    to the unique capabilities brought to the design by combining CNN with LSTM, MHSA,
    and softmax layers. The LSTM layers capture dependencies and patterns in sequential
    data, but CNN excels in capturing spatial hierarchies of features in pictures
    or sequences and recognizing patterns independent of their location in the input
    space. Capturing input sequences'' global dependencies is an area where the MHSA
    performs well. Down this way, the model might have focused on pertinent data and
    create long-range relationships by giving varying weights to various portions
    of the input sequence. Rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring have both
    benefited from these improvements while adopting sensor data and picture processing.
    Here, we''ve described how to create a NodeMCU-based network, which offers benefits
    like easy database linkage, built-in WiFi connectivity, and good communication
    range. This technology supports a range of a few hundreds of meters and may be
    utilized both indoors and outdoors. The platform delivers a fusion of the sensors
    when every sensor is linked to NodeMCU. It is feasible to locate and identify
    sensor connection issues. A motor controller and real-time data monitoring for
    data analysis are included with the mobile app. The motor controller controls
    the condition of the water pump. The website is enhanced with all of the tools
    used for fruit health assessment and rainfall forecasting. The fruit health recognition
    webpage offers a good analysis of the input photographs to identify whether the
    fruit is rotting or ripe, and the rainfall prediction forecasts the weather for
    the following day. Data on soil moisture and temperature are collected with accuracy
    and precision by the modern agriculture management system developed utilizing
    IoT and ML techniques. Additionally, it helps farmers increase agricultural productivity
    and provide an atmosphere that is effective for growing food. It contributes to
    a decrease in over- and under-irrigation, soil erosion, and water waste by providing
    data from the used sensors. So, an automated system for monitoring fruit health
    and providing farming help with relation to water resources is a crucial tool
    for the cultivator and entrepreneurs. The cost-effectiveness of the whole effort
    can be improved with an automated method. In addition to the foregoing, the offered
    methodologies have quick execution times and dependable decision-making, which
    cannot always be matched by employees hired for the job. The sensor pack offers
    exact cutoff points at which water sprinklers could start. Additionally, it aids
    in reducing water waste. With human intervention, it would not always be possible
    to maintain the precise timing and volume of watering. With regard to fruit health
    monitoring, the same is true. The laborious and thorough nature of the work done
    by human workers may be inaccurate. A scalable, profitable, and effective production
    system can be developed using an IoT and machine learning (ML)-based agriculture
    management system. The statistical metrics for predicting rainfall, identifying
    fruit health, and comparing current results are shown in Table 8. The benefits
    of the suggested approach are obvious. However, the performance of the system
    is dependent on the latency of response which is a factor determined by wireless
    network coverage and certain hardware dependence. Conclusions Here, we reported
    the design of a precision agriculture setup with stress on adoption of sensors,
    IoT and ML to regulate water flow and process management so as to maximize crop
    yield. The work deals with the workings of various sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and air quality sensors, in an IoT
    package to collect and monitor the real-time status of an agriculture management
    system associated with rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring. The key
    aspect of the work is the design and configuration of a few ML algorithms namely
    CatBoost, Gaussian NB, Random Forest and CNN + LSTM classifiers trained to provide
    accurate rainfall prediction, fruit health monitoring and recognition (carried
    out using CNN + Softmax, Adam optimizer, GoogLeNet and ResNet50) and provide area
    under curve (AUC) scores as well as accuracy value under on field conditions.
    Further, we have designed a combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer
    using a CNN + LSTM and a multi-head self-attention mechanism. This approach requires
    lesser memory, is more reliable and requires low computation time. These provide
    sufficient ground for formulation of an integrated agriculture assistant for cultivation
    of certain types of fruits. Experimental results show that the approach is precise
    and robust and the services are hosted using a web portal with a user-friendly
    interface. Data availability When requested, the authors will make available all

  description: Droughts pose a severe environmental risk in countries that rely heavily
    on agriculture, resulting in heightened levels of concern regarding food security
    and livelihood enhancement. Bangladesh is highly susceptible to environmental
    hazards, with droughts further exacerbating the precarious situation for its 170
    million inhabitants. Therefore, we are endeavouring to highlight the identification
    of the relative importance of climatic attributes and the estimation of the seasonal
    intensity and frequency of droughts in Bangladesh. With a period of forty years
    (1981–2020) of weather data, sophisticated machine learning (ML) methods were
    employed to classify 35 agroclimatic regions into dry or wet conditions using
    nine weather parameters, as determined by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI). Out of 24 ML algorithms, the four best ML methods, ranger, bagEarth,
    support vector machine, and random forest (RF) have been identified for the prediction
    of multi-scale drought indices. The RF classifier and the Boruta algorithms shows
    that water balance, precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature have a higher
    influence on drought intensity and occurrence across Bangladesh. The trend of
    spatio-temporal analysis indicates, drought intensity has decreased over time,
    but return time has increased. There was significant variation in changing the
    spatial nature of drought intensity. Spatially, the drought intensity shifted
    from the northern to central and southern zones of Bangladesh, which had an adverse
    impact on crop production and the livelihood of rural and urban households. So,
    this precise study has important implications for the understanding of drought
    prediction and how to best mitigate its impacts. Additionally, the study emphasizes
    the need for better collaboration between relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers,
    researchers, communities, and local actors, to develop effective adaptation strategies
    and increase monitoring of weather conditions for the meticulous management of
    droughts in Bangladesh.

    access 23 September 2021 Introduction Climate change has had and continues to
    have catastrophic effects on humanity. Severe weather occurrences, particularly
    heat waves, droughts, cyclones, and heavy rain, are becoming more frequent and
    intense, leading to displacement, famine, and poverty1. Drought, the most frequent
    climate occurrence worldwide, is characterized by a shortage of precipitation
    which causes long-term water scarcities2,3,4,5. Droughts are one of the most expensive
    calamities, affecting millions of people annually and costing an estimated $6
    to $8 billion annually6. However, the slow-onset nature of drought makes it challenging
    to analyze and model its spatio-temporal consequences. Bangladesh is one of the
    utmost prone to natural catastrophes nations in the biosphere because of its geographical
    location7. Drought is a frequent natural disaster in the country. Bangladesh experienced
    extreme droughts in 1973, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2006,
    and 20098. Scholars recognized that drought poses a significant risk to food security6,9,10.
    Climate change and scarcity of groundwater, combined with unpredictable rainfall
    and high temperatures, negatively impact the yields of various crops, particularly
    in the northwest region of Bangladesh11. Pre-kharif (mid-March to mid-May) and
    Rabi (mid-November to mid-March) crops are highly susceptible to drought12. Every
    year, droughts of varying intensities have caused damage to around 2.32 million
    hectares of land9. In addition to agricultural loss, drought has social and environmental
    consequences such as loss of livelihoods, migration, food price hikes, loss of
    biodiversity, disease, land degradation, and so many others1,13. Hence, drought
    prediction studies are necessary to reduce the adverse impacts of drought events
    on water resources, agriculture, energy production, ecosystems, public safety,
    and the economy. They are critical for sustainable resource management and preparedness
    in the face of a changing climate14. Climate change adaptation and coping strategies
    have remained a global concern for decades. One of the key reasons for the failure
    of disaster risk management in climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh is
    that the government always emphasizes response and recovery over monitoring, preparedness,
    and mitigation. In light of this, accurate drought projections are crucial for
    the sustainable management of agricultural resources. The erratic and spatial
    nature of drought, with varying intensity and frequency10, necessitates identifying
    rapid, consistent, and precise prediction models to quantify drought-related risks.
    Several drought indices have been established in recent decades to monitor drought
    on regional and global scales15,16,17,18,19,20,21. Among them, the standardized
    precipitation index (SPI)20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29, standardized precipitation
    evapotranspiration index (SPEI)15,18,19,20,21,27,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,
    and Palmer drought severity index (PDSI)39,40 were widely used. Recently developed
    SPEI15 has the advantage of determining many types of drought41. The SPEI takes
    into account both the multi-scalar properties and straightforward computation
    of the SPI and the PDSI''s sensitivity to shifts in evaporation demand; hence,
    broadly acceptable for monitoring and analyzing drought characteristics42. Sustainable
    water management requires a reliable data-driven drought prediction model43,44.
    Traditional stochastic techniques, such as the autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) models, were
    the most widely used for predicting droughts45,46. Recent applications of machine
    learning (ML) models offer the advantage of being more adaptable and robust for
    drought prediction44,47,48,49,50,51,52. ML models better capture complicated relationships
    between variables, handling nonlinearity and temporal dependencies. Additionally,
    ML models can be easily updated with new data, making them suitable for dynamically
    changing environments53,54. Several ML models, such as artificial neural networks
    (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), support vector regression (SVR), random forests (RF),
    relevance vector machine (RVM), genetic programming (GP), and extreme learning
    machine (ELM) have been used in complex modeling interactions46,55,56,57. However,
    because of regional variability, no generalized or ideal model is acceptable for
    all climates situations13; rather, there is a risk of misleading model development10,58.
    In Bangladesh, very little research has been done using ML methods13,59,60. All
    research was one or two region-specific61, and the development of ML models for
    drought forecasting on a more disaggregate regional scale has yet to unfold. Besides,
    researchers did not identify the relative importance of climatic attributes for
    drought assessment. The novelty of this study is that it fills these gaps by developing
    the best ML models for SPEI forecasting at multiple time scales and drought intensity
    mapping for Bangladesh. Specifically, the current study predicts SPEIs for 35
    meteorological stations using 24 ML models. Then the deployed models'' performance
    was evaluated to select the best drought forecasting features, and finally the
    spatio-temporal pattern of seasonal drought intensity and frequency was estimated
    for meteorological research stations across Bangladesh. The weather patterns in
    Bangladesh are undergoing significant transformations due to its proximity to
    the equator and the rising global temperatures62,63. As a consequence of these
    changes, the country has been confronted with severe weather fluctuations, including
    frequent flooding and other calamities. In regions of Bangladesh where drought
    is a persistent concern, experts have observed an increase in the occurrence of
    droughts, attributable to alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns64.
    The impact of climate change is anticipated to result in more substantial economic
    losses from droughts65, affecting water resources and contributing to water scarcity66.
    These adverse consequences underscore the need for the development of robust forecasting
    and monitoring models for drought, enabling the timely formulation of strategies
    to manage drought-related risks67. Effective drought forecasting is an indispensable
    component of drought management. Inadequate forecasting can lead to suboptimal
    management practices and potential harm to the environment. Consequently, there
    is a pressing demand for rapid, reliable, and accurate models for drought prediction
    that can furnish quantitative insights into impending drought-related threats.
    These models leverage the appropriate combination of input variables or drought
    indices to deliver precise drought forecasts68. By exploring the interplay between
    climatic variables and machine learning models69, we aim to uncover the optimal
    combination that can provide actionable insights and early warning systems for
    mitigating the far-reaching impacts of droughts in the region. This research represents
    a vital step towards harnessing technology and data-driven approaches to address
    the pressing challenges posed by seasonal droughts, offering the potential to
    safeguard agricultural practices in Bangladesh. Our research holds significant
    implications for science, policy, and practice. Scientifically, it showcases the
    efficacy of machine learning methods in drought prediction and underscores the
    significance of integrating weather parameters in drought analysis. From a policy
    perspective, the study underscores the need for enhanced collaboration among stakeholders,
    including policymakers, researchers, communities, and local actors, to formulate
    effective adaptation strategies. In practical terms, the findings highlight the
    crucial importance of heightened weather condition monitoring in Bangladesh to
    mitigate the adverse effects of droughts on crop production and livelihoods. The

    in South Asia, stands out for its distinctive geographical and environmental features.
    Situated between latitudes 20°34'' and 26°38'' N and longitudes 88°01'' and 92°41''
    E (Fig. 1), it shares borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar
    (Burma) to the southeast70. To the south, the Bay of Bengal forms a natural boundary.
    This densely populated nation boasts a complex landscape with expansive riverine
    systems, fertile alluvial plains, and the renowned Sundarbans, the world''s largest
    river delta. Its predominantly low-lying terrain renders it susceptible to flooding,
    storm surges, and monsoon rains, with intermittent droughts affecting certain
    regions. Featuring a tropical climate, the country experiences average temperatures
    ranging from 12.8 to 31.1 °C. The annual rainfall varies from 1700 mm in the northwest
    to over 5000 mm in the southeastern region13, establishing Bangladesh as one of
    the world''s wettest countries. The climate features distinct wet and dry seasons,
    profoundly impacting agriculture, the economy, and the predominantly agrarian
    livelihoods of its people. Bangladesh''s unique geographical and climatic conditions
    have made it a focal point for research in areas such as climate change, agriculture,
    water resource management, and disaster preparedness, underlining its critical
    importance due to its vulnerability to environmental challenges and the potential
    for innovative solutions to enhance the well-being of its population. Figure 1

    use Climate records at the daily timescale from 35 meteorological stations were
    collected by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) over the past 40 years,
    from 1981 to 2020 (Fig. 1). The climate variables were daily rainfall amount (mm),
    maximum temperature (°C), minimum temperature (°C), mean temperature (°C), sunshine
    hours (h), wind speed (ms−1), and relative humidity (%). In addition, potential
    evapotranspiration (PET) at the monthly timescale was calculated from the aforementioned
    climate variables. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recommends the
    Penman–Monteith (PM) equation71 as the single standard technique for calculating
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and it has been effectively utilized in Bangladesh.
    It integrates physiological and meteorological attributes and has been widely
    used around the world because of its intrinsic rationality and reliability72.
    Hence, the PM equation based on the weather parameters was utilized to compute
    the monthly ET0 over the research locations. Model selection process for data
    analysis In this research, twenty-four (24) machine learning models were constructed
    to predict the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in various
    timescales, including 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month periods. The methodology, as illustrated
    in Fig. 2, encompassed the subsequent procedural phases: (a) Data collection and
    preprocessing: The SPEI database was generated by utilizing meteorological variables
    from the SPEI computation model. (b) Feature selection: The optimal features for
    classifying drought conditions were identified through the application of correlation
    and random forest classifier methods. (c) Model selection and cross-validation:
    To implement machine learning algorithms, the dataset was randomly divided into
    training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and all data points from each research
    station were imported into the R programming environment. Machine learning algorithms
    were employed on the training datasets, the models were validated using the testing
    datasets, and SPEI predictions were generated for various time scales. Each meteorological
    station''s resulting output values were ranked to determine the most suitable
    machine learning models. (d) Model evaluation: Models were evaluated using appropriate
    performance metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and R2. (e) Model comparison: We compare
    the performance of different models and select the one that best aligns with our
    research objectives and provides the most accurate results. (f) Validation and
    robustness testing: The selected model was further validated using different subsets
    of the data to assess its robustness. (g) Model output and visualization: We focus
    on the presentation and interpretation of the model output through a robust visualization
    process. Figure 2 Conceptual framework of prediction of SPEI by ML algorithms
    for the study. Full size image Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index
    (SPEI) SPEI is a widely used technique for measuring drought dynamics over multiple
    time frames15. The SPEI is derived from precipitation and temperature data using
    a simple water balance to measure the effects of surface evaporation caused by
    increasing global temperatures73. It has an advantage over the SPI, because it
    combines rainfall and temperature into its computations, whereas SPI only uses
    rainfall22. The calculation of SPEI is based on the original SPI calculation procedure
    and hence uses the same index categorization criteria15. The initial step in computing
    the SPEI is to determine the monthly water balance (Di), which is the difference
    between the precipitation (Pi) and potential evapotranspiration (PETi). Afterwards,
    these values are combined at the desired timescales74 as: $${D}_{i}={P}_{i}-{PET}_{i}$$
    (1) $${D}_{n}^{k}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\left({P}_{n-i}-{PET}_{n-i}\\right), n\\ge
    k$$ (2) where, k = 1, 3, 6, and 12 for SPEI = 1, 3, 6, and 12 is the aggregation
    timescale, and n is the nth month. Using the log-logistic probability distribution,
    the D-series was fitted. The cumulative distribution function F(x)75 can be expressed
    as follows: $$F \\left(x\\right)={\\left[1+{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha }{x-\\gamma
    }\\right)}^{\\beta }\\right]}^{-1} k$$ (3) where, the parameters of scale, shape,
    and location are written as α, β, and γ, respectively. The SPEI value is derived
    from the standard value provided: $$SPEI=W-\\frac{{c}_{0}+{c}_{1}W+{c}_{2}{W}^{2}}{1+{d}_{1}W+{d}_{2}{W}^{2}+{d}_{3}{W}^{3}}$$
    (4) $$W=\\sqrt{-2{\\text{ln}}(P)} for P\\le 0.5$$ (5) where P indicates the likelihood
    of exceeding a certain D value, and F(D) represents the cumulative distribution
    of D. When P is greater than 0.5, it is replaced with the non-exceed likelihood
    (F(D) = 1 − P) and the direction of the derived SPEI is inverted. The constants
    are c0 = 2.5155, c1 = 0.8028, c2 = 0.0103, d1 = 1.4328, d2 = 0.1892 and d3 = 0.001343.
    In this study, we estimated SPEI at time scales of one month (SPEI1), three months
    (SPEI3), six months (SPEI6), and a year (SPEI12). These estimates were used to
    measure the impact of precipitation deficits in the short term on agricultural
    drought. According to the SPEI classification criteria, the value of SPEI ≥ 0
    indicates no drought, − 1.0 < SPEI < 0 indicates mild drought, − 1.5 < SPEI ≤  − 1.0
    indicates moderate drought, − 2.0 < SPEI ≤  − 1.5 indicates severe drought and
    SPEI ≤  − 2.0 indicates extreme drought76. The greater the value of the SPEI in
    the negative, the more severe the drought. We also estimated the severity of drought.
    A drought event''s duration (m) equals the number of months between its start
    (included) and end month (not included). The absolute value of the total of all
    SPEI values during a drought event is known as severity (Se). A drought event''s
    intensity (DIe) is defined as severity divided by duration77. The greater the
    DIe number, the more severe the drought. The formulae are as follows: $${S}_{e}={\\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{Index}_{j}\\right|}_{e}$$
    (6) $${DI}_{e}=\\frac{{S}_{e}}{m}$$ (7) where, e, j, Indexj, m, Se, and DIe are
    the drought event, month, SPEI value in month j, duration, severity, and intensity
    of a drought event e, respectively. Best feature selection criteria Feature selection
    is a widely used process of selecting the best features that can significantly
    influence the predicted outcomes, increasing model performance and accuracy, and
    reducing running time78,79. We considered two different feature selection approaches,
    random forest (RF), and the Boruta algorithm, to identify the most significant
    weather variables that affect SPEIs. The Boruta and Caret packages were used for
    feature selection in RStudio software. A brief overview of these two techniques
    is provided here: Random forest RF employed Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean
    Decrease Gini (MDG) to select variables80. When a variable is left out of the
    model, the MDA value represents how much precision is compromised. The more accuracy
    lost the more importance of the variable for successful classification. The MDG
    measures the contribution of each variable to the homogeneity of the random forest''s
    nodes and leaves. The greater the MDG score, the greater the significance of the
    variable in the model81. Additionally, we used dichotomy method as a rapid variable
    screening technique. Time series of SPEI and other related weather variables were
    used to find a proficient and robust estimation of the best classifier. As a rule,
    the majority of scholars employed permuting out-of-bag (OOB henceforth) error
    or impurity to evaluate the significance of a single variable82,83,84, whereas
    we employed both. The OOB error is a bootstrap aggregation-based approach for
    assessing the prediction error of random forests, boosted decision trees, and
    other machine learning models85. Boruta algorithm The Boruta algorithm was introduced
    by Kursa and Rudnicki86. This technique attempts to reduce misleading outcomes
    due to correlations and random fluctuations by introducing more randomization
    and collecting results from the entire set of randomized samples. The relative
    importance of the climatic variables was identified for the estimate approach
    by following the steps outlined in Ebrahimi-Khusfi87, and Kursa and Rudnicki86.
    Machine learning algorithms We considered analyzing 24 distinct machine learning
    algorithms from various ML fields to determine the correlation between drought
    prediction and the weather attributes. The prediction of multiscale SPEI1, SPEI3,
    SPEI6, and SPEI12 considered tree-based algorithms, regression, and classification
    models. We used multiple predictive modeling techniques employing a variable selection
    algorithm. These methods included linear least squares models and penalized linear,
    additive, and recursive partitioning models, all implemented with R programming
    code for variable selection and prediction (Table 1). Table 1 List of 24 machine
    learning methods and their characterizations. Full size table The study measured
    the performance of each ML algorithm independently. ML algorithms employ various
    statistical, probabilistic, and optimization methods to extract useful patterns
    from large and complex datasets that are unstructured and derived from past experiences61.
    Time series data is characterized by a sequential order, where each observation
    is influenced by the preceding observations. Applying traditional cross-validation
    techniques to time series data can introduce a significant source of bias since
    it violates the temporal structure of the data. To obtain robust and reliable
    estimates of a model''s performance, assess its generalization capabilities, and
    make informed decisions in model selection, using tenfold cross-validation with
    five repetitions, the algorithms were trained and compared. It helps reduce the
    impact of random variations, provides more stable performance metrics, and aligns
    with established practices in the field of machine learning and data analysis.
    All predictive models were trained utilizing the Caret package''s interface for
    the train function88. The train function generates the parameter tuning by determining
    the values that maximize root-mean-square error (RMSE) accuracy. The data were
    divided into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. The ML function determines the
    optimal subset of predictors for the best accurate model. Finally, the study rated
    lists of predictors from each training approach for the final models. Model evaluation
    metrics Model validation is a necessary step of ML modeling for evaluating the
    accuracy and reliability of models. Scholars employed various statistical metrics
    for this purpose89,90,91. We used RMSE, MAE, and R2 to evaluate the performance
    of the constructed models. The statistical evaluation metrics are the following
    for all parameters: $$RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\left({Y}_{obs}-{Y}_{pred}\\right)}^{2}}{N}}$$
    (8) $$MAE=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|{Y}_{obs}-{Y}_{pred}\\right|}{N}$$ (9)
    $${R}^{2}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({Y}_{obs}-{\\overline{Y} }_{obs}\\right)\\left({Y}_{pred}-{\\overline{Y}
    }_{pred}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\left({Y}_{obs}-{\\overline{Y} }_{obs}\\right)}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\left({Y}_{pred}-{\\overline{Y}
    }_{pred}\\right)}^{2}}}$$ (10) where, Yobs and Ypred indicates the actual and
    predicted dependent variable, respectively, with N denoting the number of observations.
    As a general rule, models with a lower RMSE, MAE, and a larger R2 during testing
    were deemed more accurate for accuracy of good prediction model. Partial dependence
    plots (PDPs) method The model-independent method is based on determining the \"flatness\"
    of the PDPs of each feature. PDPs assist in visualizing the influence of low cardinality
    feature space subsets on the estimated prediction surface, such as main effects
    and two/three-ways interaction effects. The PDPs provides model-independent interpretations
    and can be developed via a supervised machine learning approach. We train a projection
    pursuit regression (PPR) model and use the pdp package to generate PDPs for each
    feature92. The PDPs can be misled in the presence of substantial interactions93.
    To solve this issue, Goldstein et al.93 developed individual conditional expectation
    (ICE) charts, which are available in the R programming package ‘ICEbox’. The ICE
    plots display the estimated association between the response and a predictor of
    relevance for each observation. Consequently, the PDP for an activity predictor
    may be computed by averaging the proper ICE curves'' overall data. Results Correlation
    analysis In this study, the meteorological indices, standardized precipitation
    evapotranspiration index at multiple time scales (SPEI1, SPEI3, SPEI6, and SPEI12),
    were chosen to assess the drought conditions of Bangladesh. The study aimed to
    explore their associations with nine distinct weather parameters: precipitation
    (PRCP), minimum temperature (TMIN), maximum temperature (TMAX), average temperature
    (TMEAN), total sunshine (TSUN), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), evapotranspiration
    (ET), and water balance (WB) (Fig. 3). Regarding SPEI1, the correlation coefficients
    revealed statistically significant (p < 0.05) and positive associations with rainfall
    (0.390), relative humidity (0.215), and water balance (0.422). Conversely, there
    were statistically significant negative correlations with maximum temperature
    (−0.168), mean temperature (−0.070), total sunshine hour (−0.265), wind speed
    (−0.129), and evapotranspiration (−0.258). The correlation results revealed that
    meteorological indices at the 3-month time scale (SPEI3) exhibited a nearly identical
    relationship like SPEI1 with meteorological variables. Specifically, rainfall,
    minimum temperature, relative humidity, and water balance displayed significant
    positive associations with SPEI3, with correlation coefficients of 0.316, 0.058,
    0.233, and 0.338, respectively. On the other hand, there were statistically significant
    negative correlations with maximum temperature (−0.090), total sunshine hour (−0.189),
    wind speed (−0.105), and evapotranspiration (−0.185). Figure 3 Correlation coefficients
    among the weather parameters and SPEI’s values. Full size image Also, for both
    SPEI6 and SPEI12, the correlation analysis reveals significant (p < 0.05) positive
    associations with rainfall (0.238 and 0.153), relative humidity (0.178 and 0.095),
    and water balance (0.261 and 0.163) (Fig. 3). In the case of SPEI6 and SPEI12,
    it''s noteworthy that a negative and statistically significant relationship was
    observed with certain meteorological parameters. Specifically, maximum temperature
    exhibited negative correlations of −0.113 for SPEI6 and −0.034 for SPEI12. Likewise,
    total sunshine hour displayed negative correlations of −0.130 for SPEI6 and −0.045
    for SPEI12. Additionally, wind speed showed negative correlations of −0.111 for
    SPEI6 and −0.067 for SPEI12. Furthermore, evapotranspiration had particularly
    significant negative correlations, with values of −0.195 for SPEI6 and −0.081
    for SPEI12. These results indicate that as SPEI6 and SPEI12 values decreased,
    these meteorological parameters tended to increase, and the relationships were
    statistically significant. Identification of best climatic attributes for different
    SPEIs Based on the results depicted in Fig. 4, the critical variables for the
    SPEI1 time scale were identified as WB, PRCP, TMIN, and ET. For the SPEI3, SPEI6,
    and SPEI12 time scales, the most significant variables were WB, PRCP, TMAX, and
    TMIN. Consequently, WB, PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN emerged as the predominant factors
    influencing the construction of drought prediction models using machine learning.
    Figure 4 Best feature combination of predictor variables based on the Boruta algorithm.
    Full size image The random forest classifier algorithms tuned using cross-validation
    ten folds and five repeats were summarized, and the performance of the RF classifier
    was presented in Table 2. The best three contributors for the SPEI1 model were
    WB, PRCP, and TMIN with the highest percentage values, and the overall OOB error
    rate for SPEI1 model was 17.77%. However, the worse contributor was identified
    as WS, RH, and TSUN, getting the lowest percentage among the variable for SPEI1.
    We found that the SPEI3 model had the same contributors as the SPEI1 model. The
    best predictor for SPEI6 was WB, followed by TMIN, PRCP, and TMAX. The worse contributor
    was WS, which had the lowest percentage value of MDA and MDG, but the OOB error
    rate was 23.05%. The annual time scale (SPEI12) also has a vital role in identifying
    and predicting drought. The best and most significant contributors for SPEI12
    were WB, TMIN, and TMAX, and the OOB error rate was low at 6.59%. Thus, the findings
    indicated that WB, PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN were the most significant contributors
    to drought model prediction across different time scales of Bangladesh. Table
    2 Performance of RF classifier model with different SPEI time scales derived from
    different feature combinations. Full size table Performance evaluation of ML models
    for different SPEIs during the training phase To assess the precision and performance
    of the model, we utilized metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
    square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). In our interpretation,
    a well-performing model is characterized by lower MAE and RMSE values and a higher
    R2 value. For predicting SPEI1 (Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration
    index at a 1-month time scale), the ranger model stood out as the most accurate,
    boasting an impressive R2 value of 0.689, indicating its substantial explanatory
    power (Fig. A1a). Additionally, it displayed relatively lower RMSE (0.547) and
    MAE (0.417) values, reflecting close alignment with actual data. The rf, svm,
    and cforest models also performed well, securing the second, third, and fourth
    positions, respectively, in SPEI1 prediction accuracy. Conversely, the CART and
    lars2 models exhibited lower accuracy in predicting SPEI1. According to Fig. A1b,
    evaluating the performance of machine learning models for predicting the 3-month
    time scale drought (SPEI3), the ranger model emerged as the top performer with
    an R2 of 0.602, RSME = 0.600, and MAE = 0.454, indicating robust predictive capabilities.
    The rf model closely followed, achieving an R2 of 0.602, RSME = 0.601, and MAE = 0.456.
    The qrf and cforest models secured the third and fourth positions with R2 values
    of 0.598 and 0.593, respectively. In contrast, the lars2 and rqlasso models exhibited
    lower accuracy in predicting SPEI3. The analysis was extended to predict SPEI6,
    which represents a 6-month drought index. In this case, the ranger model continued
    to exhibit strong performance, with the highest R2 value of 0.512, and the lowest
    RSME (0.661) and MAE (0.522). The rf, svm, and cforest models closely followed.
    Once again, the CART and lars2 models were less accurate in predicting SPEI6 (Fig.
    A1c). For the 12-month time scale drought (SPEI12), the qrf model emerged as the
    top performer with the highest R2 value of 0.871, signifying its exceptional predictive
    accuracy of drought condition. The ranger, rf, and cforest models also demonstrated
    robust performance, while the CART and lars2 models exhibited comparatively lower
    accuracy in forecasting SPEI12 (Fig. A1d). The Taylor diagram, a widely used pictorial
    tool, serves to evaluate the performance of ML models13,83. This diagram visualized
    the spatial pattern of calculated (reference field) against predicted (test field)
    multi-time scale SPEI values94. Fig. A2 depicts the Taylor''s diagram, incorporating
    metrices such as RMSE, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation for SPEI1,
    SPEI3, SPEI6, and SPEI12. It was observed from the figure that all ML models exhibited
    a standard deviation of less than one across each SPEI time scale. Similarly,
    the correlation results varied from 0.40 to 0.80 for SPEI1, SPEI3, and SPEI6,
    while ranging from 0.40 to 0.95 for SPEI12. Additionally, centered RMSE was more
    scattered in SPEI12 compared to other time scales. Notably, the ranger model consistently
    outperformed than other models across all time scales. Observed and predicted
    performance of ML models for countrywide datasets The scatter plot illustrating
    the performance of observed and predicted SPEIs is presented in Fig. A3a–d. For
    SPEI1 (Fig. A3a), actual vs predicted R2 values ranged from 0.26 to 0.69, with
    46% (11 models) displaying R2 values equal to or exceeding 60%. Notably, models
    such as ranger, rf, qrf, and cforest demonstrated high accuracy during validation.
    In the case of SPEI3, 21% (5 models) exhibited an R2 value surpassing 0.60, with
    ranger, rf, qrf, cforest, and svm models showcasing exemplary prediction performance
    (Fig. A3b). Approximately 17% of SPEI6 models achieved an R2 value greater than
    0.49, with ranger, svm, rf, and qrf models standing out (Fig. A3c). The R2 square
    values for SPEI12 ranged from 0.29 to 0.87, and during validation, qrf, ranger,
    and rf models exhibited R2 values exceeding 80%, indicating highly accurate prediction
    performance (Fig. A3d). In conclusion, the drought prediction performance of ML
    models varied across different time scales, with ranger, rf, and qrf models demonstrating
    consistency. Another approach to identify the best model with fewer outlier issues
    is presented in Fig. A4a–d, providing an overview of the actual and predicted
    scenario of ML models, including outlier considerations. All models, across various
    time scales, showcased optimal performance when addressing the outlier problem.
    Empirical data supported the superiority of ranger, rf, and qrf models for precise
    drought prediction in Bangladesh. In contrast, CART, lars2, pcaNNet, ImStepAIC,
    and some other models struggled to overcome outlier values, negatively impacting
    their performance compared to the actual values of SPEI1, SPEI3, SPEI6, and SPEI12.
    Ranking the best predictive model for different regions at multiple timescales
    of SPEIs Given the geographical positioning and climatic unpredictable changes
    across the country, a one-size-fits-all model would not be suitable for predicting
    drought in all locations. Here, we demonstrated a regional drought forecast for
    35 meteorological stations using 24 ML models at various SPEI periods (Fig. 5a–d).
    The performance of each model was graded using higher R2 and lower MAE and RMSE
    values, illustrated through a heatmap. The results revealed that the best model
    differed across geographical locations and timespan. In the northern region of
    Bangladesh, for instance, at Rajshahi station in SPEI1 and SPEI12, the ranger
    model performed the best (ranked first). Similarly, the bagEarth and svm models
    had the highest performance in SPEI3 and SPEI6, respectively. In the southern
    region of Khulna, the ranger, bagEarth, earth, and ppr models performed most well
    at SPEI1, SPEI3, SPEI6, and SPEI12, respectively. Regarding regional representation,
    the ranger model demonstrated superior performance in 79% and 63% of regions (out
    of 35 stations) for SPEI1 and SPEI3, respectively. Conversely, for SPEI6 and SPEI12,
    the bagEarth and ppr models excelled, leading in 63% and 58% of regions, respectively
    (Fig. 6). However, the heatmaps of SPEI1 and SPEI3 were identical, and the usual
    R2 values for SPEI12 were fairly high. Refer to Figs. 5a–d and 6 for detailed
    information on the best model for each region. Figure 5 Heatmap illustrates the
    region-specific ML model selection for drought assessment based on R2, MAE, and
    RMSE values. Various colors indicate the strength of the R2 values. The region-specific
    ranking of ML models for predicting (a) SPEI1, (b) SPEI3, (c) SPEI6, and (d) SPEI12
    was displayed by the added value label in the middle of the box. Greater R2 and
    lower MAE and RMSE values defined the performance ranking scale of the model.

    prediction models in Bangladesh across different timescales and regions. Full
    size image Evaluation of best predictive models for the specific region We used
    scatter plots of fitted vs. observed values and R2 values to evaluate the best
    model for use across all regions and different time periods of SPEIs (Fig. 7).
    For SPEI1, the R2 values ranged from 0.57 to 0.93, indicating a positive correlation
    between the ML model and the observed data, with the model explaining 57–93 percent
    of the variance in the fitted data. Similarly, for SPEI3 and SPEI6, the R2 values
    ranged from 0.52 to 0.92 and 0.57 to 0.95 respectively, signifying a positive
    correlation between the ML models and the observed data, with the model’s explaining
    52–92 percent and 57–95 percent of the variance in the fitted data, respectively.
    Lastly, the high R2 value for SPEI12 suggested a better fit for the model. Thus,
    confirming the validity of the models selected for drought prediction in Bangladesh
    across different time scales and regions. Figure 7 Region-specific best predictive
    ML models'' performance. Full size image To examine the accuracy in SPEI prediction,
    boxplots of 25%, 50%, and 75% quantile values for both observed and projected
    SPEI are shown in Fig. 8. The figure illustrates that the identified best models
    adequately simulated the variability in SPEI1, SPEI3, SPEI6, and SPEI12 values
    across different regions. While many predicted SPEI values exhibited minimum fluctuation,
    except the observed values displayed a wide range when SPEI fell below -2 or exceeded
    2 in a few cases. However, the identified best model showed better accuracy in
    simulating the variability and quantile of SPEIs compared to others. All prediction
    models exhibited enhanced performance in modeling SPEI quantiles across various
    SPEI scales, particularly at higher orders. Figure 8 Box plot presentation of
    the best ML model performance of SPEI prediction for multiple time scales at the
    35 investigated meteorological stations of Bangladesh. Full size image Partial
    dependence plot for fitted projection We employed a multivariate regression model
    to assess the significance of weather variables, and their relative effect on
    predicting SPEIs. In our analysis, ICE curves (depicted in black) and their mean
    (illustrated as the red line) were employed to visualize the relationships between
    individual weather attributes and the predicted SPEIs. This approach allowed us
    to identify critical climatic threshold values (Fig. 9). The findings revealed
    that Bangladesh experienced a range of drought moderate to severity levels, with
    a deficit of 92, 95, 115, and 143 mm of average rainfall over one, three, six,
    and twelve months, respectively. Temperature played a crucial role, with minimum,
    maximum, and mean temperatures exceeding 20.7 ± 1.1, 30.9 ± 0.7, and 25.9 ± 0.8
    ℃, respectively, resulting in severe drought conditions across these time scales.
    Similarly, we observed that extended periods of sunshine hours and relative humidity
    surpassing 6.3 ± 0.6 h and 77.3 ± 1.3%, respectively, contributed to drought conditions.
    Low wind speeds below 1.9 ± 0.2 m/s and high evapotranspiration exceeding 123 ± 10
    mm at all four-time scales also played a significant role in inducing drought
    in the country. Furthermore, the water balance was identified as a substantial
    factor affecting SPEI prediction. Below-average water balance levels, specifically
    116, 143, 148, and 190 mm for one, three, six, and twelve months, respectively,
    were associated with drought occurrences in Bangladesh. These findings provide
    critical insights into the complex interplay of weather variables and their impact
    on drought patterns in the study region. Figure 9 Fitted a partial dependence

    pattern of seasonal drought intensity and frequency Using the region-specific
    best selected model based on SPEI influential meteorological parameters, we predicted
    the seasonal intensity and frequency of drought over time in Bangladesh (Fig.
    10). We divided the forty years into four periods, i.e., Period I: 1981–1990,
    Period II: 1991–2000, Period III: 2001–2010, and Period IV: 2011–2020. Results
    showed that while drought intensity has decreased over time, but the return period
    has become more frequent. Spatially, the drought intensity shifted from the northern
    to central and southern zones of the country. In periodic assessment, the period
    with the most severe drought intensity was Period II. Notably, the frequency of
    drought has increased in Periods III and IV, indicating an increase in the number
    of droughts that occurred twice a decade in the past. Figure 10 Spatio-temporal
    pattern of drought intensity and frequency based on the best predicted model for
    Pre-kharif, Kharif, and Rabi seasons over four decades (1981–1990, 1991–2000,
    2001–2010, and 2011–2020) of Bangladesh. The authors used ArcGIS 10.8 (https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)
    to generate the map, employing the administrative shapefile of Bangladesh in the
    process. Shapefile republished from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council

    size image Season-wise, Pre-kharif was the most common season for drought compared
    to other seasons. During the Period I of the Pre-kharif season, the northern,
    eastern, and a few southern regions of the country were primarily affected by
    severe drought. During Period II, the northern and the majority of the central
    regions were most affected by drought, while the severity of drought in the north
    and center regions gradually relieved in Period III. In Period IV, the drought
    severity has been more prevalent in the Rangpur, Bogura, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Cumilla,
    Jashore, Sitakundu, Kutubdia and parts of southern regions in Bangladesh. Except
    for Rajshahi, the drought intensity of the Barind tract (located mainly in the
    northwestern part) was so unpredictable and has decreased significantly in recent
    decades. Noticeably, we found that the intensity of drought (> 1.0) in Chattogram
    division has been affected continuously over the last forty years. The highest
    frequency of drought was observed during Period III (2001–2010). Among all periods,
    the spatial patterns of drought frequency had changed, and high crop-intensive
    areas had become more vulnerable in the Pre-kharif season. During the Kharif season
    (June-October), the incidence of drought was lower than in the Pre-Kharif season,
    but the pattern was comparable. In Period I of the Kharif season, the northern
    region of the country was hit by a severe drought, and the central half of the
    region was affected by a moderate drought. The intensity of the drought shifted
    from the north to the central region during the succeeding decade. During Period
    III, the majority of the northwest region again witnessed a severe drought, while
    the rest of the county was affected by a mild drought. In Period IV, the frequency
    of drought increased relative to previous periods, and its intensity rose in the
    north-eastern, central, and southern regions of Bangladesh. During the Rabi season
    in Period I, the southwest and a portion of the northern region experienced drought
    intensity larger than one, and drought frequency greater than three times the
    average. However, nearly the entire country faced drought conditions in the succeeding
    decade. Throughout the country, the drought intensity has reduced, but frequency
    increased in Period III. Again, during Period IV, the divisions of Barishal, Chattogram,
    and Sylhet, as well as parts of the central regions, had droughts with intensities
    more than one. This suggests that drought conditions were similarly erratic throughout
    the Rabi season. Overall, the intensity and frequency of drought in Bangladesh
    have exhibited erratic patterns over the past forty years, with certain periods
    witnessing more severe droughts than others. Factors such as average rainfall,
    temperature, sunshine hours, relative humidity, wind speed, and evapotranspiration
    have collectively influenced drought intensity, along with water balance deficits.
    These factors have significantly influenced SPEI predictions, rendering regions
    with high crop intensity more susceptible. This underscores the crucial importance
    of comprehending the impacts of drought on food production and livelihoods in
    the region. Discussion Bangladesh experiences a predominantly tropical climate
    characterized by high temperatures and humidity, with droughts being more prevalent
    than other climate stressors in the country13. The occurrence, severity, and duration
    of droughts vary based on meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural factors95.
    In an effort to develop best ML-based models for predicting seasonal droughts
    in Bangladesh, this study utilized data from 35 meteorological stations at four
    distinct time scales. Applying 24 ML models based on the SPEI, we compared them
    with individual station predictions at different time intervals, contributing
    to the formulation of a spatio-temporal drought management program. In alignment
    with previous studies by Alamgir et al.96 and Yaseen et al.13, our SPEI1 results
    indicated a short-term rainfall deficit, SPEI3 and SPEI6 suggested agricultural
    drought, and SPEI12 reflected reductions in river flow and groundwater levels,
    signifying hydrological droughts in Bangladesh. The use of ML models guaranteed
    the robustness of the drought prediction. We observed precipitation, maximum and
    minimum temperature, and water balance was the essential elements for predicting
    droughts in Bangladesh. Similar findings has been found by Rahman and Lateh8.
    In Pakistan, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed were the most significant
    meteorological characteristics for accurately predicting drought97. Using ML models,
    Zhang et al.46 determined that temperature and precipitation, air pressure, wind
    speed, relative humidity, and duration of sunshine have a substantial effect on
    drought in China. So, it is evident that the relative importance of meteorological
    parameters on drought prediction varies among geo-climatic and geographical segments.
    Zhang et al.46 also stated that rf, ranger, qrf, bagEarth, and svm were the best
    methods for annual drought prediction. In the context of model stability assessment,
    the ranger model has the highest chance for 1–5 rating 90% of the time in SPEI1,
    SPEI3, and SPEI12 time scales. On another side, svm and bagEarth have 91% and
    86% probability on the SPEI6 time scale, respectively. The svm-based models exhibited
    great temporal and geographical drought characterization in Pakistan97. Similarly,
    we observed that the performance and efficacy of the model varied based on the
    time frame and location of its application. Our exemplary findings urged for the
    adoption of regional models instead of a single unified model, considering regional
    spatio-temporal heterogeneity. This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of influential
    meteorological variables on the SPEI depicted in Fig. 4, and the identification
    of region-specific best models shown in Fig. 6. These models indicate a spatio-temporal
    shift in both the intensity and frequency of seasonal drought patterns in Bangladesh,
    as illustrated in Fig. 10. Notably, the intensity of drought in climate hotspot
    regions, such as northwest and northern Bangladesh, has diminished and gradually
    shifted towards the center and south. Similar findings were reported by Mohsenipour
    et al.12. Projections until the end of the century (the 2070s) anticipate a decrease
    in maximum drought intensity98. Among the three seasons in Bangladesh, the Pre-kharif
    season witnessed the most significant decline in drought severity over the years.
    Comparable changes in drought patterns have been reported periodically in several
    Asian countries, including Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, India, China, and
    Pakistan1,46,97,99,100,101. Considering land use changes in drought prediction
    models is essential for a comprehensive understanding of drought dynamics. It
    enables improved assessments of water availability, vegetation responses, human-induced
    vulnerabilities, feedback mechanisms, and the design of effective adaptation and
    mitigation strategies102,103. By accounting for land use changes, enhance the
    accuracy and relevance of drought predictions, ultimately supporting sustainable
    water resource management and resilience to drought events. Changes in drought
    duration and recurrent nature justified the trends in crop damage and lower cropping
    intensity in Bangladesh8. The Climate Change Cell of Bangladesh104 reported that
    droughts reduced T. Aman rice yields by 45–60% and Rabi crop yields by 50–70%.
    Boro (grown in the Rabi season), the major rice, is entirely dependent on irrigation.
    Prolonged water scarcity encourages excessive groundwater extraction for irrigation,
    which further depletes groundwater levels in drought-prone regions9. To cope with
    drought, many farmers have chosen drought-resistant rice varieties cultivation105,106,
    but adoption rates remain low107. Other adaptation strategies included switching
    farming practices or changing the crop-sowing windows. Depending on the severity
    of the drought, some rural households may choose to migrate or change their livelihoods108.
    Overall, this could severely impact food supplies and endanger food security.
    The economic losses associated with severe drought in specific countries can vary
    widely depending on factors such as the severity of the drought, the country''s
    economic resilience, and its dependence on agriculture and water resources109.
    The United States experienced substantial economic losses from drought, particularly
    in agricultural states such as California and Texas. Prolonged droughts can lead
    to reduced crop yields, increased irrigation costs, and even water shortages for
    urban areas. The economic impact can run into billions of dollars110. Australia
    has a history of severe droughts, which can devastate the agriculture sector.
    The \"Millennium Drought\" in the early 2000s, for example, resulted in significant
    economic losses, affecting everything from livestock farming to wine production111.
    Severe droughts in South Africa have led to water scarcity and reduced agricultural
    productivity. In recent years, the country has experienced drought-related losses
    in key sectors like maize production and livestock farming112. India, with its
    large agricultural sector, is highly vulnerable to drought. Severe droughts can
    lead to crop failures, food shortages, and economic hardships for farmers. The
    economic losses can be substantial113. Droughts in Brazil impacted its important
    agricultural and livestock sectors. The country''s economy is closely tied to
    these industries, making drought-related losses a significant concern114. In countries
    with fragile economies like Somalia, severe drought had devastating effects, leading
    to food shortages, loss of livestock, and economic distress115. Ethiopia experienced
    recurring droughts, leading to food insecurity and economic challenges. Efforts
    to mitigate the impact of drought and build resilience are ongoing in the country116.
    In sum, the imperative to prioritize drought mitigation cannot be overstated for
    nations grappling with the profound impacts of water scarcity. Making drought
    a top policy concern is paramount to developing comprehensive strategies encompassing
    preparedness, response, and recovery. As evident in the experiences of these countries,
    a forward-looking policy framework is crucial to building resilience, ensuring
    effective response mechanisms, and facilitating a swift recovery from the complexities
    posed by drought. By placing drought mitigation at the forefront of policy agendas,
    nations can proactively address the multifaceted challenges posed by water scarcity,
    safeguarding their economies, food security, and overall well-being for a more
    sustainable and resilient future. The potential for future research on long-term
    drought prediction is vast and holds great significance in understanding and mitigating
    the impacts of drought events. In this regards, deep learning models, specifically
    transformers, could be used on drought prediction. Developing and refining climate
    models to better capture long-term climate variability and teleconnections can
    enhance our ability to predict droughts beyond seasonal time scales117. Incorporating
    more accurate representations of physical processes, feedback mechanisms, and
    regional climate dynamics can improve model performance for longer-term predictions118.
    Incorporating data from remote sensing, ground-based observations, and hydrological
    models can enhance our understanding of the complex feedbacks between the land
    surface and the atmosphere, enabling better predictions of long-term drought conditions119.
    Ensemble methods, data assimilation techniques, and hybrid models that combine
    the strengths of physical models and data-driven approaches may improve the skill
    and reliability of long-term drought predictions120,121. So, the understanding
    of long-term drought prediction and contribute to more effective planning, preparedness,
    and management of drought events at longer time scales is required. Conclusions
    and policy recommendations The objective of this research is to determine the
    most effective machine learning methods and categorize the key factors influencing
    drought prediction. Utilizing a dataset spanning four decades of different weather
    variables, we conducted extensive statistical analysis and employed data visualization
    techniques to gain insights from the data. We explored a total of twenty-four
    machine learning models, encompassing both regression and classification approaches,
    which included linear, non-linear, and ensemble learning techniques. An inclusive
    assessment of the twenty-four models’ performance, by applying statistical metrics
    such as the R2, RMSE, and MAE method during the model validation phase. Results
    shows, four best ML methods, ranger, bagEarth, support vector machine, and random
    forest have been identified for the prediction of multi-scale drought indices.
    Our findings revealed that Bangladesh experienced varying levels of drought, ranging
    from moderate to severe and existing the shifting tendency by regions with specific
    deficits in average rainfall over different time periods. For instance, the deficit
    was 92, 95, 115, and 143 mm over 1, 3, 6, and 12-months’ time span, respectively.
    Temperature was identified as a crucial factor influencing drought conditions,
    with minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures exceeding certain thresholds resulting
    in severe drought conditions across different time spans. This information is
    valuable for understanding how temperature variations can impact drought severity.
    Additionally, we observed that extended periods of sunshine hours and high relative
    humidity levels also contributed to drought conditions in the region. Low wind
    speeds and high evapotranspiration further exacerbated drought conditions. Ranking
    of multi-model machine learning algorithms indicate the appropriate selective
    options for different stations getting best prediction accuracy during drought
    forecasting. Reliable and effective strategies for choosing the right weather
    variables and constructing accurate predictive models can help to reduce the destructive
    impacts of drought. In this study, the application of ML models confirmed the
    efficacy and reliability of the research. Moreover, model selection for each region
    improves the study performance, and the output can be used to assess drought risk
    in Bangladesh. Our research proposes specific recommendations to address various
    aspects of drought mitigation in Bangladesh. To enhance water resource management,
    we advocate for strategies that improve water storage, allocation, and distribution
    systems, including the construction of reservoirs, promotion of water recycling
    and rainwater harvesting, and implementation of water conservation practices.
    In terms of promoting agricultural resilience, we highlight the importance of
    adopting climate-smart agricultural practices such as cultivating drought-tolerant
    crop varieties, implementing efficient irrigation techniques, practicing crop
    rotation, promoting agroforestry, and adopting sustainable land management practices.
    Additionally, we emphasize the significance of strengthening early warning systems
    by integrating climate data, remote sensing technologies, and advanced modeling
    techniques to improve the accuracy and lead time of drought predictions. Furthermore,
    our recommendations aim to enhance drought preparedness and response through the
    development of drought contingency plans, establishment of drought monitoring
    and assessment frameworks, and provision of financial and technical support to
    vulnerable communities. Lastly, we advocate for the formulation and implementation
    of policies that prioritize drought risk reduction and sustainable water resource
    management, including the integration of drought mitigation strategies into national
    and regional development plans, establishment of regulatory frameworks, and allocation
    of financial resources for drought resilience projects. By including these specific
    recommendations, our study aims to bridge the gap between research findings and
    practical applications, providing policymakers and stakeholders with tangible
    guidance to effectively mitigate the impacts of droughts in Bangladesh. Future
    research should seek to better understand the effects of climate change on drought
    intensity, impact mechanism on crop, and explore strategies for adapting to longer-term
    drought. Collaboration between researchers, local authorities, and community organizations
    can help to identify effective solutions that take into account local socio-economic
    contexts and water management strategies that are amenable to research. Additionally,
    more research is needed to assess mitigation strategies, such as better water
    infrastructure and conservation efforts, to lessen the impacts of droughts. Data

    It helps the economy in addition to supplying food. Plant leaves or crops are
    vulnerable to different diseases during agricultural cultivation. The diseases
    halt the growth of their respective species. Early and precise detection and classification
    of the diseases may reduce the chance of additional damage to the plants. The

    in the detection and classification of plant diseases based on images of infected

    Agricultural biodiversity is essential for providing humans with food and raw
    materials and is an essential component of human civilization [1, 2]. The disease
    can occur when pathogenic organisms such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes; soil
    PH; temperature extremes; changes in the quantity of moisture and humidity in
    the air; and other elements continuously harm a plant. Plant diseases can have
    an impact on the growth, function, and structure of plants and crops, affecting
    the people that rely on them. The majority of farmers still use manual methods
    to detect and classify plant ailments because it is difficult to do so early on,
    and this reduces productivity. Agriculture’s productivity is a significant economic
    factor. As a result, disease identification and classification in plants are critical
    in agricultural industries [3]. If proper precautions are not taken, it can have
    serious consequences for plants by reducing the quality, quantity, or productivity
    of the corresponding products or services. Automatic disease detection and classification
    recognize symptoms at an early stage, i.e., when they first appear on plant leaves,
    lowering the amount of labor necessary to monitor large farms of crops. According
    to [4] Plant leaf disease is a major issue in rice production, and the disease
    has the potential to harm the crop, resulting in a drop in products. Farmers have
    a difficult time detecting and classifying plant leaf diseases. The traditional
    method of detecting and classifying diseases by physical observation is not always
    reliable and may result in a significant decrease in agricultural production [5].
    Plant diseases attack the leaf initially before infecting the entire plant, reducing
    production quality and quantity [6]. Recent advances in DL have resulted in numerous
    approaches for detecting and classifying plant disease using images of infected
    plants [7]. Early detection and classification of plant diseases is critical for
    increasing agricultural productivity [8, 9]. Plant diseases reduce crop results
    by having a negative impact on the crop [10]. Plant disease identification is
    a major challenge in agriculture for both farmers and experts [11]. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) increases crop productivity by detecting and classifying plant
    leaf diseases early on before they spread to other plants on the farm [12]. Accurate
    plant disease classification would not only increase crop results but will also
    provide support for various cultivation methods [13]. Every country needs farming
    to meet its requirements as well as to strengthen its economy. When crop plants
    are damaged by diseases, the country’s production and its economy are also affected
    [14, 15]. Because of data disparities, selecting an appropriate approach for image
    processing is always a difficult task. To produce good results, huge datasets
    necessitate advanced approaches such as CNN and large image datasets result in
    increased accuracy rates [16]. Image processing is used to improve the quality
    of images to extract valuable information from them; as a result of this feature,
    image processing techniques are used in many areas of the medical and agricultural
    fields, such as color processing, remote sensing, and pattern recognition. Image
    processing techniques that are acceptable, effective, and dependable can be used
    to discover disease in plant leaves. Image processing can be used in a variety
    of fields, including biology, agriculture, medicine, engineering, computing, etc.
    Computerized image processing techniques are critical for detecting and classifying
    plant diseases early before they cause widespread damage to entire crops [17,
    18]. To address this, several DL, image processing, and ML techniques were being
    developed to detect and classify disease in plants using images of plant leaves.
    DL technologies can help agricultural firms succeed. This research focuses on
    the comparative study of the performances, evaluation metrics, and results of
    numerous methodologies and methods previously used to detect and classify different
    forms of plant leaf diseases using image processing approaches. Accordingly, finding
    a reliable technique to apply is critical to increasing the yields of agricultural
    products. The paper will have the following contributions to the scientific community.
    This paper presents an overview of recent advances in plant disease detection
    and classification using ML and DL approaches. Accordingly, it provides an in-depth
    review of the state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies used in the area by
    covering research published in the field. The paper shows how using ML and DL
    approaches improves the performance and speed of plant disease detection and classification.
    Identifying the best DL technique for multi-class plant disease detection and
    classification and optimal identification accuracy. The development of DL techniques
    for detecting and classifying numerous plant diseases; Addressing the different
    labeling and class challenges in recognizing plant diseases by recommending multi-class,
    multi-label DL techniques. The use of a new technique with different steps designed
    to improve plant disease detection and classification in real-world images yields
    quick results and is suited for real-time applications. The rest of the paper
    is organized into different but interrelated subsections. The paper begins by
    discussing plant disease identification and classification in Sect. \"Plant disease
    identification and classification\", factors responsible for plant diseases in
    Sect. \"Factors responsible for plant diseases\", detection and classification
    of plant diseases in Sect. \"Detection and classification of plant diseases\",

    Computer vision is a subdomain of AI that allows machines to counterfeit the human
    visual system and precisely draw out, inspect, and recognize real-world images
    in the same way that humans do [19]. ML techniques have been used to detect and
    classify plant diseases, but with advancements in a subset of ML, DL, this area
    of research appears to have considerable potential in terms of increasing accuracy.
    Many developed DL architectures were used, along with various visualization techniques,
    to detect and classify plant disease symptoms accordingly [20]. Medical diagnosis,
    espionage, satellite images, and agribusiness are just a few of the rapidly increasing
    industries that have already shown the benefits of computer vision-based technologies.
    Computer vision-enabled systems can be used in agriculture to detect and classify
    plant diseases based on different features or symptoms that have been extracted.
    It uses a well-defined series of steps beginning with image acquisition and continuing
    with various image-processing tasks such as scaling, filtering, segmentation,
    feature extraction, and selection, and finally, detection and classification are
    performed using ML or DL techniques [21]. Factors responsible for plant diseases
    A wide range of agricultural diseases can arise at various stages of plant development
    and harm the plant’s growth, which can have a negative impact on overall crop
    production [19, 22, 23]. Plant diseases are caused by a variety of conditions
    at various phases of plant development [24]. As summarized in [22], crop disease-causing
    variables are categorized into two: biotic factors and abiotic factors. Biotic
    factors such as viruses, fungi, bacteria, mites, and slugs emerge as a result
    of microbial infection in plants, whereas abiotic variables such as water, temperature,
    irradiation, and nutritional deprivation damage plant growth [9, 25,26,27,28].
    Accordingly, some sample plant leaf images with different diseases from the PlantVillage
    dataset and different images from other datasets showing healthy and diseased
    plant leaves have been included in the study [21] and different images from other
    datasets showing healthy and diseased plant leaves have been summarized in the
    works of [29] and [30] accordingly. Additionally, the detail computer vision-based
    techniques and proccsses including field crops, image acquisition, leaf image
    datasets, image preprocessing (test set, training set, and validation sets), data
    splitting, and performance assessment methods) for plant disease detection and
    classification have been clearly indicated in the work of [21]. The details of
    the factors responsible for plant diseases has been depicted in Fig. 1. Additionally,
    some sample plant leaf images with different diseases from the PlantVillage dataset
    and different images from other datasets showing healthy and diseased plant leaves
    have been depicted in Figs. 2. 3 respectively. Fig. 1 Factors responsible for

    have been depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Computer vision-based techniques for plant
    disease detection and classification[21] Full size image Detection and classification
    of plant diseases The detection and classification of crop diseases is an essential
    use of DL, ML, and computer vision techniques in agriculture industries [1]. The
    aim is to develop algorithms and techniques based on images of leaves or other
    plant features that can automatically detect and classify agricultural plant diseases.
    This can help farmers assist and manage the disease. Following a detailed and
    critical study of numerous recent ML and DL-based approaches developed for plant
    disease detection and classification in the literature, the author has summarised
    a few key challenges in crop disease detection and classification, allowing the
    research community to investigate the causes that may have a significant impact
    on real-time-based systems for plant identification and diagnosis. Some factors
    and issues may have an impact on disease identification and classification; the
    majority of them have been summarised in the studies of [19, 27, 28, 31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].
    Plant disease detection and classification techniques Machine learning (ML) techniques
    or algorithms A. The NB Technique It is a probabilistic classifier variation built
    on the NB classifier idea [19, 21]. It is assumed that the patterns’ prior probabilities
    are known to exist and that the class labels are assigned their posterior probabilities.
    In light of this premise, the maximum likelihood values of the data that belong
    to a specific class label are computed using the posterior probability. It is
    calculated by applying Baye’s theorem to the product of each feature’s conditional
    probability. This theory works fairly well in many classification problems, even
    though it usually does not hold in a real-life setting. B. The KNN Technique It
    is a nonparametric, supervised ML technique commonly applied to pattern recognition
    [19, 21]. It is predicated on the nearest neighbor rule, which is applied in ML
    applications to classify data. This method involves training the test pattern
    using the classifier, and then classifying the test pattern according to how similar
    it is to each training pattern. The KNN classifier produces a class membership
    value that it is a member of. The object is allocated to the most widely used
    class labels among its k-nearest neighbors based on the plurality vote of its
    neighbors. It functions similarly to an instance-based learning model, with locally
    approximated operations and distinct computations throughout the classification
    process. C. The DT Technique In supervised learning, it is a supervised classification
    and regression algorithm that creates classifiers by splitting the data into multiple
    smaller groups (tree structure) according to which division creates the greater
    disproportion [19, 21]. One of the often utilized attribute selection metrics
    that are frequently employed as disparity measurements is the Gini index, also
    known as entropy. One benefit of this method is that it may make it simple for
    humans to interpret the results. If the tree could have trained without being
    limited by its depth, a DT may generate very little training error. Several DT
    variations, including ID3, C4.5, and CART, are widely employed in various data
    mining and ML applications. D. The SVM Technique The separating hyperplane defines
    this supervised ML classifier. In high-dimensional space, this technique determines
    the ideal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the data points of the
    two classes [19, 21, 29]. The kernel tricks that are helpful for nonlinear classification
    are an attribute of SVM. Obtaining more distinct features in the high-dimensional
    feature space is highly anticipated. Several general functions, including the
    linear, polynomial, and radial basis functions, can be used to transform the features
    to finish it. The feature space’s dimensions could grow significantly as a result
    of feature transformation. As such, it lengthens the classification process’s
    training period. By calculating the dot products, it might change the features
    into higher proportions without changing the feature set. E. The RF Technique
    It is a collection of learning techniques for randomized DT classifiers [19, 21].
    During training, it is run by building several DTs. Based on each classification
    tree’s vote, the class labels of the testing dataset are calculated. The class
    labels with the highest votes by the classification trees determine the classifier’s
    final result. This approach attempts to produce an uncorrelated forest of trees
    that will predict performance more accurately than that of the individual tree
    by using bagging and randomness of features during the building of each tree.
    Deep learning (DL) techniques or algorithms A. The CNN Technique Deep feed-forward
    neural networks are used by the CNN to analyze multidimensional data. The CNN
    learns channels that are activated after it classifies a particular highlight
    at some spatial positioning information [19, 21, 24, 29]. The number of epochs
    utilized in the implementation of various convolution filters with dimensions
    of 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 determines their accuracy. This is contingent upon the filter’s
    dimensions. Several pre-trained architectures, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50,
    ResNet152, InceptionV3, InceptionNet, and DenseNet121, are available for use with
    the CNN approach. B. The ANN Technique A neural network is a model that mimics
    the information processing capabilities of a biological system, such as the brain
    [19, 21, 29]. Coefficients link artificial neurons, also known as processing elements
    (PEs), to create a network structure. Experience leads to the discovery of data
    patterns and linkages rather than their programming. Because ANNs can comprehend
    complex data, they can be utilized to extract patterns from it. Related works
    In this study, the author has analyzed the literature on various plant leaf disease
    detections and classifications, as well as the models/techniques that have been
    used. According to [1], DL-based solutions for real-time insect detection and
    identification in the soybean crop have been proposed. The performances of various
    transfer learning (TL) models were investigated to determine the feasibility and
    reliability of the proposed approach for determining the insect’s identification
    and detection accuracy. The proposed approach achieved 98.75%, 97%, and 97% accuracy
    using YoloV5, InceptionV3, and CNN, respectively. Among these, the YoloV5 algorithm
    performs quite well in the solution and can run at 53 fps, making it suitable
    for real-time detection. Furthermore, a dataset of crop insects was collected
    and labeled by mixing images taken with various devices. The proposed study reduced
    the workload of the producer, was considerably simpler, and produced better results.
    The authors of [14] have proposed a system that uses DL approaches to classify
    and detect plant leaf diseases. They collected the images from the PlantVillage
    dataset website. They used the CNN to classify plant leaf diseases in the suggested
    method. There were 15 classes, including 12 classes for diseases of various plants
    that were found, such as bacteria, fungi, and so on, and three classes for healthy
    leaves. As a result, they achieved high accuracy in both training and testing,
    with an accuracy of 98.29% in training and 98.029% in testing for all data sets
    used. In the study of [25], an effective method for recognizing and identifying
    rice plant disease based on the size, shape, and color of lesions in a leaf image
    has been presented. The suggested model uses Otsu’s global threshold technique
    to perform image binarization to remove image background noise. To detect the
    three rice diseases, the proposed technique based on a fully connected CNN was
    trained using 4000 image samples of each diseased leaf and 4000 image samples
    of healthy rice leaves. The results revealed that the proposed fully connected
    CNN approach was fast and effective, with an accuracy of 99.7% on the dataset.
    This accuracy far exceeded that of the existing plant disease detection and classification
    methods. The authors of [26] have presented a model based on CNN to identify and
    classify tomato leaf disease using a public dataset and complement it with images
    taken on the country’s farms. To avoid overfitting, generative adversarial networks
    were used to generate samples that were similar to the training data. The results
    reveal that the proposed model performed well in the detection and classification
    of diseases in tomato leaves, with an accuracy greater than 99% in both the training
    and test datasets. The authors of [29] have used the dataset “PlantVillage” to
    depict four bacterial infections, two viral diseases, two mold diseases, and one
    mite-related ailment. Images of unaffected leaves were also shown for a total
    of 12 crop species. For the development of prediction models, ML approaches such
    as SVMs, grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), and CNNs were used. AI for
    classification has evolved alongside the development of the backpropagation of
    ANNs. Based on the real-time leaf images gathered, a KMC operation was also performed
    to detect diseases. Finally, the proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy
    of 99% and 98% for rice trees and apples, respectively, and 96%, 94%, 95%, and
    97% for tomato trees. Multi-class classification problems, such as the one in
    this study, were evaluated using precision, recall, and f-measure metrics for
    a set containing only one symptom pool for each class. The authors of [39] have
    proposed the use of an enhanced CNN technique to detect rice disease. DNNs have
    had a lot of success with image classification tasks. In this study, they have
    demonstrated how DNNs can be used for plant disease detection in the context of
    image classification. Finally, this research compares existing techniques in terms
    of accuracy of 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% for TL, CNN + TL, ANN, and ECNN + GA techniques,
    respectively. The work in [40] has addressed numerous ML and DL techniques. SVM,
    KNN, RF, LR, and CNN were the ML approaches used in the study effort for disease
    prediction in plants. Then, a comparison of ML and DL approaches was carried out.
    Among the ML techniques, the RF has the best accuracy of 97.12%; however, when
    compared to the DL model presented in the study, the CNN technique has the highest
    accuracy of 98.43%. The capacity to identify rice leaf disease was limited by
    the image backgrounds and the conditions under which the images were acquired
    [41]. DL models for automated identification of rice leaf diseases suffer significantly
    when evaluated on independent rice leaf disease data. The results of well-known
    and frequently used TL models for detecting rice leaf disease were examined in
    this study. There were two methods for accomplishing this: frozen layers and fine-tuning.
    The DenseNet169 findings produced an excellent testing accuracy of 99.66%, and
    when the results of the fine-tuned TL models were analyzed, Xception performed
    well and achieved 99.99% testing accuracy. The authors of [42] have presented
    Ant Colony Optimisation with Convolution Neural Network (ACO-CNN), a novel DL
    technique for disease detection and classification. ACO was used to assess the
    effectiveness of disease diagnostics in plant leaves. The CNN classifier was used
    to subtract color, texture, and plant leaf arrangement geometries from the given
    images. Some of the effectiveness metrics used for analysis and providing a proposed
    method demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous techniques
    with an accuracy rate. Aoncert measurements were utilized for the execution of
    these approaches. Finally, the ACO-CNN model outperformed the C-GAN, CNN, and
    SGD models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The accuracy
    rates of C-GAN, CNN, and SGD were 99.6%, 99.97%, and 85%, respectively. The accuracy
    rate in the ACO-CNN model was 99.98%; therefore, precision, recall, and F1-score
    have higher rates in the ACO-CNN technique compared to other models, and the F1-score
    has the highest rate compared to other models. The authors of [43] have presented
    a DL model (PPLCNet) that includes dilated convolution, a multi-level attention
    mechanism, and GAP layers. The model used novel weather data augmentation to expand
    the sample size to enhance the generalization and robustness of feature extraction.
    The feature extraction network uses saw-tooth dilated convolution with a configurable
    expansion rate to extend the perceptual field of the convolutional domain, effectively
    addressing the problems of insufficient data information extraction. The lightweight
    CBAM attention mechanism was located in the feature extraction network’s middle
    layer. It was used to improve the model’s information representation. By reducing
    the number and complexity of parameters computed by the network, the GAP layer
    prevents overfitting of the model. The validation of the retained test dataset
    reveals that the PPLC-Net model’s recognition accuracy and F1-score were 99.702%
    and 98.442%, respectively, and that the number of parameters and FLOPs were 15.486
    M and 5.338G, respectively, which can meet the requirements of accurate and fast
    recognition. Furthermore, the proposed integrated CAM visualization approach fully
    validates the efficiency of the proposed model. According to the study [44], an
    effective CNN model was proposed to categorize tomato leaf diseases and detect
    the name of the disease affecting tomato leaves. An approach to a 2-dimensional
    Convolutional Neural Network (2DCNN) model with 2-Max Assembling covers and completely
    related layers has been proposed. The experimental results show that the model
    was successful enough to detect the disease with an accuracy of 96% when compared
    to other classification models such as SVM, VGG16, Inception V3, and Mobile Net
    CNN model. To extract different features [45] have used model engineering (ME).
    To improve feature discrimination and processing speed, several SVM models were
    used. In the training process, the kernel parameters of the radial basis function
    (RBF) were computed depending on the selected model. Six leaf image sets encompassing
    healthy and sick leaves of apple, corn, cotton, grape, pepper, and rice were analyzed
    using PlantVillage and UCI databases. Accordingly, the categorization procedure
    yielded almost 90,000 images. The findings of the experimental implementation
    phase reveal the potential of a powerful model in classification activities, which
    would be useful for a variety of future leaf disease diagnostic applications in
    the agricultural business. In terms of stability, the dilated learning model outperforms
    the typical ResNet-18 design. On the test set, the model had an average accuracy
    of 98.5% for leaf disease recognition models. In recognizing grape or cotton leaf
    diseases, a test set accuracy of 97.93% is less than the proposed structure’s
    accuracy of 97.93%. The authors of [46] have presented an image segmentation algorithm
    for the automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. It also
    includes an overview of various disease classification techniques that can be
    used to detect plant leaf disease. The genetic algorithm was used for image segmentation,
    which was vital for disease detection in plant leaf disease. The ensemble classifiers
    (EC) in [47] were developed by using various approaches to preparation, feature
    extraction, and classification. The performance of these multiple ensemble techniques
    was then compared to select the best ensemble classifiers. The suggested technique’s
    precision and reliability were tested in both controlled laboratory settings and
    real-world conditions using two databases, namely PlantVillage and Taiwan tomato
    leaves. The top EC, which achieved 96% accuracy, was determined by the consideration
    of shadow, brightness fluctuations, disease similarities, background clutter,
    multiple leaves, and diverse textures. Here, the proposed ensemble models were
    presented and linked to several DL techniques. Furthermore, the proposed solution
    outperformed the most recent state-of-the-art DL technique. The authors of [48]
    have proposed a hybrid DL approach for the early detection and classification
    of tomato plant leaf diseases. A CNN, a convolutional attention module (CBAM),
    and SVM were combined in the hybrid system. The proposed approach was evaluated
    using a database of tomato leaf images. The suggested model can initially detect
    nine distinct tomato diseases; however, it is not limited to this. The obtained
    findings were highly encouraging, with an accuracy of up to 97.2%, which can be
    improved by improving learning processes. Here, the proposed approach outperformed
    better than the state-of-the-art DL approaches. The proposed system was lightweight
    and efficient, so the farmer may install it on any smart device with a digital
    camera and processing capabilities. A farmer can detect any disease immediately
    with a little training, allowing them to take timely preventive measures. The
    authors of [49] have tested and presented their work on a publicly available standard
    database, the PlantVillage Kaggle dataset. More specifically, they obtained mAP
    and accuracy values of 98.10% and 99.97%, respectively, as well as a test time
    of 0.23 s. Both qualitative and quantitative results confirmed that the presented
    solution was robust for plant leaf disease detection and could replace manual
    systems. Moreover, the suggested method showed a low-cost solution to tomato leaf
    disease classification that was robust to several image transformations, such
    as variations in the size, color, and orientation of the diseased portion of the
    leaf. Furthermore, the framework can locate the affected plant leaves when there
    are variations in blurring, noise, chrominance, and brightness. The authors have
    confirmed that, based on the reported data, their technique was robust to several
    tomato leaf disease classifications under varying image-capturing conditions.
    The proposed work in [50] has employed an aggregated loss function by combining
    triplet and cross-entropy loss with MobileNetV2 as a basis model for the effective
    classification of plant disease using small samples. For the evaluation of the
    proposed study, two publicly available datasets (PlantVillage with 54,303 leaf
    samples and Plantdoc with 2598 leaf samples) were used. To partition the dataset
    into the source and target domains, different domain splits were examined, and
    a large quantity of testing was conducted on the target dataset using various
    sample sizes. For the analysis of the PlantVillage dataset, four domain splits
    were considered, and it was found that using the proposed aggregated loss and
    the lightweight transfer learning (TL) model for the target domain data (K-ways,
    N-shot), an average improvement in accuracy was 1.49% for split-1, 16.25% for
    split-2, 2.9% for split-3, and 2.1% for split-4 when compared to previous work.
    For the plantdoc dataset, two domain splits were evaluated, yielding an accuracy
    of around 81% with 30 samples and more than 40% with only one sample. Using several
    evaluation measures such as loss functions, execution time, model size, and model
    parameters, the suggested work was compared to other state-of-the-art research
    works. According to [51], a DL approach for early ginger disease detection from
    the leaf was proposed through different phases. After collecting 7014 ginger images
    with the help of domain experts from different farms, a DL approach has been implemented.
    The acquired data was subjected to various image preprocessing to design and develop
    a DL model capable of detecting and classifying various scenarios. The experimental
    results showed that the proposed approach was useful for detecting ginger diseases,
    especially bacterial wilt. With a test accuracy of 95.2%, the proposed model can
    correctly detect the given image. The results showed that the DL approach provides
    a fast, affordable, and easily deployable strategy for ginger disease detection,
    making the model a useful early disease detection tool. This analysis was also
    extended to develop a mobile app to assist a large number of ginger farmers in
    developing countries. The work in [52] has examined an alternative approach for
    developing a disease detection model supported by leaf classification using deep
    convolutional networks (DCN). Growth in computer vision presents an opportunity
    to broaden and boost precision crop protection practice, as well as expand the
    market for computer vision applications in precision agriculture, a unique form
    of training, and thus the technique used allows for quick and direct implementation
    of the system in practice. The database used in this research work contains 77,000
    images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. They were able to train a CNN model
    for classifying plant diseases, determining whether they were present or not,
    and then another model was trained with YOLOv7 to detect the disease, with the
    trained classification model achieving an accuracy of 99.5% and the detection
    model achieving mAP, precision, and recall of 65%, 59%, and 65%, respectively.
    The authors of [53] have presented a DL-based CNN solution for automatically classifying
    and distinguishing cotton leaf diseases. There has been a lot of study done on
    leaf diseases that were common in many crops, but this work offered an effective
    and reliable method for identifying cotton leaf disease. The proposed method successfully
    classified and detected three significant cotton leaf diseases, which were difficult
    to control if not detected early. The proposed model for the identification and
    classification of cotton leaf diseases has used CNN, with training and testing
    accuracy of 100% and 90%, respectively. The research works of [54] have shown
    the detection of various diseases using hybrid image processing and decision tree
    (DT) techniques. The images were from Jimma and Zegie in Southern Ethiopia. Backpropagation
    artificial neural network (BPNN) and DT approaches were used. A total of 9100
    images were collected. 70% of them are used for training, while the remaining
    30% are used for testing. When a decision tree and a BPNN with a tanh activation
    function were coupled the overall accuracy was 94.5%. The authors used three different
    types of data sets [55] by including original images of RGB, blending images,
    and a mixture of RGB images and blending images. The classification results produced
    by a mixture of RGB images and blending images outperformed others, with a Genuine
    Acceptance Rate (GAR) of 96.7%, followed by a percentage of False Acceptance Rate
    (FAR) values of 3.3% and False Rejection Rate (FRR) values of 3.3%. The authors
    of [56] have proposed a technique in the literature that reports that have good
    detection accuracy but have a low reliability. This work has presented a DL-based
    method for detecting tomato disease using image segmentation. The authors create
    leaf masks with the VIA tool. The proposed method segments images using a customized
    U-Net model and then it classifies the segmented images into ten categories using
    a convolutional network. The accuracy of 98.12% proved that it was a promising
    technique for automated tomato disease detection, which can help to improve tomato
    production and reduce crop loss. According to [57] an autonomous method for detecting
    and classifying coffee plant disease becomes very crucial for better productivity.
    Here, the DL model was trained using 1120 images from the Wolaita Sodo agricultural
    research center, and an augmentation method was used to deal with data over-fitting.
    A total of 3360 images were used. They have compared training from scratch and
    TL strategies to get the best results during the classification of such diseases.
    As a result, training from scratch achieves an accuracy rate of 98.5%, whereas
    transfer-based learning achieved rates of 97.01% and 99.89% when using Mobilnet
    and Resnet50, respectively. The pre-trained Resnet50 model outperformed other
    approaches for the classification of images. The authors of [58] have proposed
    a method for detecting tomato plant disease using a DL-based system and image
    data from plant leaves. In this research, they have used the InceptionNet model
    and a DL architecture based on a recently developed CNN that was trained over
    18,161 segmented and non-segmented tomato leaf images using a supervised learning
    approach to detect and recognize various tomato diseases. In this work, two state-of-the-art
    semantic segmentation models, U-Net and Modified U-Net, were used to detect and
    segment disease-affected regions. By 98.66%, 98.5% IoU score, and 98.73% on the
    dice, the Modified U-net segmentation model exceeds the standard U-net segmentation
    model. Here, the InceptionNet1 achieved 99.95% accuracy for binary classification
    problems and 99.12% accuracy for classifying images with six segments; the InceptionNet
    technique outperformed the Modified U-Net model in terms of accuracy. The experimental
    findings of their proposed method for classifying plant diseases showed that it
    outperformed existing methods in the literature. The authors of [59] have proposed
    a pipeline for autonomous identification of tomato leaf diseases using three compact
    CNNs. The authors have used TL to extract deep features from the CNNs’ final fully
    connected layer for more condensed and high-level representation. Next, it merges
    elements from the three CNNs to take advantage of each CNN structure. Following
    that, a hybrid feature selection approach was used to select and build a comprehensive
    feature set of lower dimensions. The tomato leaf disease identification approach
    has been utilized for six classifiers. The results showed that the KNN and SVM
    techniques achieved the highest accuracy of 99.92% and 99.90% using only 22 and
    24 features, respectively. The proposed pipeline’s experimental findings were
    also compared with existing research studies for tomato leaf disease classification,
    confirming its competitive potential. The authors of [60] have combined features
    taken from input images using two recent pre-trained CNN models, ResNet50 and
    MobileNet, using a deep feature concatenation (DFC) technique. As a result, they
    have proposed MobiResNet: a neural network that was a concatenation of the ResNet50
    and MobileNet models for overall prediction capability improvement. 5400 olive
    leaf images were taken from an olive grove using a remote-controlled agricultural
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a camera to create the dataset used
    in the study. The overall performance of the MobiResNet model was 97.08%, demonstrating
    its superiority over ResNet50 and MobileNet, which attained classification accuracies
    of 94.86% and 95.63%, respectively. The PlantDet, a robust new deep ensemble model
    built on InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetV2L, and Xception, has been proposed in
    [61]. The PlantDet not only solves under-fitting problems, but it also nourishes
    performances for a scarce dataset with a sparse number of different background
    image datasets. PlantDet integrates efficient data augmentation, pre-processing,
    a Global Average Pooling layer, a Dropout mechanism, L2 regularizes, a PRelu activation
    function, Batch Normalization layers, and more Dense layers, which make the model
    more robust in comparison to all existing models and assist in dealing with under-fitting
    and overfitting problems while maintaining high performance. PlantDet outperformed
    the previous best model for the rice leaf dataset, with 98.53% accuracy, 98.50%
    precision, 98.35% recall, 98.42% F1-score, and 99.71% specificity. PlantDet also
    outperformed all available base models, including several robust ensemble models,
    on the Betel leaf dataset. Finally, Grad-CAM and Score-CAM were accomplished using
    the Xception approach to explain model performances, specifically how DL models
    function for this complicated dataset. In terms of localizing the predicted area,
    Score-CAM somewhat exceeded Grad-CAM +  + . The authors of [62] have introduced
    a strong plant disease classification system using a Custom CenterNet framework
    with DenseNet-77 as a base network. The presented method consists of three steps.
    Annotations were developed in the initial phase to determine the region of interest.
    Second, an enhanced CenterNet was presented, with DenseNet-77 recommended for
    deep key point extraction. Finally, several plant diseases were detected and classified
    using the one-stage detector CenterNet. They used the PlantVillage Kaggle database
    to do the performance analysis, which was the standard dataset for plant disease
    and challenges in terms of intensity variations, color changes, and differences
    in the shapes and sizes of leaves. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses
    confirmed that the presented method was more proficient and trustworthy than other
    latest approaches in identifying and classifying plant diseases. The goal of [63]
    was to assist farmers in correctly identifying early-stage diseases and informing
    them about these diseases. To properly describe and categorize tomato diseases,
    CNN was used. The entire experiment was carried out using Google Colab and a dataset
    including 3000 images of tomato leaves affected by nine different diseases as
    well as a healthy leaf. Firstly, the input images were first pre-processed, and
    the targeted area of images was split from the original images. Secondly, the
    images were further processed with different CNN model hyper-parameters. Finally,
    CNN extracts other features from images like as colors, texture, and edges, among
    others. The results showed that the proposed model predictions were 98.49% accurate.
    The authors of [64] have proposed a tomato leaf disease classification method
    using TL and feature concatenation. The authors extract features from MobileNetV2
    and NASNetMobile using pre-trained kernels (weights), then concatenate and reduce
    the dimensionality of these features using kernel principal component analysis.
    They then feed these features into a conventional learning algorithm. The experimental
    results confirmed the efficiency of concatenated features in improving classifier
    performance. The authors have tested the three most common traditional ML classifiers,
    RF, SVM, and multinomial LR, and found that multinomial LR performed the best,
    with an average accuracy of 97%. The authors of [65] have proposed a novel method
    for improving broadleaf plant categorization by combining filtered features collected
    by Local Binary Pattern operators and features retrieved by plant leaf contour
    masks. Noise in plant images was filtered using morphological operators of opening
    and closing. A testbed system was used to collect images at four stages of growth.
    Local binary pattern features based on masks were combined with filtered features
    and with a coefficient of k. SVM with radial basis function kernel was used to
    classify crops and weeds. By investigating optimal parameters, this method achieved
    a classification accuracy of 98.63% with 4 classes in the ‘‘bccr-segset’’ dataset
    published online, compared to a previously reported method’s accuracy of 91.85%.
    Directional Local Quinary Patterns (DLQP) as a feature descriptor for plant leaf
    disease detection and SVM as a classifier were investigated in [66]. The DLQP
    as a feature descriptor was being used for the first time in horticulture for
    disease detection. DLQP gives directional edge information by calculating the
    grey-level difference between the reference pixel and its neighboring pixel value
    by involving computation of their grey-level difference based on quinary value
    (− 2, − 1, 0, 1, 2) in the 0o, 45o, 90o, and 135o directions of a specified window
    of a plant leaf images. They have used a research-oriented PlantVillage dataset
    of tomato plant (3900 leaf images) with 6 diseased classes, potato plant (1,526
    leaf images), and apple plant (2600 leaf images) with 3 diseased classes to examine
    the robustness of DLQP as a texture descriptor. Accuracy rates of 95.6%, 96.2%,
    and 97.8% were obtained for the aforementioned crops, which were higher when compared
    to classification on the same dataset using other standard feature descriptors
    such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Local Ternary Patterns (LTP). Furthermore,
    the proposed method’s effectiveness was demonstrated by comparing it to existing
    algorithms for plant disease phenotyping. The authors of [67] have developed an
    algorithm for detecting and preventing disease spreading to the entire crop, which
    results in excellent quality crop production. The database of various leaf images
    was created and processed using KMC image segmentation, and textural analysis
    of leaf images was performed using GLCM. After ranking their attributes using
    an information gain algorithm, the SVM classifier was used to classify the feature-extracted
    images. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to portray the various
    stages of the image processing algorithm and to detect the two leaf diseases.
    The authors of [68] have proposed a DL-based technique for detecting tomato disease
    that uses the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) to generate synthetic
    images of tomato plant leaves. Following that, a DenseNet121 model was trained
    on synthetic and real images using TL to classify tomato leaf images into ten
    disease categories. The proposed model has been thoroughly trained and tested
    using the publicly available PlantVillage dataset. For tomato leaf image categorization
    into 5 classes, 7 classes, and 10 classes, the suggested method achieved an accuracy
    of 99.51%, 98.65%, and 97.11%, respectively. Accordingly, the proposed methodology
    outperformed the existing methodologies. The authors of [69] have focused on supervised
    machine learning approaches such as NB, DT, KNN, SVM, and RF for maize plant disease
    detection using plant images. The aforementioned classification techniques were
    analyzed and compared to determine the suitable model with the highest accuracy
    for plant disease prediction. When compared to the other classification techniques,
    the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 79.23%. The authors of [70] have
    proposed a new method of assembling TL models to detect rice plants and categorize
    diseases using images. This model detects the three most frequent rice crop diseases:
    brown spot, leaf smut, and bacterial leaf blight. The TL, in general, uses pre-trained
    models and provides higher accuracy for image datasets. Additionally, assembling
    machine learning algorithms (combining two or more ML algorithms) aids in reducing
    generalization errors and making the model more robust. EL was becoming more popular
    since it minimizes generalization errors while also making the model more robust.
    With an accuracy of 96.42%, they proposed a novel model that ensembles three TL
    models: InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. A newly conducted research
    paper microscope called Foldscope was used [71] to identify early blight disease
    in tomato leaves. To assess the severity of early blight disease in tomato leaves,
    the study used a deep residual network 101 (ResNet101) of CNN. The model’s dataset
    was trained using an open database, namely the PlantVillage dataset for mild,
    moderate, and severely infected tomato leaves, as well as healthy tomato leaves.
    The ResNet101 architecture’s performance was compared to that of other pre-trained
    CNN architectures, including Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16), VGG19, GoogleLeNet,
    AlexNet, and ResNet50. The deep ResNet101 architecture achieved the highest accuracy
    of 94.6% among these networks. The authors of [72] have proposed a lightweight
    TL-based technique for detecting disease in tomato leaves. It uses an efficient
    pre-processing method to improve classification by enhancing the leaf images with
    illumination correction. For effective prediction, the system extracts features
    using a hybrid model composed of a pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture and a
    classifier network. To avoid data leaks and handle the class imbalance issue,
    traditional augmentation procedures were substituted by runtime augmentation.
    They trained and tested on the PlantVillage dataset. Finally, the proposed architecture
    attained a 99.30% accuracy. The authors of [73] have developed methods for detecting
    and classifying plant disease using diseased plant leaves. In this study, they
    used four different DL models (InceptionV3, InceptionResnetV2, MobileNetV2, and
    EfficientNetB0) to classify plant diseases using images of healthy and diseased
    plant leaves. They used the standard PlantVillage dataset with 53,407 images recorded
    under laboratory conditions to train and test the classifier. They used accessible
    datasets to train models that included 14 different plant species, 38 different
    categorical disease groups, and healthy plant leaves. Using InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2,
    MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0, the implemented models achieved disease classification
    accuracy rates of 98.42%, 99.11%, 97.02%, and 99.56%, respectively, which was
    higher than that of traditional handcrafted-feature based techniques. Finally,
    EfficientNetB0 achieved the maximum successful classification accuracy of 99.56%,
    with significantly less training time than the InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2,
    and MobileNetV2 designs. A DCNN technique was developed by [74] to integrate an
    attention mechanism that can better adapt to the diagnosis of a range of tomato
    leaf diseases. The network structure that was implemented primarily consists of
    residual blocks and attention extraction modules. The model can extract complex
    aspects of numerous diseases with high accuracy. The dataset was derived from
    the most widely used publicly available PlantVillage dataset. It was also found
    that, when compared to another model, the SE-ResNet50 was better suited for the
    identification of tomato leaf diseases. On the tomato leaf diseases dataset, the
    suggested model achieved an average identification accuracy of 96.81%, according
    to the experiment findings. The authors of [75] have focused on identifying tomato
    plant leaf disease using image processing techniques based on image segmentation,
    clustering, and open-source algorithms. Using the image classifier technique that
    has been implemented, the comparison image was classed as a disease-affected or
    normal leaf. Other algorithms that can be used include ANN, FL, and hybrid algorithms.
    All of this contributes to a reliable, safe, and accurate leaf disease system
    with a focus on tomato plants’ leaves. The method was evaluated using OpenCV,
    one of the most used libraries for computer vision applications. Finally, when
    compared to other neural networks, they attained an accuracy of 98% using the
    proposed technique. The authors of [76] have used a DNN for real-time tomato plant
    leaf disease image classification. They were used to develop a framework that
    uses a series of frameworks to classify the leaf disease, including image acquisition,
    feature extraction, and the tomato plant. The MatLab platforms were used to analyze
    the DNN classification performance on tomato leaves, which consists of 1,500 images
    of healthy and diseased leaves, respectively. The tomato leaf images were well-ranked
    using the DNN DL technique. The DNN results were 86.18% more accurate than existing
    models. The authors of [77] have developed a DL technique for classifying tomato
    plant disease by combining CNN pre-trained models and fine-tuning them. The purpose
    of this work was to use multiple performance indicators to compare the performance
    of AlexNet, GoogleNet, Inception V3, ResNet 18, and ResNet 50. When these models
    were compared, the advantages were that CNNs do not require any tiresome pre-processing
    and have a faster convergence rate and lucrative training results. The model used
    in this study was capable of classifying nine diseases in tomato leaves from the
    healthy class, whereas the GoogleNet model with 22 layers can achieve 99.72% tomato
    disease classification using the TL training method. When compared to the other
    architectures, Inception V3 had the lowest performance. The authors of [78] have
    proposed an advanced classification model to detect and classify tomato leaf disease.
    Before classification with KNN, a training dataset of 450 images was used, and
    image features were retrieved using different models. The AlexNet model had a
    classification accuracy of 76.1%, which was the highest when compared to other
    models. In general, CNNs, such as AlexNet for feature extraction and KNN for classification,
    were used. Using three pre-trained CNN models, the authors of [40] used TL and
    feature extraction techniques to estimate the disease severity of tomato late
    blight disease. The authors of [79] have developed a computer vision way to identify
    the condition by recording leaf images and recognizing the disease’s probability.
    A DL technique was used in this study to develop a robust judgment that spans
    a wide range of leaf appearances. The MobileNet V2, a small DL architecture, has
    been fine-tuned to detect three types of tomato disease. When MobileNet V2 was
    trained using Adagrad with a batch size of 16, it achieved the best classification
    performance. The system was put through its paces on 4,671 images from the PlantVillage
    dataset. The findings suggested that MobileNet V2 can detect the disease with
    greater than 90% accuracy. The authors of [80] have described how to develop a
    hybrid of SVM and LR methods to predict powdery mildew disease in tomato plants.
    The SVM was used here to minimize noise in the data before it was supplied to
    the LR classifier. The adaptive sampling-based noise reduction (ANR) method was
    used to reduce noise using an SVM classifier. In this study, a real-world tomato
    Powdery Mildew Disease (TPMD) dataset was used to create a prediction model using
    the proposed strategy. Individual SVM and LR algorithms were also employed to
    create the prediction models. According to the results, the suggested classifier
    outperformed SVM by 3.06% and LR by 5.35%, with an accuracy of 92.37%. The authors
    of [81] have described a novel plant leaf disease identification model based on
    a DCNN. The DCNN model was trained in this study using an available dataset containing
    39 different classes of plant leaves and background images. They also employed
    six data augmentation techniques: image flipping, gamma correction, noise injection,
    principal component analysis (PCA), color augmentation, rotation, and scaling.
    Different training epochs, batch sizes, and dropouts were used to train the proposed
    model. They also compared them to common TL algorithms; the new model outperformed
    the others when using validation data. The proposed model had a classification
    accuracy of 96.46%. The authors of [82] have proposed a technique that outperformed
    the existing ML approaches in terms of accuracy. They have presented a computer
    vision framework for identifying and classifying plant diseases. The proposed
    technique extracts local tri-directional patterns (LTriDP) from images of plant
    leaves of various types. The classification was done using multiclass SVM, and
    the studies were done on a tomato leaf dataset with five different classes. Finally,
    experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms competing
    approaches based on regularly used feature descriptors, achieving an overall accuracy
    of 94%. The authors of [83] have proposed a DCNN model based on TL to identify
    tomato leaf disease. In this case, the model detects disease by using real-time
    and stored tomato plant images. In addition, the suggested model’s performance
    was evaluated using adaptive moment estimation (Adam), stochastic gradient descent
    (SGD), and RMSprop optimizers. The experimental results showed that the suggested
    model, which used the TL approach, was effective in the automated categorization
    of tomato leaf disease. The suggested model for the Adam optimizer, which uses
    a TL strategy, yields a 99.55% accuracy, which is 0.54% higher than RMSprop and
    17.78% higher than SGD optimizers. The authors of [84] have developed a DL-based
    technique to detect the disease. A CNN-based technique was used here for disease
    detection and classification. There were three convolution layers, three max-pooling
    layers, and two fully linked layers in this model. The experimental findings showed
    that the proposed model outperformed the pre-trained models VGG16, InceptionV3,
    and MobileNet. The classification accuracy varies from 76 to 100% depending on
    the class, and the suggested model’s average accuracy is 91.2% for the 9 diseases
    and 1 healthy class. The authors of [85] have proposed many ML methods and CNN
    models for the identification of tomato crop disease. A simpler CNN model with
    eight hidden layers was proposed. They used the publicly available PlantVillage
    dataset, and the proposed lightweight model outperforms established ML approaches.
    While KNN provides the best accuracy of 94.9% in a traditional ML technique, VGG16
    in pre-trained models achieves the best accuracy of 93.5%. Finally, the proposed
    model outperformed PlantVillage on other datasets, with an accuracy of 98.7%.
    The authors of [86] have provided an overview of various techniques for detecting
    and classifying plant leaf disease. The study found that image processing approaches
    can give an effective and accurate method of classifying plant leaf disease. The
    authors of [87] have used GLCM, KMC, and SVM algorithms to classify diseases on
    images of citrus leaves. Using their proposed strategy, the researchers achieved
    a classification accuracy of 90%. The authors of [88] have developed a method
    for detecting disease using image processing techniques in wheat fields. This
    study has made a significant contribution to the automation of agricultural methods
    and processes. The authors of [89] have developed a computer-aided image-processing
    approach for detecting plant leaf diseases. To classify cucumber leaf diseases,
    the authors have used KMC and SVM classifiers. The researchers in [90] carried
    out a study of five different modern DL models. With an accuracy of 86.799%, ResNet101V2
    produced the best result. The authors of [91] have proposed a model for identifying
    paddy leaf diseases. The authors achieved 97.5% recognition accuracy by combining
    the SVM classifier and DCNN algorithms. The authors of [92] have proposed a model
    to detect groundnut leaf disease using the KNN algorithm. According to the researcher’s
    perspective, plant diseases can be caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and other
    organisms. Plant diseases can be identified using image processing approaches
    based on images of affected leaves [93]. The authors achieved an accuracy of 88.89%
    using SVM and KMC. Agricultural plant diseases that impact farmlands cause a decrease
    in agricultural crop results volume. Early disease detection controls the disease
    and prevents it from spreading throughout the farm [94]. A computerized approach
    for classifying soybean plants was used to develop a decision support system that
    provides users with advice. The categorization accuracy of the authors was 93.79%.
    To identify plant diseases, a new architecture called plant disease detection
    neural network (PDDNN) was a successful detection system for plant diseases using
    a CNN model [95]. Farmers cannot effectively identify plant disease with their
    naked eyes, and if the disease is not uncovered promptly, it may harm the entire
    farmland or even a neighboring farm. Accordingly, modern computer technology is
    required for efficient and early plant leaf disease detection. The architectures
    of CNN were used to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 86.00% for AlexNet
    and GoogleNet techniques. Every country’s economic fortune is determined by the
    quality and quantity of its crop production. By classifying the disease at an
    early stage, production can be considerably increased. According to [96], the
    technology ensures that the naked eye wastes time and resources. The technology
    ensures success by allowing for faster and more accurate identification of plant
    leaf disease. Cotton leaf disease was detected using a DCNN. The authors implemented
    their approach and confusion matrix in MATLAB to classify disease types. Their
    results showed an average accuracy of 96%. The authors of [97] have proposed using
    image processing and artificial neural approaches to identify disease in brinjal
    leaf plants. For segmentation, they used the KMC algorithm, and for classification,
    they used the ANN. The authors of [98] have done a study that used DL to detect
    tomato leaf diseases. To detect tomato plant disease, they used an algorithm that
    ran in real-time. The authors of [99] have used CNN to investigate tomato leaf
    disease. The authors attained a 97% classification accuracy. Monitoring large
    farms with automated approaches can be useful to farmers because it reduces the
    tedious work of close observation by experts. In classifying plant leaf disease,
    automatic systems used image segmentation algorithms [100]. They have used MATLAB
    for experimentation purposes. The authors of [101] have proposed a new image identification
    system based on several linear regressions and an enhanced histogram segmentation
    algorithm. Their method worked well since the appropriate threshold could be determined
    automatically. It was important to use digital image processing for vision-based
    automated prediction of crop plant diseases [102]. The KMC algorithm was used
    for color segmentation, and the GLCM technique was used for classification. Here,
    good results and promising performances were achieved. The authors proposed that
    their technique reduces detection time and labor costs. Using computerized imaging
    technologies, early detection and identification of plant leaf disease can aid
    in enhancing agricultural production [103]. The authors examined various ways
    of detecting leaf plant diseases used by previous researches. Their research provides
    a critical analysis of various image classification algorithms. To identify crop
    plant diseases, many disease recognition approaches have been used. Different
    strategies have been used to increase disease classification recognition rates
    [104]. When it comes to accurately identifying plant diseases, farmers have limited
    knowledge. According to recent studies, computerized image classification systems
    based on CNN structure can aid in addressing the issue of erroneous identifications.
    According to [105] datasets for rice plant disease are not easily available. The
    authors developed their small dataset and achieved a 92.46% accuracy. The authors
    in [106] have written research that highlights the importance of using image processing
    techniques to detect plant diseases using images of infected leaves. The researchers
    developed a software system solution for automatically detecting and classifying
    images. They have discussed the steps involved in the classifying process, from
    loading the images to identifying the disease. Farmers lack a full understanding
    of leaf plant diseases and must be guided on how to apply computerized image processing
    methods [107]. The researchers proposed a solution that works with Android applications.
    The model provides an efficient method for detecting and classifying plant diseases.
    The CNN was used by the proposed system to classify plant leaf diseases. Accordingly,
    DL-based disease identification in plants and pests poses a variety of issues
    in the future. However, feasible answers and general suggestions can be obtained
    through the practical implementation of different plant leaf disease detection
    technologies. Adopting technology is required to address the challenges of recognizing
    and analyzing plant diseases [108]. The authors proposed a system for processing
    and classifying potato leaf disease images that used various Classifier algorithms
    to achieve 97.00% classification accuracy. The authors of [109] have developed
    a methodology for developing a CNN-based strategy for detecting and identifying
    plant leaf disease. The CNN and DNN can be used to swiftly and effectively identify
    crop diseases and their symptoms. The authors of [110] have designed a system
    that classified guava leaf diseases using a DCNN technique. Their solution achieved
    98.74% accuracy by using the AlexNet strategy based on the DCNN model. The authors
    of [111] have used Inception v3 to develop such an identification model. Three
    classification metrics were used to evaluate the proposed model. The authors reviewed
    the identification of plant diseases. They also established that the CNN technique
    had a higher capacity to produce accurate results. According to [112],14 plant
    types and 26 diseases were used to develop a CNN approach for detecting plant
    diseases. Using AlexNet and GoogleNet, the model obtained a testing accuracy of
    99.35%. The authors of [113] have used ANN to develop a model with an 80% classification
    accuracy on cotton leaf. ANN has been used to classify plant leaf diseases by
    different researchers. The authors of [114] have carried out a study that used
    ANN on 169 images. Their approach had a 92% accuracy rate. Another comparative
    study was carried out by [115]. Here, various neural networks that have previously
    been used by various researchers have been investigated and reviewed. The authors
    established that the most widely used neural networks were ANN and CNN. DL algorithms
    were accurate in classifying plant diseases. The authors of [116] used CNN to
    identify diseases in various crop plants with a 98% accuracy. The authors of [117]
    have used MATLAB to perform research on the automatic classification of plant
    leaf diseases. The authors experimented on beans and tea leaves, achieving accuracy
    rates of 98.2% and 98.4%, respectively. The authors of [118] have conducted a
    review on the identification of plant leaf diseases using digital image processing
    approaches. The efficiency of various image processing algorithms has been highlighted.
    According to the author’s point of view, most researchers prefer neural networks
    to other methods. The authors of [119] have studied groundnut leaf disease using
    the backpropagation approach to classify four types of diseases. Their work was
    97% accurate. The authors of [120] have conducted an extensive review of recent
    work on plant leaf disease classification using digital image processing technologies.
    The authors demonstrate that DL methods outperformed conventional approaches when
    large amounts of data are available. When it comes to plant leaf disease, neural
    network classifiers produce greater output and efficiency [121]. The authors have
    used multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) to study the
    wall of Phyllanthus Elegans. Their approaches provided 90.15% and 98.85% accuracy,
    respectively. The authors of [122] have experimented with four different diseases
    using cotton and soybean leaves: angular leaf spot, bacterial pustule, bacterial
    gummosis, and bacterial blight. They were achieved 83%, 80%, 80%, and 70%, respectively.
    A study on plant leaf disease recognition using CNN and a Bayesian algorithm was
    performed by [123]. The authors achieved an overall accuracy of 98.9% by using
    over 20,000 images of potato, tomato, and pepper bells. The authors of [124] have
    investigated four grape plant diseases: leaf blight, black rot, stable, and black
    measles. The authors achieved a total accuracy of 98.7% by combining hybrid CNN
    with feature reduction. Automatic identification of plant leaf disease using plant
    leaves was critical in farming. The authors [125] attained a 96% overall accuracy.
    Using pattern recognition, researchers in [126] reached an accuracy of 90% in
    the classification of apple leaf disease. The authors of [127] have proposed an
    automated strategy for identifying paddy leaf diseases using ML and evolutionary
    techniques. The model can be used on the Android platform to quickly identify
    diseases. According to [128] a customized CNN-based maize plant disease identification
    model was presented, along with various preprocessing techniques, including contrast-limiting
    adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) on each RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) channel,
    log transformation, and RGB to HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Variance) image conversion.
    These trained models were compared to CNN and SVM models that were trained without
    any preprocessing procedures. The experiments were carried out using the PlantVillage
    maize crop dataset to determine the effectiveness of the proposed effort. The
    proposed work had a maximum accuracy of 99.76%. The authors of [129] have achieved
    an overall accuracy of 98.39% when using GA to classify and analyze unhealthy
    grape plant leaves. A survey was conducted in [130] to examine several image classification
    methods that can be used to identify diseases of plant leaves. The authors of
    [131] have researched different DL approaches used in the classification of plant
    leaf diseases. The authors used the Weka tool to present a thorough examination
    of numerous techniques. The authors of [132] have used the NB classification method
    to develop a model that can identify diseased sections of plant leaves with an
    overall accuracy of 97%. The authors of [133] have used the NB algorithm to classify
    plant leaves. The authors fed the shape and texture of the leaves into the classifier.
    The CNN model outperformed other classifiers such as KNN, RF, SVM, and DT [134].
    The authors achieved 99.58% and 97.66% accuracy in identifying paddy and potato
    leaf diseases, respectively. Using CNN, the authors of [135] have developed a
    system that provides a report on detecting banana leaf disease. The authors of
    [136] have proposed three CNN models to identify guava leaf disease. Here, the
    third model produced an overall accuracy of 95.61%. The authors of [137] have
    developed an ML-based technique for detecting and identifying potato leaf disease.
    The model’s overall accuracy was 95.99%. According to [138], a model for classifying
    bean leaf diseases was developed. The authors achieved 97% training accuracy and
    92% testing accuracy. The authors of [139] have proposed a system for detecting
    maize leaf disease using improved DCNN. Using DCNN, the authors of [140] developed
    a method for detecting and classifying purple blotch disease in onions. The accuracy
    of the model was 85.47%. Several DL models for detecting and identifying plant
    leaf diseases have been developed. DL algorithms that offer more accuracy make
    this subject of research interesting [20]. ML and DL technologies have been used
    in agriculture to increase the product while addressing difficulties [141]. To
    classify plant leaf diseases, the authors of [142] have presented an attention-based
    depth-wise neural network with Bayesian optimization (ADSNN-BO). An accuracy of
    94.65% was obtained. Using the RF technique, researchers have proposed a model
    that can detect and classify maize disease. An automatic method for the classification
    of plant diseases based on the RF algorithm was developed by [143]. The proposed
    model had a 95% accuracy rate. The authors of [144] developed a hybrid learning
    model for plant leaf classification. To identify plant leaf diseases, the model
    used KMC and CNN methods. The model outperformed SVM and CNN with an accuracy
    of 92.6%. The authors of [145] have used image SVM to identify sugarcane leaf
    disease and achieved a classification accuracy of 95%. The authors of [97] have
    used ANN and KNN approaches to develop a model to identify and classify cassava
    leaf disease. The model in [146] achieved a classification accuracy of more than
    90%. In the work of [147] the DL and ML techniques were proposed and used to solve
    binary and multiclass subcategories of plant diseases on four different datasets.
    The proposed approach produces improved results, with 99.4% accuracy and 99.9%
    sensitivity for binary classes, and 99.2% accuracy for multiclass. In terms of
    f-measure, recall, MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient), specificity, and sensitivity,
    the proposed framework outperformed previous approaches such as LibSVM, SMO (sequential
    minimal optimization), and DL with activation functions softmax and soft sign.
    The authors of [148] have focused on the issue and present a DL-based technique
    for disease detection and classification in maize crops. Furthermore, the developed
    technique returns segmented images of affected leaves, allowing them to follow
    the disease spots on each leaf. A dataset of three maize crop diseases blight,
    sugarcane mosaic virus, and leaf spot was collected from the University Research
    Farm Koont, PMAS-AAUR, during different growth stages and under different weather
    conditions. The data was used to train different models for prediction, such as
    YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7s, and YOLOv8n, with stated prediction accuracy
    of 69.40%, 97.50%, 88.23%, 93.30%, and 99.04%. The results showed that the YOLOv8n
    model outperformed the other models in terms of prediction accuracy. With a higher
    confidence score, this model produced good results in properly localizing the
    afflicted portion of the leaf. Furthermore, the high-accuracy models have been
    implemented in a smartphone application to give end users real-time disease detection
    in a matter of seconds. The authors of [149] have proposed an automated DL with
    a wavelet neural network (ADLWNN) model that focuses on the effective detection
    and classification of rice plants. To extract features from the input rice plant
    images, the proposed ADLWNN model principally employed a CNN model. Furthermore,
    the manta ray optimization algorithm (MRFO) was used as a hyperparameter optimizer.
    Furthermore, the WNN model was used for the accurate detection and classification
    of rice plant images. The simulation analysis of the ADLWNN model was tested using
    a set of rice plant images, and the findings showed that the ADLWNN model outperformed
    other methodologies by 98.17%. The authors of [150] have provided a fully automated
    coffee leaf disease detection framework based on a modified color process in which
    the syndrome is self-clustered using an extended Gaussian kernel density estimate
    and the likelihood of the nearest common neighborhood. Accordingly, the proposed
    extended Gaussian kernel, which joins nearby lesions in one symptom cluster without
    the necessity for any influencing set that guides towards the correct cluster,
    yielded the best probabilities. Clusters are provided with the same priority as
    a kernel density estimation (KDE) with the ResNet50 classifier, reducing misclassification
    with an accuracy of up to 98%. To identify plant diseases, residual attention
    learning has been proposed. The work makes use of four different datasets [151]
    the residual attention network (Res-ATTEN) is used to compute attention-aware
    characteristics in the system. The proposed technique has reached state-of-the-art
    performance, with 99% for apples and rice, 94% for corn, and 97% for grapes. The
    DeepPlantNet DL-based architecture has been proposed, and the study was efficient,
    unique, and lightweight for predicting and categorizing plant leaf diseases [152].
    The DeepPlantNet model suggested consists of 28 learned layers, 25 convolutional
    layers (ConV), and three fully connected (FC) layers. It was a unique plant disease
    classification system that used Leaky RelU (LReLU), batch normalization (BN),
    fire modules, and a mix of 33 and 11 filters. The proposed DeepPlantNet model
    can classify plant disease photos into a variety of categories. The proposed method
    divides plant diseases into the ten categories listed below: peach_bacterial_spot
    (PBS), pepper_bell_bacterial_spot (PBBS), potato_early_blight (PEB), squash_powdery_mildew
    (SPM), strawberry_leaf_scorch (SLS), bacterial tomato spot (TBS), and maize common
    rust (MCR). In the case of eight-class and three-class classification schemes,
    the proposed framework attained average accuracy of 98.49 and 99.85, respectively.
    The authors of [153] have proposed a PDD framework (i.e., PDD-Net) based on CNN,
    which leverages data augmentation techniques and includes multilevel and multiscale
    features to produce a class and scale-invariant architecture. The flatten-t swish
    (FTS) activation function was used to prevent gradient disappearing and explosion
    difficulties during PDD-Net training, while the focused loss function was used
    to alleviate the impact of class imbalance. On the PlantVillage dataset, the PDD-Net
    technique beats baseline models, attaining an average precision of 92.06%, recall
    of 92.71%, F1 score of 92.36%, and accuracy of 93.79%. On the cassava leaf disease
    dataset, it achieves an average precision of 86.41%, recall of 85.77%, F1 score
    of 86.02%, and accuracy of 86.98%. These findings indicate PDD-Net’s efficiency
    and resilience in plant disease diagnosis. Early detection of plant diseases is
    critical because they inflict social, ecological, and economic costs [154]. In
    this study, four well-known CNN models (MobileNetV3Small, EfficientNetV2L, InceptionV3,
    and MobileNetV2) are used in addition to the suggested two novel CNN models. The
    experimental results show that the suggested ensemble models stand out for their
    quick training and testing times, as well as their excellent classification performances
    with a 99.60% accuracy. The authors of [155] have proposed a DNSVM classification
    technique that combines DenseNet-201 with SVM to identify plant leaf diseases.
    The PlantVillage dataset had good variations, color differences, differences in
    orientation, and leaf size. Sugarcane plant leaves were employed for the suggested
    model’s performance examination, and it achieved 97.78% classification accuracy
    above the previous DenseNet-121-based classifier model (94%). The authors of [156]
    have suggested two DL techniques for palm leaf disease classification: residual
    network (ResNet) and inception ResNet TL. The models enable the training of hundreds
    of layers while achieving excellent performance. Given the value of their excellent
    representation ability, the performance of image classification using ResNet has
    improved, such as in the disease classification of plant leaves. Both approaches
    addressed issues such as brightness and backdrop variance, image scale variation,
    and inter-class similarity. The date palm dataset, which included 2,631 colored
    images of varying sizes, was utilized to train and test the models. Using certain
    well-known measures, the suggested models surpassed many prior studies in the
    field in both original and augmented datasets, achieving an accuracy of 99.62%
    and 100%, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the DL and ML-based implemented plant
    leaf and/or crop species disease detection and classification research works including
    the type (s) of plant, used techniques/models/algorithms, and accuracies. Table

    Performance evaluation of plant disease detection and classification Since agriculture
    is a significant part of the population around the globe, a comprehensive research
    study on several types of DL and ML approaches for different plant leaf and/or
    crop disease detection and classification has been implemented. Following that,
    different classification techniques in the DL and ML approaches may be utilized
    for plant disease detection and classification, to assist farmers with automatic
    disease detection and classification of all types of disease in the crop that
    were to be identified [162]. The distribution of relevant papers over the years
    has been depicted in Fig. 5. The Figure shows an increase in plant leaf and/or
    crop disease detection and classification over the years. Fig. 5 Distribution
    of plant leaf and/or crop disease detection and classification research papers
    per year (i.e., for this particular study) Full size image Accurately detecting
    and classifying different plant disease occurrence at an early stage is critical
    for crop quality and result through the selection of appropriate treatments [150,
    163]. The detection of such diseases on a large scale in a timely and accurate
    way is prone to human error [164, 165]. Accordingly, ML and DL techniques offer
    possibilities for developing automated models that can detect such diseases promptly.
    However, disease identification and classification necessitate specialized knowledge
    and extensive experience in plant pathology. Thus, by developing an early detection
    and classification system for disease, an automated system for disease detection
    in crops will play an essential role in agricultural industries. Automatic plant
    disease detection and classification is an interesting study area since it may
    be useful for monitoring enormous fields and, hence, the automatic identification
    and classification of disease by symptoms in different plant sections [166]. Image
    dataset size, class numbers, preprocessing techniques, classification approaches,
    performance analysis, and so on are examples of these measurements. The previous
    decade’s research was thoroughly reviewed, including studies on several plant
    diseases, and an investigation of the important features was provided. This work
    contributes by comparing the automated detection and classification of various
    plant diseases through the use of image processing, DL, ML, and meta-heuristic
    optimization techniques. The study gives information on many methods used to identify
    diseases in various plants. The study’s various elements include the type of segmentation,
    dividing technology, extracted features, dataset size and year of publication,
    disease category, methodologies, detection accuracy, classification, and constraints
    accordingly. Evaluation metrics The application of DL approaches to detect and
    classify plant diseases can avoid the disadvantages of artificial selection of
    disease spot features, making plant disease feature extraction more objective,
    and increasing research performances and technology transformation speed [167].
    The researchers in the literature have measured their proposed techniques by using
    different performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean average precision
    (mAP), recall, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity, and specificity
    [62]. Equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) are defined and describe
    how to evaluate the performances of the plant disease detection and classification
    techniques. A. Accuracy The accuracy score of a model, often known as accuracy,
    is a classification statistic in DL and ML techniques that represents the proportion
    of correct predictions made by the model. (1) B. mAP When the Intersection over
    Union (IOU) is greater than or equal to the threshold, mAP is the accuracy. It
    is the ratio of a true and predicted region of interests’ intersection area to
    the union of the same. At different thresholds, detection performance is measured
    in thresholds of mAP. (2) where AP denotes the average precision of each class
    and q is the query or test image. Q is the total number of test images: C. Recall
    A model’s recall is defined as the model’s ability to correctly identify True
    Positives. It is defined as the ratio of correctly classified positive outputs
    to correctly classified outputs. (3) D Precision Precision is defined as the ability
    to identify only relevant objects. It is defined as the ratio of correctly classified
    positive outputs to total positive outputs. (4) E. F1-score The f1 score is also
    introduced to assess the model’s accuracy. The f1-score considers both the model’s
    precision and recall [34]. (5) F. intersection over union (IoU) (6) G. Sensitivity
    (7) H. Specificity (8) where TP, TN, FP, and FN are for True Positive, True Negative,
    False Positive, and False Negative respectively. In addition to the above performance
    evaluation metrics, determining the performances of the plant leaf and /or crop
    disease detection and classification performance should be evaluated in terms
    of the Logarithmic Loss (including the training loss, validation loss, and testing
    loss) and Area Under Curve (AUC) metrics accordingly. As indicated in [62], designing
    an effective logarithmic loss function is mandatory for the robust performance
    of plant leaf and /or crop disease detection and classification models. Results
    and discussions A comparative review of different research works done in different
    plant leaf disease detection and classification using DL and ML techniques has
    been investigated by many researchers. Accordingly, when sufficient data is available
    for training, DL techniques are capable of detecting and classifying plant leaf
    diseases with high accuracy. As indicated in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9, different researchers
    have developed plant leave disease detection and classification systems by using
    plant leave images. Here, most of the researchers have tested their proposed systems
    on different plant leaves. They have computed the evaluation metrics such as accuracy,
    precision, recall, f1-score, mAP, IoU, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews
    correlation coefficient (MCC) for training and testing purposes. Accordingly,
    for this particular comparative study, the author has considered only the accuracy
    of the literature. Additionally, the maximum accuracy (including multiclass level
    accuracies accordingly) result has been considered in plant leaf disease detection
    and classification research work that has been tested on different plant leaves
    in the literature. Fig. 6 Performances of the DL and ML techniques in the study

    c Full size image Fig. 9 Performances of the DL and ML techniques in the study
    d Full size image As depicted in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9, CNNs are generally superior
    to SVMs for plant leaf disease detection and classification tasks by using the
    images of plants accordingly. CNNs are specifically designed for handling image
    data, as they can automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel values.
    They use convolutional layers to capture local patterns and hierarchical representations,
    enabling them to excel at tasks like object recognition, image detection, and
    classification. DL and ML both have roles in image detection and classification.
    ML techniques like SVMs may be sufficient for simple image detection and classification
    tasks with well-defined features. However, DL, including CNNs, is typically more
    powerful and versatile for complex image tasks. DL models can automatically learn
    intricate features and representations, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
    Hence, for most modern image detection classification tasks, DL, particularly
    CNNs, is the preferred choice due to their ability to outperform traditional ML
    techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency [161]. CNNs are often the favored
    choice for image detection and classification due to their inherent capacity to
    autonomously acquire pertinent image features and grasp spatial hierarchies. Nevertheless,
    the selection between conventional ML and DL hinges on the particular problem,
    the accessibility of data, and the computational capabilities accessible. In numerous
    advanced image detection and classification tasks, DL, mainly through CNNs, is
    preferred when ample data and computational resources are available. The significance
    of collecting large datasets with high variability, data augmentation, transfer
    learning, and visualization of CNN activation maps in improving detection and
    classification accuracies, as well as the significance of small sample plant leaf
    disease detection, classification, and hyper-spectral imaging for early detection
    and classification of plant disease, have all been mandatory activities to increase
    the best results of agricultural products [62]. Most of the DL frameworks proposed
    in the study showed good detection and classification effects on their datasets
    but not on other datasets, indicating that the model is not good. As a result,
    more robust DL models are required to adapt to the different disease datasets.
    The PlantVillage dataset was used to evaluate the performance of both DL and ML
    techniques in most of the studies. Although the dataset contains several images
    of various plant species with diseases, they were all taken in the lab. As a result,
    a large dataset of plant diseases in real-world situations is expected. Although
    some researchers use hyperspectral images of diseased leaves and different DL
    and ML frameworks for the early detection and classification of plant leaf diseases,
    issues that affect the widespread use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the early
    detection and classification of plant diseases have yet to be resolved [168].
    That is, it is difficult to get labeled datasets for early plant disease detection
    and classification, and even experienced experts cannot mark where the invisible
    disease symptoms are and define purely invisible disease pixels, which is critical
    for HSI to detect plant disease. The analysis of the reviewed papers revealed
    that the detection and classification of plant disease is a hot issue and needs
    further investigation. The detection and classification of plant leaf disease
    for different crops are a pressing issue and a complex process, partly due to
    the availability of datasets and the task of developing an ML model with rigid
    performance. As depicted in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9 below, based on the reviewed
    research works in the area, most researchers have achieved better evaluation results
    with the DL technique than with the ML technique for developing plant disease
    detection and classification systems. Additionally, most researchers have combined
    different techniques, such as DL and ML, to detect and classify various plant
    leaves. Accordingly, though SVM has excellent performance in image detection and
    classification, its performance depends on the image features it receives. It
    is suggested to combine CNN features with the SVM classifier unless the researchers
    plan to use pre-trained models. As depicted in Fig. 10, most of the studies that
    have been included in this particular study have concentrated on the detection
    and classification of different diseases in tomato and rice crops, respectively.
    In addition to the tomato and rice crops, the researchers have tried to conduct
    disease detection and classification studies on different plant leaves and/or
    crop species accordingly. Fig. 10 Distribution of the studies per plant leaf and/or
    crop species (i.e., for this particular study) Full size image Currently, plant
    leaf and/or crop species disease detection and classification studies have been
    implemented and tested using different techniques and approaches for multiple
    plant leaf and/or crop species accordingly. As summarized in Fig. 11, plant leaf
    and/or crop species disease detection and classification techniques and approaches
    have been implemented for more than two plants. From Fig. 11, the Apple, Blueberry,
    Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper Bell, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash,
    Strawberry, and Tomato plant leaf and/or crop species have been implemented and
    tested by the CNN technique and achieved an overall accuracy of 99.35%. Fig. 11
    Distribution of the studies per multiple plant leaf and/or crop species Full size
    image Additionally, most of the researchers have tried to include the tomato plant
    in the selected plant leaf and/or crop species disease detection and classification
    research works. This indicates that the tomato plant is the most researchable
    plant leaf and/or crop species. Conclusion and recommendation The literature provided
    many strategies that have been developed and made available to aid in the achievement
    of enormous accomplishments in the fields of ML, DL, and image processing. The
    assessment also stated that the percentage accuracy can be enhanced by training
    and testing the models with more and more datasets to boost the classification
    and identification accuracy. To address the problem of plant leaf or crop disease,
    new and better DL algorithms that can provide higher accuracy in identifying and
    classifying plant leaf or crop diseases must always be developed and applied.
    Several methods for classifying plant leaf diseases have been developed and used
    in the past. However, neural networks, such as CNN, appear to be the ideal technique
    for classifying plant diseases due to their flexibility and feature extractor
    property, which allows them to extract features automatically. Unlike prior models
    such as NB, KNN, SVM, RFC, and others, CNN may learn extra features from images
    to produce superior results. Because of their sophistication in learning and extracting
    information from images for trustworthy output, neural networks such as CNN are
    well suited for research work in the areas of computer vision and image processing.
    In addition, from the DL and ML techniques that have been included in this particular
    study, CNNs are often the favored choice for image detection and classification
    due to their inherent capacity to autonomously acquire pertinent image features
    and grasp spatial hierarchies. Nevertheless, the selection between conventional
    ML and DL hinges upon the particular problem, the accessibility of data, and the
    computational capabilities accessible. Accordingly, in numerous advanced image
    detection and classification tasks, DL, mainly through CNNs, is preferred when
    ample data and computational resources are available and show good detection and
    classification effects on their datasets, but not on other datasets. Finally,
    the author recommends future researchers to investigate plant disease detection
    and classification research works by considering the following points accordingly:
    Developing DL models for disease detection and classification in different parts
    of plants. To improve the robustness of homemade datasets in complicated contexts,
    an automated parameter search technique for the weather data augmentation method
    should be developed. Data augmentation, large datasets with significant variability,
    and other strategies can increase plant disease detection and classification accuracies.
    Expanding the recommended techniques will result in a significant contribution
    to sustainable agriculture, influencing crop quality for future generations. Using
    preprocessing techniques on the dataset, such as resizing and augmentation. DL
    models for real-time disease detection are being developed. Development of an
    Android app that detects the presence of diseases on different plants using a
    DL model. Develop such plant leave detection and classification systems by combining
    DL and ML techniques such as DCCN and CNN features with SVM techniques. Availability
    of data and materials The research data are available from the authors and can
    be accessed from the author accordingly. References Tirkey D, Singh KK, Tripathi

  description: Machine learning (ML) is the buzz all around the technology industry
    and is illuminating each and every sector of human lives, be it, healthcare, finance,
    bioinformatics, data science, mechanical engineering, agriculture or even smart
    cities nowadays. ML consists of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Due to
    the availability of data in abundance, supervised ML has been the most preferred
    method in the field of data mining. In this research paper, a publicly available
    dataset for diabetes detection is tested to understand the efficiency of classification
    of a number of supervised ML algorithms to find the most accurate model. The dataset
    consisted of data of 768 persons out of which 500 were control and 268 were patients
    we found that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the other 6 classification
    algorithm. In the first iteration, the Random Forest algorithm reached 78.44%
    accuracy. The tweaks performed in the paper outclassed the original random forest
    algorithm with a difference of 1.08% reaching a score of 79.52%. Further, iteration
    I gave 171 whilst iteration II gave 173 correct predictions out of the total 218
    test data.

    and is illuminating each and every sector of human lives, be it, healthcare, finance,
    bioinformatics, data science, mechanical engineering, agriculture or even smart
    cities nowadays. ML consists of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Due to
    the availability of data in abundance, supervised ML has been the most preferred
    method in the field of data mining. In this research paper, a publicly available
    dataset for diabetes detection is tested to understand the efficiency of classification
    of a number of supervised ML algorithms to find the most accurate model. The dataset
    consisted of data of 768 persons out of which 500 were control and 268 were patients
    we found that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the other 6 classification
    algorithm. In the first iteration, the Random Forest algorithm reached 78.44%
    accuracy. The tweaks performed in the paper outclassed the original random forest
    algorithm with a difference of 1.08% reaching a score of 79.52%. Further, iteration
    I gave 171 whilst iteration II gave 173 correct predictions out of the total 218

    Unit (GRU) 1. Introduction India has agriculture as its primary occupation. IBEF
    (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that 58 % of Indians who live in rural
    areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped countries but also in
    many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make up a significant component
    of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018). As a result, it is urgent
    that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will help handle global catastrophes
    like climate change and epidemics like draught in addition to fostering the flourishing
    sustainable development of people, flora, and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers
    still use traditional methods such as manual field monitoring, which involves
    often watering crops and applying pesticides to manage pests, whether or not they
    are aware of the appropriate dosage. These old methods include disadvantages such
    as water logging in fields, excessive use of pesticides and fungicides, lack of
    knowledge about the kind of crops that need to be cultivated for a certain type
    of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated from the agricultural area
    (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue to cultivate using traditional
    techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth & Sujatha, 2018). Better
    technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood of famine and malnutrition.
    The technology should be inexpensive enough that it can have an influence on billions
    of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring
    of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature, as well as the management of the
    infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary for agricultural production.
    IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur et al., 2020). Since they
    are utilised to offer information about agricultural areas, all Internet of Things
    sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture stick advertises the novel smart
    agriculture programme based on IoT that enables farmers to have access to real-time
    data to track how the environment is operating, enabling them to engage in smart
    farming, increase their final yield, and ensure that their product meets quality
    standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless sensor network is used by this advanced
    agricultural monitoring system to gather data from a number of sensors placed
    at various junctions. A great amount of data can be analysed using such technology
    in precision farming after being collected by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables
    farmers to boost yields while using fewer resources. In industrialised countries,
    smart framing is being carried out on a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture
    data analysis (Goel et al., 2021). The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture
    system demonstrated that distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and
    that micro-scale controllers are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote
    sensing systems, including those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras
    (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020). Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in
    the greenhouse, as well as illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the
    aid of precision farming (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be
    impacted by a variety of external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences
    (Gunjan et al., 2022). Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both
    impacted by temperature and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms
    of the effectiveness of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural
    production illnesses (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions
    are favourable, controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing
    crops in greenhouses, it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments
    or drip system cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al.,
    2022). Understanding the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient
    solutions should be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose
    of this paper is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture
    using IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The
    main contribution of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient
    field monitoring model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology
    to support farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled
    in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit
    it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing
    value imputation are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to
    forecast weather and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian
    filter and dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques
    and CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image.
    • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases
    to render control action. Rest of the paper contains: Section 2 presents the literature
    review related to automated field monitoring. In Section 3 proposed methodology
    and architecture of the proposed methodology are given. Result and discussion
    part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains
    the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting
    of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines
    some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease
    prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system
    An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and
    open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system''s
    intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well
    as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature,
    humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan
    (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast
    how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created
    and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information
    visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor
    node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have
    suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques
    are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture
    of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting
    future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al.
    (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring
    system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique
    for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies,
    including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and
    are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour
    in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting
    rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising
    IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et
    al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated,
    in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous
    sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and
    plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor
    network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method
    that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450
    m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir
    Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and
    machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating
    the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless
    sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local
    poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological
    advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid
    deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for
    crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of
    three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images
    were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing
    process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach
    achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning
    model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In
    traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming
    due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object
    segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing
    disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for
    detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction
    approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such
    as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was
    recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet
    B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further
    reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous
    systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above
    mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting
    and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting
    system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter
    (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus
    effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the
    current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated
    and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the
    most important economic sectors is agriculture. India''s increased agricultural
    activity can be attributed to the country''s abundant irrigation-supporting water
    supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the
    production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned
    issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved
    automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research.

    Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture.
    The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather
    real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of
    the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests,
    diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The
    information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally
    in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as
    input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then,
    in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence
    of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive
    Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for
    contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50
    for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case
    of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be
    automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding
    the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message
    will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can
    support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser
    time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together
    a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor
    network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data
    over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling
    the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure.

    Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field
    or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and
    field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all
    communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM
    and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors,
    water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules
    are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and
    significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry
    pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage
    on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be
    displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish
    what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the
    server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The
    basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis
    for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections
    need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of
    digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins.
    After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of
    the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial
    phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details
    Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be
    an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each
    node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11
    sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below
    contains each node''s block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node.
    In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user
    in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the
    sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a
    cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI
    system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation,
    and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take
    corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However
    in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature,
    humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring
    (a) Data pre-processing The sensors'' entire collection of data has to be evaluated
    and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and
    soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing
    value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into
    meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally,
    attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified
    range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in
    a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize
    the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given
    in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value
    of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation
    Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple
    imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable
    to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This
    rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection
    between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach
    should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed
    for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean,
    and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number
    of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier
    is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories.
    In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and
    is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive
    description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because
    it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020).
    From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is
    in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which
    contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the
    data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and
    one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer''s output processed data
    is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the
    decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate
    . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory
    cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate
    them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity
    compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU''s organisational structure.
    Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download

    the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated
    using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated
    by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU
    network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture
    area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors'' entire
    collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected
    from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for
    certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert
    the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram
    equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image
    for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional
    Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the
    image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the
    image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals,
    the filter operator smoothes the image''s edges while suppressing the noise, which
    affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering
    algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian
    filter based on the disparity between the pixel''s grey value and the grey mean
    in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written
    as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference
    between the noise-affected pixel''s grey value also its neighbouring pixels is
    described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D,
    the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image
    pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the
    degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image''s
    total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by
    the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram
    equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages
    of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for
    the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions
    are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar
    to how a global histogram is equalised, each image''s histogram is equalised using
    the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as
    in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity
    level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on
    the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the
    fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises
    data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50
    a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network
    (ResNet50) The goal of CNN''s back propagation method is to automatically discover
    the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected
    (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The
    process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the
    foundation of the convolutional layer''s operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5
    × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to
    it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created
    as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on
    activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et
    al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The
    ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix
    bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves
    image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining
    image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter''s
    spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as
    input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the
    pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding
    stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights
    also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for
    mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13),
    the FC layer''s processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN
    model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset.
    Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture
    made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in
    that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more
    customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is
    a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the
    ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that
    must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate
    the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for
    gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current
    layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath
    & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the
    training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies
    the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach
    is further used for the purpose of monitoring the agriculture field. Download

    fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the
    smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically
    start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down
    then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are
    then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization
    machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the
    plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer
    will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module
    to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device
    about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute
    significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries.
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical
    matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity
    for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated
    and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning
    approach. The proposed GRU and ResNet50 are tested on MATLAB 2021a with intel
    core i5 and 8 GB RAM. Simulation parameters for GRU and ResNet50 are given in

    Period 10 The installation of a wireless sensor network is the first step in the
    implementation of weather forecasting and field monitoring. In order to gather
    real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural
    field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions,
    soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil,
    and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants
    and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node
    or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor
    nodes and sensor node deployment used for this proposed approach is illustrated

    purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease
    is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to
    achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial
    action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed
    in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to
    perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system
    to predict weather, crop disease, soil nutrition and irrigation support. Four
    different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description
    regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details
    regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops,
    production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021
    and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India.
    Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose
    of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered
    using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing
    the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims
    to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the
    pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system,
    the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface
    with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3:
    Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and
    farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the
    soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity
    (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset

    number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains
    healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar.

    moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for
    predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing
    classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used
    for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision,
    recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot
    of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness
    of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC
    (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of
    separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close
    to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve
    that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table

    4.3. Disease prediction Crop images (Dataset 4) acquired from sensor nodes are
    used to predict the presence of diseases and pests. The crop diseases dataset
    contains a total of 3995 images, in that 1987 images are disease affected and

    % are used for training and 20 % are used for testing. The acquired crop images
    are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter and Dynamic Histogram Equalization.
    The pre-processed image is then fed into ReNet50 for feature extraction and classification.

    The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor.
    When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to
    35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19
    to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun''s
    effect. Because of the sun''s heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so
    to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed
    on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in
    the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions
    and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper
    oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch
    on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message
    as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”.
    Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system
    as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends
    that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer
    named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the
    pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5.
    Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep
    learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results
    in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected
    through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting
    and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops
    with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled
    in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit
    it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture
    information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture
    images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather
    forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value
    imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was
    then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil
    moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired
    from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive
    Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve
    the image''s brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for
    feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible
    weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial
    action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information
    regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert
    message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed
    approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy,
    precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94
    %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached
    for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning
    techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather
    forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future,
    by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders.

  description: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is considered the next advancement
    in artificial intelligence due to its commitment to delivering high-performance
    end-to-end machine learning pipelines with minimal user input. Although AutoML
    has demonstrated significant potential in computer vision tasks, as far as current
    knowledge extends, there is currently no study that has applied AutoML specifically
    to hyperspectral imaging for fertilization level classification. To address this
    information gap, the use of AutoML for classifying fertilization levels using
    a hyperspectral and CIELAB color space dataset was investigated. A comparative
    analysis was conducted between the performance of an open-source AutoML framework,
    PyCaret, and traditional machine learning using the PLS-DA algorithm. PyCaret
    achieved the highest accuracy (1.00) in classifying different fertilization levels
    using the hyperspectral dataset, while PLS-DA attained an accuracy of 0.91. However,
    the CIELAB dataset was not as effective for this classification task, achieving
    an accuracy of only 0.72. It is worth noting that the hyperspectral dataset outperformed
    the CIELAB dataset in both AutoML and PLS-DA analyses. Finally, the findings suggest
    that AutoML holds substantial potential to enhance the use of hyperspectral imaging
    in agriculture, particularly for fertilization tasks.

    Vector Machine VNIR Visible and Near-Infrared Introduction Efficient plant fertilization
    is crucial in modern agriculture. Fertilization is known to increase yield and
    quality, and it was one of the main driving forces of the Green Revolution [1].
    However, modern fertilization processes and industry are among the most energy-intensive
    and polluting. For every tonne of phosphoric acid manufactured, around 5 tons
    of byproducts are produced [2]. Additionally, nitric acid production is the largest
    source of N2O greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industry [3]. Numerous
    legislative actions are being taken to reduce fertilizer usage, with the European
    Green Deal aiming to reduce it by 20 % by 2030 [4]. Modern image classification
    algorithms can facilitate and automate the determination of fertilization levels
    and optimize fertilizer usage. The first attempts to do so were made in the 90
    s using gray color features for rice nitrogen management [5]. As neural networks
    gained popularity, they were combined with statistical methods to identify crop
    nutrient deficiencies such as iron, zinc, and nitrogen, based on the crop''s size,
    color, and spectral characteristics [6]. Similarly, support vector machines (SVM),
    were used to identify nutritional deficiencies in oilseed rape including magnesium,
    nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium deficiencies [7]. A study was conducted to
    establish a nitrogen identification model for soybean plants by extracting color
    and texture characteristics of soybean leaves using principal component analysis
    and multiple linear regression method [8]. Hyperspectral imaging has recently
    gained attention among researchers as a means of assessing fertilization levels.
    Machine learning techniques, combined with hyperspectral imaging are once again
    the driving force. Visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging, coupled with
    the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, have been used to discriminate nitrogen
    fertilizer levels in tea plants [9]. In addition, various machine learning algorithms,
    including Backpropagation Neural Network, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support
    Vector Machine, have been tested to classify spectra of plants from four different
    levels of Phosphorus fertilization [10]. However, computer vision algorithms intended
    to automate agricultural processes must be explicitly designed for semi-structured
    environments, such as those found in agriculture. Certain elements within fields
    are identifiable in stable environments, but agricultural fields are non-stable
    [11]. Therefore, the complexity of these fields requires the development of complex,
    iteratively fine-tuned machine vision algorithms [12]. Assembling an appropriate
    machine learning system requires harmonizing multiple elements, including feature
    extraction, selection, and classification. This requires a comprehensive understanding
    of mathematics, image analysis, coding, and extensive expertise in selecting model
    architectures [13], [14]. Achieving peak system performance demands a significant
    investment of time in trial-and-error experimentation and a proficient team to
    manually assess a multitude of configurations and models. Furthermore, classifiers
    must undergo iterative retraining due to substantial variations in conditions
    among crops, areas, and regions. Therefore, the ability to automatically generate
    machine learning models specific to a given situation, even for those without
    expertise in the field, would be a valuable accomplishment. Automated Machine
    Learning (AutoML) systems have emerged in recent years as a response to the challenge
    of identifying the most suitable machine learning pipeline for a given task and
    dataset. These systems empower computers to autonomously select the best pipeline,
    potentially offering valuable insights to experienced engineers and leading to
    the deployment of superior models in less time. They can also serve as an educational
    tool for less-experienced users, offering insights into how such models operate,
    the data they require, and their potential applications in addressing common agricultural
    issues. AutoML systems are meta-level machine learning algorithms that leverage
    existing machine learning solutions as building blocks to discover optimal ML
    pipeline structures. These systems automatically evaluate multiple pipeline configurations
    in an iterative process to enhance performance. Currently, two types of AutoML
    solutions are available, cloud solutions, such as Apple''s Create ML, Google Cloud
    AutoML Vision, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and open-source AutoML systems,
    such as Auto-WEKA, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn, TPOT, H2O AutoML, OBOE, autoxgboost
    and PyCaret. The popularity of AutoML systems is increasing, one of the configurations
    tested is the combination of hyperspectral imaging with AutoML systems. This combination
    has already been used to determine the crop yield and biomass [15] and for image-based
    plant phenotyping [16]. However, research in this domain is still limited. Therefore,
    it is necessary to evaluate and compare the capacity of these techniques in additional
    use cases. The primary objective of this research is to investigate whether the
    integration of AutoML techniques can achieve comparable performance to manually-designed
    architectures in classifying the fertilization levels of plants using spectral
    data, and to evaluate the performance of AutoML solutions with the goal of expediting
    and simplifying the implementation of machine learning and computer vision solutions
    in agriculture and hyperspectral imaging. Materials and methods Field experiment
    An experiment on broccoli fertilization was conducted during the winter-spring
    season of 2022 at Agriculture University of Athens, Athens, Greece. The experimental
    species selected was broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. Nerone). Seedlings were
    planted in individual pots, with a total of 90 plants, and grown under glasshouse
    conditions to fully control irrigation and fertilization. A complete NPK fertilizer,
    commonly used in commercial broccoli production, was used to mimic real-life growing
    conditions. Three different fertilization dosages were applied: i) zero fertilization,
    ii) half the recommended dosage, and iii) full dosage. The plants were cultivated
    until they reached BBCH 46–47. All plants that received zero fertilization were
    discarded as they did not reach this stage. Individual plants that received the
    second and third fertilization levels and showed defects such as yellowing or
    flowering were also rejected. The harvested broccoli did not differ in appearance,
    as shown in Fig. 1. The only difference was in the average weight, with the broccoli
    that received the full fertilizer dosage weighing 20 % more on average. Download

    Broccoli with full fertilization dosage on the left and with half fertilization
    dosage on the right. Image/ data acquisition and processing The IMEC Snapscan
    VNIR range (400–900 nm) hyperspectral imaging camera was used to acquire proximal
    hyperspectral images. The camera was mounted on an adjustable but stable arm to
    allow the distance between the camera and the highest point of the sample to be
    kept constant (60 cm) while avoiding any motion blur. Moreover, the camera was
    constantly perpendicular to the broccoli head thus allowing for a top-down view,
    as seen in Fig. 1. Finally, the data acquisition took place in situ at midday
    using natural sunlight as the source of illumination, without any artificial illumination.
    Reflectance calibration was performed for each image using Eq. (1): (1) Where
    Ro: raw hyperspectral image, W: image of a reference object of uniform, stable,
    and high reflectance standard (Spectralon panel 95 % reflectance), D: dark image
    (∼0 % reflectance), Rc: corrected hyperspectral image. Once image acquisition
    and reflectance calibration were completed the background and leaf area were segmented
    in order to extract spectral information only from the broccoli head. Background
    segmentation was executed using the Otsu thresholding algorithm. Based on the
    histogram of pixel intensity values, this algorithm finds an optimal threshold
    value to segment the image into two classes, foreground (broccoli) and background.
    Finally, two versions of the spectral data were produced and fed them to the machine
    learning algorithms: the original extracted data and a second version that was
    smoothed using the Savitzky–Golay filter. A convolution operation is applied to
    the input data using a polynomial window. This filter effectively smooths noisy
    signals while preserving important features. This filter is a smoothing algorithm
    commonly used in signal processing and data analysis [17], the reason for that
    is it diminishes high-frequency signals, such as noise, while simultaneously maintaining
    essential characteristics of the signals, such as relative peaks, troughs, height,
    and width [18] while also being computationally efficient. The second dataset
    was captured using the Lovibond RT300 spectrophotometer and consists of the L*,a*,
    b* values for each broccoli head scanned with the hyperspectral camera. For each
    broccoli head, five points were measured and averaged to achieve a complete representation
    of the sample colour. The reason for acquiring both datasets is that the hyperspectral
    dataset relies on the chlorophyll absorption while the CIELab on the phenomenological
    background of chlorophyll (green colour). Moreover, by combining both types of
    measurements, machine vision systems can achieve more accurate color perception,
    leading to improved object recognition, classification, and quality control. Finally,
    as measurements took place in situ relying on the sun for illumination, the integration
    of spectral and CIELab measurements allows for color consistency and accuracy
    across the varying lighting conditions, leading to more robust models. Machine
    learning experiments Python 3.10 was used to conduct machine learning experiments.
    The performance of the open-source AutoML framework PyCaret [19] was compared
    to that of a manual approach using the scikit-learn 1.3.2 library and the PLS-DA
    algorithm. The SciPy open-source software was used for data preprocessing. All
    experiments, including training and evaluation, were performed on a GeForce 2060
    Max-Q GPU (6 GB of GPU memory). The study used two datasets, hyperspectral and
    CIELAB, each consisted of 49 samples (21 sampes belonged to the half fertilization
    class and 28 to the recommended fertilization class. A 70/30 train test split
    was used resulting in 34 samples/images for training and 15 samples/images used
    for testing. The hyperspectral dataset had 150 features (bands) per sample, while
    each the CIELAB dataset had 3 features (L*, a*, b). AutoML PyCaret is a Python-based,
    low-code machine learning library designed to streamline the experimental process
    for model building and deployment. It offers a wide array of algorithms and automated
    processes for feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and
    model evaluation, covering the entire machine learning workflow. PyCaret offers
    significant advantages for both beginners and experts, providing a range of features
    for quick experimentation and comparative analysis across different models and
    datasets. This allows users to concentrate on model conceptualisation and analysis
    rather than coding intricacies. For the Classification task, PyCaret searched
    for the best machine learning algorithm from a list of 14 algorithms, ranging
    from the simplest ones to the most complex ones. Specifically, Pycaret searched
    through Tree-based models such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting,
    and Decision Tree classifiers, using them independently or in an ensemble to make
    predictions. Linear classifiers, (Logistic Regression and Ridge Classifier with
    L2 regularization). Instance based classifiers (K Neighbours Classifier) classifying
    samples based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors. Hyperplane
    based classifiers (Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel) to separate classes.
    Boosting algorithms (Ada Boost and Light Gradient Boosting Machine) to sequentially
    build weak classifiers to form a robust model. Dimensionality reduction and linear
    discrimination classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant
    Analysis) and the Naive Bayes classifier which utilizes probabilistic methods
    based on Bayes'' theorem with the \"naive\" independence assumption. A StratifiedKFold
    with 10 folds was used to evaluate the models based on accuracy, recall, precision,
    and F1-score. Once the models evaluation metrics were recorded, the AutoML system
    performed automated hyperparameter tuning to search for a better performing solution.

    Fig. 2. AutoML framework pipeline. Machine learning with PLS-DA Partial Least
    Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a multivariate statistical technique
    used to analyze high-dimensional data with the aim of classifying or discriminating
    between groups or categories. PLS-DA is a commonly used machine learning algorithm
    in hyperspectral imaging. It combines the features of PLS regression and a categorical
    variable, allowing for the extraction of latent variables that capture the maximum
    covariance between the predictor and response variables associated with different
    groups. Moreover, PLS-DA is particularly useful when dealing with collinear and
    high-dimensional data, where traditional classification methods may struggle.
    It facilitates dimensionality reduction, aiding in the visualization and discrimination
    of groups while handling multicollinearity issues, making it a valuable tool for
    pattern recognition and classification tasks. A threshold of 0.5 was set for the
    classification task, and StratifiedKFold with 10 folds was employed. Evaluation
    metrics The AutoML and PLSDA systems’ performance was evaluated using Accuracy
    (Eq. (2)), the most common way to evaluate a classification model, which works
    well when the dataset is balanced. (2) However, since our analysis dealt with
    a binary imbalanced problem, it was crucial to compute the micro-averaged F1 score
    (Eq. (3)) for comparative purposes. This study favors this specific aggregation
    technique over the macro-average, especially when dealing with class imbalances,
    as observed in both datasets. (3) Recall measures the proportion of accurately
    identified categories from the original dataset (Eq. (4)), (4) while precision
    gauges the accuracy of labels in the classifier''s output (Eq. (5)) [20] (5) where
    tp = true positives, fp = false positives, tn = true negatives, and fn = false
    negatives More precisely with respect to this study, true positive is the case
    where the model correctly predicts the full fertilization class, while true negative
    is the case where the model correctly predicts the half fertilization class. Respectively,
    false positive is when the model incorrectly identifies the full fertilization
    class as half fertilization, and false negative when the model incorrectly identifies
    the half fertilization as full fertilization. Results In Fig. 3 the extracted
    average spectra (spectral signature) for each class are visualized. Spectral signature
    is a powerful tool for classification as it captures the unique reflectance properties
    of different classes, providing an insight into the classification problem. In
    contrast to Figure 1, differences between the two classes in the red-edge and
    NIR wavelengths are observable. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download

    the CIELAB dataset which achieved an accuracy of 0.72 and F1-score of 0.68. Table

    algorithms. Meanwhile, the MLP algorithm performed the best on the CIELAB dataset,
    followed by the Gaussian Process Classifier, Logistic Regression and SVM - Radial
    Kernel. Finally, the study investigated the synergy between hyperspectral and
    CIELAB color data. The combination of these datasets provided a more holistic
    and detailed understanding of the subject under observation. The results showed
    that the combined dataset outperformed the CIELAB dataset but did not match the
    performance of the hyperspectral dataset. The three algorithms with the best performance
    were Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
    and MLP Classifier. LDA achieved an accuracy of 0.94 and an F1-score of 0.87.

    a machine learning algorithm that is commonly used in hyperspectral imaging applications
    and can serve as a benchmark for comparing AutoML classification performance.

    system for both performance metrics. Τable 3 contains the detailed performance
    evaluation for the PLS-DA. Training using AutoML and a single-feature dataset
    The AutoML system''s performance was evaluated using a single feature dataset,
    building upon the excellent results achieved with the full hyperspectral dataset
    and the AutoML system. To reduce the dataset dimensions, feature selection was
    performed using the scikit-learn library and the ANOVA F-statistic as the score
    function. The possibility of achieving good classification performance with just
    one wavelength was explored by setting the number of desired wavelengths to 1.
    The chosen wavelength was in the near-infrared (NIR) region, specifically at 874
    nm. The AutoML system accurately classified all samples, achieving an accuracy
    and F1-score of 1.00. The top-performing algorithms were the Decision Tree Classifier,
    Ada Boost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, Extra Trees
    Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Extreme Gradient Boosting. These
    classifiers also performed the best when using the full hyperspectral dataset.
    Discussion The study compared the performance of PyCaret, an open-source AutoML
    framework to PLS-DA algorithm, which is a norm for spectra classification, using
    fertilizer level classification as a potential use case. Both approaches performed
    well, with PyCaret showing a slight performance advantage over PLS-DA. This study
    provides evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of modern ML architectures
    for classification tasks. Moreover, the potential of combining CIELAB color space
    with hyperspectral data for fertilizer level classification was tested and compared
    to using only hyperspectral imaging. The results were promising in both cases,
    but slightly lower when using the combined approach. The CIELAB colorspace achieved
    the best classification performance when used alone with PyCaret, with an accuracy
    of 0.72 using a fine-tuned MLP algorithm. When combined with the hyperspectral
    data, the accuracy improved to 0.94 using the LDA algorithm. These results are
    consistent with previous studies that have found a correlation between the CIELAB
    color space and nitrogen status in barley [21], wheat [22], and broccoli [23].
    However, none of these studies report classification metrics, making direct comparisons
    impossible. Instead, they focus on establishing a correlation between the two
    variables. The classification results obtained from the CIELab dataset are inferior
    to those derived from the hyperspectral imaging dataset. The PLS-DA algorithm
    applied to the hyperspectral data produced excellent results with an accuracy
    of 0.91. Combining PLS-DA with hyperspectral data is known to provide excellent
    performance. The technology has been utilized in agriculture for various tasks.
    For instance, it has been used to detect decay lesions in citrus fruit with a
    classification rate of 0.91 [24], identify rice seed cultivars with classification
    rates over 0.8 [25], and predict viability and vigour in muskmelon seeds with
    a classification accuracy of 0.95 [26]. However, the most accurate results were
    achieved by combining the hyperspectral dataset and PyCaret, resulting in an accuracy
    of 1.00, with minimal user intervention required, limited to data preprocessing.
    It is important to note that due to the relatively small sample size, the models
    may be overfitting the data [27], despite the measures taken to prevent this from
    affecting the performance metrics such as using a StratifiedKFold cross validation
    to provide a more representative and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance
    across different folds. Nonetheless, tt is not surprising to achieve perfect classification
    rates when combining Machine Learning and hyperspectral imaging for fertilization
    estimation tasks, as other studies have reported similar results. For instance,
    in tea plants fertilization experiments perfect classification rates (100 % accuracy)
    have been achieved [9], while accuracies of 75 % and 80 % have been reported for
    bok choy and spinach fertilization studies respectively [28]. Moreover, experiments
    on fertilization in corn and cucumbers have reported accuracies of 99.46 % [29]
    and 96.14 % [30] respectively. Although potentially more powerful machine learning
    approaches, such as CNNs were not investigated due to an insufficiently large
    dataset, evidence suggests that they could outperform the PLS [31]. It is important
    to note that combining hyperspectral data with CIELAB data had an adverse effect
    on the classification performance in this particular use case, despite the contrary
    being reported for grape samples [32]. The lack of a strong enough synergistic
    effect may explain why the potential noise introduced by the CIELAB measurements
    could not be overcome. Moreover, the dataset using a single wavelength (874 nm)
    matched the performance of using the whole hyperspectral dataset. This signifies
    that the AutoML system is strong enough to classify samples even when fewer features
    are available. Additionally, the NIR region is the most promising in detecting
    fertilization deficiencies. This explains the poor performance of the CIELAB dataset,
    which captures information in the visible region. The importance of the NIR region
    is also supported by additional research that focused on fertilization [33] Finally,
    the weaker performance of the CIELab dataset compared to the hyperspectral one
    could be attributed to the fact that hyperspectral imaging focuses on chlorophyll
    absorption, which refers to the process by which chlorophyll molecules absorb
    light energy during photosynthesis and it involves the absorption of specific
    wavelengths of light by chlorophyll pigments, which allows them to convert light
    energy into chemical energy. More specifically chlorophyll content is calculated
    using wavelengths 663 and 645 according to the Lambert-Beer law [34]. On the other
    hand, CIELab focuses on the phenomenological background of chlorophyll, which
    refers to the overall influence of various factors, such as the surrounding environment
    and the presence of other pigments. In more detail, the increase in a* has been
    linked exclusively to chlorophyll in the absence of anthocyanin pigments [35].
    Ultimately, these factors can affect the overall absorption spectrum of chlorophyll
    and contribute to the background noise or interference in the measurement of chlorophyll
    absorption. Additionally, CIELab and the phenomenological background of chlorophyll
    (green colour) exhibit a hysteresis effect [36] which can manifest in various
    ways, such as non-linearities in colour transitions or differences in perceived
    colour changes at different points in the colour space. This effect is important
    and can add complexity to image processing applications, thus lowering the model
    performance. All of the aforementioned studies employ complex ML and DL techniques
    that necessitate a thorough comprehension of ML concepts to create and refine
    algorithms. However, this study has achieved comparable outcomes using an AutoML
    framework, PyCaret. AutoML systems, have demonstrated their capabilities in agriculture
    tasks, as shown in studies using AutoML for weed identification [37,38], pest
    identification [39], stress detection [40], and yield prediction [41]. Therefore,
    AutoML holds the potential to replace labor-intensive manual tasks. Conclusions
    The research findings demonstrate that AutoML outperforms PLS-DA. Additionally,
    the results indicate that hyperspectral data outperforms CIELAB data, as well
    as the combination of CIELAB and hyperspectral data. For most computer vision
    tasks, utilizing hyperspectral imaging datasets with PLS-DA is a reliable initial
    approach that yields satisfactory results. However, it requires knowledge of using
    such an algorithm. AutoML is presented as a viable, if not superior alternative
    to manual machine learning methods, catering to both novice and expert users.
    With the increased use of portable multispectral and hyperspectral sensors in
    ground-based and aerial platforms, spectral imaging is becoming more prominent
    in agriculture, providing ample opportunity for the application of AutoML. Moreover,
    as existing and future AutoML solutions integrate more advanced and intricate
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the potential applications will
    expand. Additionally, the simplicity of training these models provides an unprecedented
    opportunity to create bespoke machine learning models that are tailored to specific
    sites and problems, overcoming one of the most persistent challenges in machine
    learning and hyperspectral imaging: model generalization. The study''s results
    provide a foundation for using hyperspectral imaging and AutoMLin Precision Agriculture

    a solution, a regional machine learning aided meta-analysis was performed to assess
    the effects of field management practices, climate conditions, and soil properties
    on crop productivity of no-tillage and deep ploughing versus conventional tillage,
    and to evaluate the probability of yield increase under no-tillage and deep ploughing
    across Northeast China. The results showed that the overall effect of no-tillage

    China 1. Introduction Northeast China is a typical rainfed agriculture region
    at high latitudes with a cool climate, recognized as one of the four major black
    soil areas in the world (Wang et al., 2021). This region is praised as the \"Corn
    Belt\" of China, owing to its nutrient-rich black soils and suitable climate for
    corn cultivation, accounting for approximately 36% of the total corn output in
    China (Lu et al., 2014). Conventional tillage for spring corn in this region involves
    rotary tillage and shallow plowing, with tilling depths typically ranging from
    10 cm to 20 cm and residue removal after harvest. Prolonged conventional tillage
    has resulted in several soil degradation issues, including topsoil structure deterioration
    and severe soil erosion, which hinder the agricultural sustainability (Wen and
    Liang, 2001, Wang et al., 2009). Therefore, it is crucial to embrace sustainable
    agricultural practices such as no-tillage or deep ploughing to restore the natural
    capacity of the soil for support sustainable agricultural (Nugroho et al., 2023).
    However, since crop yield is subject to numerous factors, including management
    practices and local environmental conditions, the effect of no-tillage and deep
    ploughing on corn yield remain variable, and the regions suitable for adopting
    these tillage practices are unspecific, leading to the continued dominance of
    conventional tillage in Northeast China (Wang et al., 2021). No-tillage is a soil
    management strategy that aims to minimize soil disturbance by refraining from
    tilling the soil (Pittelkow et al., 2015). In Northeast China, no-tillage is often
    performed in conjunction with residue retention and crop rotation to improve soil
    quality by conserving soil structure, promoting soil carbon sequestration, increasing
    biodiversity, improving water holding capacity, and reducing water and wind erosion
    (Tian et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2011, Zheng et al., 2022).
    Despite extensive research, the impact and causes of no-tillage on corn yield
    in Northeast China remain unclear. Long-term studies attribute the benefits of
    no-tillage on crop productivity to improved soil nutrients and water content (Zhang
    et al., 2015). In regions with poor soil water holding capacity or a warm-dry
    climate, no-tillage increases corn yield by reducing soil evaporation and enhancing
    soil water availability (Jia et al., 2021, You et al., 2017). Conversely, in cool-humid
    climates, no-tillage delays the corn emergence and shorten the growing period,
    negatively affecting grain yields (Chen et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2015, Lu et
    al., 2015). Some studies have suggested that the negative impact of no-tillage
    on maize yield, primarily from the high straw cover rate which decrease soil temperature
    during the early growing stage, can be mitigated by postponing the sowing date
    or optimizing residue return rate (Chen et al., 2021, Li et al., 2022, Zhang et
    al., 2015). Deep ploughing is a tillage practice that aims to improving soil aeration,
    root penetration, and water infiltration by tilling the soil to a deeper depth
    than conventional tillage, breaking up compacted layers and inverting soil profile
    with a heavy moldboard plow (Schneider et al., 2017). In Northeast China, deep
    ploughing is typically performed after harvest and is frequently combined with
    the deep incorporation of crop residues to the soil profiles deeper than 25 cm,
    which can elevate soil fertility (Meng et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2023). The effect
    of deep ploughing on grain yield varies by site conditions. At sites with compacted
    soil layers hindering root growth, deep ploughing has a more significant benefit
    on grain yield (Schneider et al., 2017). In cool and humid climates, deep ploughing
    achieves greater yields than no-tillage and conventional tillage (Liu et al.,
    2015). Nevertheless, at sites with sandy textured soil or semi-arid climate, overturning
    the soil layer and improving the soil aeration leads an increased soil water loss,
    with deep ploughing showing no corn yield benefit (Dai et al., 2021). Furthermore,
    crop residues and fertilizer management also have pronounced effect on crop productivity
    of deep ploughing, as stated by You et al. (2017). Crop yield is a key factor
    influencing the farmer acceptance of new tillage practices (Wang et al., 2021).
    As described above, the productivity of no-tillage and deep ploughing is influenced
    by many factors, including climatic conditions, soil properties and management
    practices. Most current individual studies in Northeast China focus on the effect
    of management practices on the crop productivity of tillage practices. Recent
    meta-analyses conducted at national or global levels have evaluated the influence
    of climate conditions and soil properties on crop productivity under no-tillage
    and deep ploughing (He et al., 2022, Pittelkow et al., 2015, Schneider et al.,
    2017, Wang et al., 2018, Zhao et al., 2023). However, since crop productivity
    under no-tillage and deep ploughing depends on many interacting factors, it is
    unconvincing to predict crop yield productivity based on the averaged effectiveness
    and single factors. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to clarify the
    effects and relative contributions of these factors on crop productivity under
    no-tillage and deep ploughing in Northeast China. Meta-analysis can provide an
    overall analysis of crop productivity by comparing the results of multiple independent
    studies (Hedges et al., 1999). Machine learning has advantages in exploring the
    intricate relationships between crop productivity and various factors using big
    data and complex algorithms (Pant et al., 2021). The combination of meta-analysis
    and machine learning can help to understand and predict the crop productivity
    of no-tillage and deep ploughing more comprehensively (Kannankai et al., 2022).
    Therefore, we conducted a quantitative analysis of no-tillage and deep ploughing
    studies conducted in Northeast China using machine learning assisted meta-analysis
    with aim of (a) evaluating and comparing the effects of no-tillage and deep ploughing
    on the corn yield relative to conventional tillage in Northeast China, (b) identifying
    the main factors influencing the yield response to no-tillage and deep ploughing
    under different management practices and environmental conditions, and (c) assessing
    and visualizing the regional suitability of no-tillage and deep ploughing. This
    systematic analysis can provide more specific recommendations for farmers to select
    appropriate tillage practices for sustainable agriculture in Northeast China.
    2. Material and method 2.1. Data collection We conducted a search to collect peer-reviewed
    articles published between 2000–01–01 and 2022–12–31 on websites such as Web of
    Science (https://www.webofscience.com/), Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/)
    and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (http://www.cnki.net/) database,
    using keywords including “Northeast China”, “corn”, “maize”, “tillage practice”,
    “no-tillage”, “conservation tillage”, “deep tillage”, “deep ploughing” and “deep
    plowing”. To meet the objectives, we conducted a literature search following PRISMA
    statement to identify studies (Fig. S1). Articles included in the database had
    to fit the following criteria: (1) studies must be conducted on farmland and have
    replication; (2) experimental sites must be within Northeast China, including
    Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces and the east part of Inner Mongolia; (3)
    corn yield results must be reported under conventional tillage practices (shallow
    plowing or rotary tillage to a depth of 0–20 cm and straw removal), and no-tillage
    (no tillage performed from crop harvest to crop establishment) or deep ploughing
    (ploughing to a depth >25 cm and inverting soil profile); (4) straw management
    practices (straw return or straw removal) must be clearly explained; (5) other
    agronomic management practices (irrigation, fertilize application, disease, pest
    management and weed control, etc.) must be consistent among treatments. After
    screening, a total of 130 articles with 514 observed results were included in
    the database, these studies covered 50 experimental sites in Northeast China (Fig.
    1). Download : Download high-res image (360KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. The geographical distribution of the field experiments sites across Northeast
    China includes in the meta-analysis. For each observation collected in this study,
    the mean of crop yield and number of replicates were obtained from tables or extracted
    from figures using GetData Graph Digitizer. The information of management practices
    and environment factors were recorded to analyze the effects of different factors
    on yield changes response to no-tillage and deep ploughing. Data of initial soil
    organic matter (SOM), soil bulk density, and soil pH data were selected from the
    topsoil layer (0–20 cm depth). When key environmental information such as climate
    and soil characteristics were not reported in the studies, we obtained missing
    information from other existing published literature or data sources for the same
    location and comparable experimental years. The extracted analytical data were
    grouped into categories according to the same standard for each property to allow
    comparison amid different studies (Table 1). For the field management factors,
    straw management was divided into removal and application categories, and based
    on the proportion of straw returned or the amount of straw returned, it was averagely
    classified into three levels: low (straw return rate <34%), middle (straw return
    rate between 34% and 67%), and high (straw return rate between 67% and 100%).
    Nitrogen fertilizer application was classified into three levels based on the
    optimal N application rate for maize in Northeast China (Qiu et al., 2015): low
    (<140 kg ha−1), moderate (140–220 kg ha−1), and high (>220 kg ha−1). For climate
    factors, mean annual temperature (MAT) was categorized as cold (<3℃), cool (3–6℃),
    and warm (>6℃) according to the temperature deemed of medium-late maturity spring
    maize varieties (Zhao et al., 2015); mean annual precipitation (MAP) was categorized
    as low (<500 mm yr−1), moderate (500–600 mm yr−1), and high (>600 mm yr−1) according
    to the precipitation deemed of rain-fed maize in Northeast China (Liu et al.,
    2023); and climate region was categorized as arid (aridity index <1) or humid
    (aridity index >1) based on the aridity index (mean annual precipitation divided
    by potential evapotranspiration). According to the relationship between soil organic
    matter (SOM) and crop yields (Oldfield et al., 2019), SOM was categorized into
    three levels based on the organic matter or organic carbon content in the 0–20 cm
    soil layer: high (<1.7%), moderate (1.7–3.4%), and low (>3.4%). Soil pH was categorized
    as acidic (<6.6), neutral (6.6–7.3), or alkaline (>7.3) based on the values of
    soil pH in the 0–20 cm soil layer (Wang et al., 2023). Soil bulk density in the
    0–20 cm soil layer was classified into three categories according to the soil
    productivity assessment of (Mei et al., 2019): low (<1.3 g cm−3), moderate (1.3–1.5 g cm−3),
    and high (>1.5 g cm−3). Table 1. The list of variables in the meta-analysis. Tillage

    randomized effects meta-analysis was performed to determine the grain yield under
    treatment versus conventional tillage. The response ratio (R) was used to compare
    crop yield under no-tillage and deep ploughing versus conventional tillage. We
    used a natural log-transformed response ratio (lnR) as the effect size to calculate
    the effects of no-tillage and conventional tillage on corn grain yield in Northeast
    China. where YT was the mean value of grain yield under no-tillage or deep ploughing.
    YCT was the mean value of grain yield under conventional tillage, respectively
    For each research study, the weighting factor (W) was measured as a function of
    sample size according to the following equation: where NT was the number of replications
    of no-tillage or deep ploughing and conventional tillage, respectively. and NC
    was the number of replications of conventional tillage. The variance (ν) of each
    lnR in each study was measured as the inverse of the pooled variance (1/W). The
    weighted mean effect sizes (lnMR) were calculated as follow: where lnRi and Wi
    are the effect size and weight of the ith comparison, respectively. For easier
    understanding, the relative change of yield (YC, %) was expressed as the percentage
    change, calculated as follows: YC = (e lnMR – 1) × 100% 2.3. Statistical analysis
    METAWIN (Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA, USA) was used to calculate mean
    effect sizes and generate 95% confidence intervals (CI) through bootstrapping
    (5000 iterations) (Shakoor et al., 2021). The effects of tillage practices were
    considered significant compared to conventional tillage if the confidence interval
    does not overlap the zero. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM
    Corp., Armonk, NY., USA) to test the relationships between the yield change and
    agricultural management practices, climate conditions, and initial soil properties.
    The relative importance of agriculture management practices and environmental
    variables was analyzed using a random-forest regression model based on the scikit-learn
    machine-learning packages (ver. 1.2.2) in Python 3.9. 2.4. Model training and
    regional projection To further quantify the suitability of no-tillage and deep
    ploughing in Northeast China croplands, we constructed a classification model
    based on the scikit-learn machine learning packages (ver. 1.2.2) in Python 3.9,
    and used to assess the possibility of yield gain of no-tillage versus conventional
    tillage under current climate conditions and soil properties. The dataset used
    for the model training was generated from the above database. The agricultural
    management practices (straw return rate and N fertilizer rate), climatic conditions
    (MAT, MAP and aridity index), and initial soil properties (soil bulk density,
    pH and SOM) were defined as numerical input variables, and yield change (yield
    gain or yield loss) was designated as a categorical prediction target. When training
    the model, each tree was trained on a random sample of data points, and these
    samples are drawn with replacement using bootstrapping. A 10-fold cross-validation
    approach was used to ensure model stability. The performance of the random forest
    classification model was evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operating
    characteristic curve presented in Fig. S2. Each decision tree in the random forest
    classifies the input sample and gives a yield change trend. The probability of
    yield gain of each sample was derived by voting of each decision tree in the random
    forest classifies. The fitted model was used to estimate the possibility of yield
    gain due to no-tillage and deep ploughing practices for each cropland grid cell
    located in Northeast China using existing climate conditions and soil properties
    data. Field management (180 kg ha−1 N application rate and 100% straw return rate).
    Climate conditions data including MAT, MAP and annual evaporation, were obtained
    from the National Ecosystem Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/). Current
    soil properties data including SOM, pH and bulk density, were obtained from the
    Harmonized World Soil Database V1.2 provided by the FAO (https://www.fao.org/).
    All environmental variables were resampled to a 0.5°×0.5° resolution. The prediction
    result was expressed as the probability of yield gain from no-tillage and deep
    ploughing versus conventional tillage and mapped at a resolution of 0.5°×0.5°.
    3. Results 3.1. Overview of the dataset A total of 350 comparisons (184 for no-tillage
    and 168 for deep ploughing) from 95 studies were included in our dataset. The
    response ratio of crop yield to no-tillage and deep ploughing showed a normal
    distribution based on the Gaussian distribution curve (Fig. 2). The response ratio
    of crop yield to tillage practices showed a large variability among different
    studies in Northeast China, ranging from −0.41–0.64 under no-tillage (Fig. 2a)
    and −0.26–0.34 under deep ploughing (Fig. 2b). The positive effect size on crop
    yield showed a high percentage of observations with 73.3% under no-tillage (Figs.
    2a) and 86.9% under deep ploughing (Fig. 2b). The overall effects of no-tillage
    and deep ploughing significantly increased corn yield by 5.1% (CI: 3.1–7.0%) and
    6.4% (CI: 4.9–7.8%) respectively, compared to conventional tillage (Fig. 2c).

    corn yield under different field management practices The response ratio of crop
    yield under no-tillage and deep ploughing varied with different straw management
    practices (Fig. 3a and b). No-tillage significantly increased corn yield by 4.6%
    (CI: 0.2–8.9%) and 4.9% (CI: 2.6–7.1%) with and without straw return, respectively.
    Deep ploughing significantly increased corn yield by 5.0% (CI: 2.3–7.4%) and 6.8%
    (CI: 5.1–8.5%) with and without straw return, respectively. For the effect of
    straw return rate on crop yield under no-tillage, the highest increase (10.4%,
    CI: 4.8–16.5%) was found in middle straw return rate, and the lowest increase
    was found in the high straw return rate (4.3%, CI: 1.8–7.0%). The highest increase
    under deep ploughing was found in high straw return rate (7.2%, CI: 5.3–9.4%).

    practices by (a) straw management, (b)straw return rates and (c) N application
    rate under no-tillage (NT) and deep ploughing (DP) compared with conventional
    tillage. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. In terms of N application
    rate (Fig. 3c), no-tillage significantly increased corn yield among low N application
    rate (8.8%, CI: 3.1–13.9%), middle N application rate (7.7%, CI: 5.1–9.0%) and
    high N application rate (3.8%, CI: 2.3–5.2%). Deep ploughing significantly increased
    corn yield at middle N application rate (5.5%, CI: 2.9–8.4%) and high N application
    rate (6.1%, CI: 3.8–8.6%), while the deep ploughing had no significant impact
    on corn yield among low N application rate (1.8%, CI: −2.7–6.2%). 3.3. Effect
    of tillage practice on corn yield under different climate factors MAT had a significant
    effect on crop yield under both tillage practices (Fig. 4a). No-tillage significantly
    increased yield over conventional tillage by 9.0% (CI: 6.0–12.0%) and 3.3% (CI:
    0.9–5.9%) when MAT >6°C and 3–6°C, but reduced yield by 3.9% (CI: −9.2–1.84%)
    for MAT < 3°C. Deep ploughing significantly increased yield by 4.2% (CI: 2.7–5.7%),
    7.8% (CI: 5.3–10.4%) and 10.6% (CI: 6.3–14.3%) was observed for MAT >6°C, 3–6°C
    and <3°C, respectively. Furthermore, no-tillage resulted in higher yield increase
    than deep ploughing when MAT >6°C, whereas no-tillage resulted in a lower yield
    increase than deep ploughing when MAT<3°C. Download : Download high-res image

    95% confidence intervals. Fig. 4b showed the response of corn yield to no-tillage
    and deep ploughing in different MAP regions. The yield response to no-tillage
    was observed to be greater in arid regions (9.9%, CI: 6.5–13.3%) and areas with
    MAP<500 mm (9.7%, CI: 6.2–13.6%) compared to humid regions and areas with MAP
    >500 mm. Deep ploughing achieved higher crop yield over conventional tillage in
    humid regions (7.5%, CI: 5.6–9.3%) and areas with MAP>600 mm (15.5%, CI: 10.0–21.9%)
    than in arid regions and areas with MAP <600 mm. In addition, no-tillage showed
    a significantly higher yield increase than deep ploughing in arid regions; however,
    in areas with MAP>600 mm and between 500 and 600 mm, deep ploughing resulted in
    a significantly higher yield increase than no-tillage. 3.4. Effect of tillage
    practice on corn yield under different soil properties No-tillage and deep ploughing
    showed a positive effect on corn yield compared to conventional tillage under
    different SOM (Fig. 5a). No-tillage significantly increased yield over conventional
    tillage by 7.6% (CI: 3.9–11.7%) and 6.0% (CI: 3.7–8.3%) when SOM <1.7% and 1.7–3.4°%,
    but reduced yield by 4.1% (CI: −8.5–0.6%) for SOM >3.4%. Deep ploughing significantly
    increased crop yield from 3.6% (CI: 1.4–5.7%) to 10.2% (CI: 6.4–14.1%) when SOM
    increased from <1.7% to >3.4%. Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download

    ploughing (DP) compared with conventional tillage. Error bars represent 95% confidence
    intervals. Soil bulk density had a significant influence on the crop yield response
    to no-tillage (Fig. 5b). No-tillage significantly increased crop yield over conventional
    tillage by 12.7% (CI: 8.8–17.0%) and 6.2% (95% CI: 3.7–8.8%) at bulk density >1.5 g cm−3
    and 1.3–1.5 g cm−3, but the change (0.7%, CI: −2.0–3.5%) in yield was not significant
    when bulk density <1.3 g cm−3. Deep ploughing significantly increased corn yield
    over conventional tillage at bulk density <1.3 g cm−3 and 1.3–1.5 g cm−3, and
    the increase in corn yield was similar among two bulk density groups. Due to the
    insufficient data, no definitive result was drawn from the subgroup analysis of
    bulk density >1.5 g cm−3. In terms of soil pH (Fig. 5c), no-tillage significantly
    increased crop yield in alkaline soil (9.2%, CI: 6.0–12.8%) and neutral soil (4.3%,
    CI: 2.0–7.0%), but had no significant increase in acid soil (3.3%, CI: −0.5–7.8%).
    Deep ploughing significantly increased corn yield compared to conventional tillage
    among different soil pH, and the increase in corn yield in neutral soil (11.2%,
    CI: 7.7–14.9%) was significantly higher than acid soil (4.2%, CI: 2.3–6.0%) and
    alkaline soil (5.6%, CI: 3.7–7.9%). 3.5. Responses of varieties to tillage practices
    and their relationships with crop yield The results of linear regression (Fig.
    6a) showed that the crop yield response to no-tillage was significantly positively
    correlated with MAT (R2 = 0.1055, p < 0.001), aridity index (R2 = 0.02625, p <
    0.05), soil pH (R2 = 0.03749, p < 0.01) and soil bulk density (R2 = 0.1022, p
    < 0.001), and significantly negatively correlated with soil organic matter (R2
    = 0.03696, p < 0.01). In contrast, the yield response to deep ploughing is significantly
    positively correlated with soil organic matter (R2 = 0.1011, p < 0.0001), and
    significantly negatively correlated with nitrogen application rate (R2 = 0.05188,
    p < 0.01) and MAT (R2 = 0.0923, p < 0.0001). Download : Download high-res image

    included N application rate, straw return rate, mean annual precipitation (MAP),
    mean annual temperature (MAT), Initial soil organic matter (SOC), pH, and bulk
    density (BD). 3.6. Relative importance of variables on yield change response to
    no-tillage and deep ploughing A random forest regression model was conducted to
    investigate the relative importance of agricultural management practices, climate
    condition and soil properties (Fig. 6). The model showed that the most important
    predictor of yield change response to no-tillage was MAT (21.0), followed by aridity
    index, SOM, MAP, and soil pH accounting for 17.4%, 12.7%, 12.1% and 12.0%, respectively.
    Management practices (44.2%), especially N application rate (27.1%), had the most
    important influence on the yield change from deep ploughing. In contrast, climate
    conditions and soil properties explained only 38.1% and 17.7% of the variation
    in crop yield from deep ploughing, respectively. 3.7. Probability of yield increase
    with no-tillage and deep ploughing in different area The analysis results of the
    models showed that under no-tillage and deep ploughing practices, the overall
    probabilities of yield increase stand at 65.9% and 86.9% respectively. Geographical
    variations of these probabilities within Northeast China region were evident from
    the maps generated (Fig. 7). Specifically, the probability of yield increase under
    no-tillage was higher in regions with relatively lower latitudes (<46°) compared
    to higher latitudes. In regions above 48°, the probability of yield increase was
    more likely to be below 50%, indicating a higher probability of yield loss. In
    terms of regional variations, no-tillage performed better in the Liaohe Plain
    and the south of Songnen Plain than Sanjiang Plain and north of Songnen Plain.
    For deep ploughing, the probability of yield increase showed a decreasing trend
    from east to west. More specifically, the probability of yield increase was relatively
    higher in the Liaohe Plain, Sanjiang Plain and northern Songnen Plain compared
    to the southern region of the Songnen Plain and the Inner Mongolia. Download :

    possibility of yield decrease. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of no-tillage on yield
    improvement depends on environment conditions No-tillage, particularly when combined
    with straw retention, is commonly recognized for its capability to improve soil
    fertility, promote water conservation, prevent soil erosion, and reduce labor
    and fuel costs in Northeast China (Sui et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2011). Our
    study demonstrated that no-tillage had a positive effect on corn yield compared
    to conventional tillage in Northeast China, except in areas with cold climate
    (Fig. 4) and high SOM content (Fig. 5). In high-latitude regions, heat resources
    are the primary constraint for corn production (Hetta et al., 2012), and our study
    also indicated the MAT had the highest relative importance. No-tillage minimizes
    soil disturbance, which reduces soil surface evaporation and increase soil water
    content. Residue cover reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the soil
    surface and prevents heat exchange between air and soil surface (Irmak and Kukal,
    2022). The combination of increased soil heat capacity and reduced soil heat flux
    reduction led to reduced soil temperature in spring, resulting in delays in corn
    sowing and emergence (Azooz et al., 1997). In cold areas where heat resources
    during the growth period just meet the needs of corn growth, delays in corn sowing
    and emergence result in a shortened growing period, and ultimately a high probability
    of yield loss due to insufficient dry matter accumulation and reduced harvest
    index. In contrast, corn growth is not limited in warm regions since corn can
    obtain sufficient accumulated temperature even with delayed sowing. However, the
    role of no-tillage in reducing soil evaporation is advantageous for water supply,
    especially in areas without sufficient precipitation (López-Fando et al., 2007).
    Additionally, we found that the aridity index was more important to yield productivity
    than MAP, suggesting that considering precipitation and evaporation together can
    provide a more comprehensive assessment of no-tillage productivity, especially
    in Northeast China region where rainfed agriculture dominates. Although soil properties
    and management practices had less importance than the climate conditions, they
    still exerted an influence the productivity of no-tillage. Generally, corn yields
    increase with increased SOM when other management practices are optimized (Oldfield
    et al., 2019). The role of no-tillage in increasing SOM is considered another
    key benefit that improves yield production (Omara et al., 2019). However, the
    benefits of no-tillage on organic carbon sequestration did not provide further
    increase in grain yield in areas where the initial SOM levels were beyond optimum,
    and even showed yield reduction because those areas were mainly located in cold
    and humid regions of Northeast China. Some studies have reported that no-tillage
    have drawbacks on soil health, for example, the decomposition of straw releases
    organic acids that may exacerbate soil acidification (Paul et al., 2001). This
    statement is also supported by our results that no-tillage had no significant
    improve on crop yields in acidic soils (Fig. 5c). However, in alkaline soils where
    organic acids may aid in buffing soil alkalinity (Jiang et al., 2018), no-tillage
    significantly increased crop yields. Soil compaction was identified as a problem
    of no-tillage, which limits root development of plants (Blanco-Canqui and Ruis,
    2018). In this study, the tendency for no-tillage to be more effective on soil
    with high initial bulk density may be related to precompression stress, which
    represents the soil resistance to compaction (Horn and Fleige, 2003). The precompression
    stress of arable soils is positive correlated with bulk density (An et al., 2015),
    and the negative effect of no-tillage on soil compaction in soils with high initial
    bulk density may be less significant. Moreover, the slow straw decomposition rate
    in cold regions limits the benefits of straw return. Straw management practices,
    such as optimizing the quantity and cover rate of crop straw, can increase straw
    utilization and improve radiation transmission through the residue cover, mitigating
    the decrease in soil temperature caused by no-tillage (Azooz et al., 1997). Therefore,
    selecting sites with suitable initial soil properties and optimizing the straw
    return rate could be potential strategies for alleviating the adverse effects
    of no-tillage on corn yield in Northeast China. 4.2. Effect of deep ploughing
    on yield improvement depends on field management practices High soil strength
    often hinders root growth and water infiltration, hampering plant access to needed
    subsoil nutrients and water (Bengough et al., 2011). Deep ploughing tills deeper
    than conventional tillage and inverts the soil profile, breaking up compacted
    soil layers and decreasing the bulk density (Burger et al., 2023). This process
    can alleviate root-restricting soil layers and enhance water infiltration capability
    (You et al., 2017), but burying the topsoil into deep layer decreases nutrient
    content of topsoil in short term. Thus, employing moderate fertilization is crucial
    to addressing the negative effect of deep ploughing on nutrient availability in
    the topsoil (Zhang et al., 2022). Straw incorporation carried out in conjunction
    with deep ploughing is a valuable soil management practice that facilitates soil
    organic carbon sequestration and improves soil productivity (Kaur and Arora, 2019).
    Our research revealed that returning straw to the soil resulted in higher crop
    yield increases compared to removing straw when using deep ploughing, particularly
    with a high rate of straw return. Deep ploughing buried residues in deep soil
    layer of 20–40 cm, which mitigated the inhibition of large amounts straw return
    on sowing and emergence. Additionally, deep ploughing improved the mixing of straw
    with soil, accelerated the decomposition of crop residues, and promoted the utilization
    of nutrients contained in the straw (Alcántara et al., 2016). Therefore, nitrogen
    fertilizer management and straw return practice should be prioritized in deep
    ploughing system. Moderate nitrogen application and adequate straw return were
    essential for increasing corn productivity of deep ploughing in Northeast China.
    Deep ploughing has a complex interplay with local environmental conditions, with
    its effects being more pronounced under certain climatic and soil conditions (Schneider
    et al., 2017). The results of this study showed that the benefit of deep ploughing
    on grain yield was significant higher in cold region than in warm region. This
    can be attributed to the fact that, in comparison with conventional tillage, deep
    ploughing loosens and aerates soil structure, resulting in an increased porosity
    and decreased bulk density, which consequently elevates soil temperature during
    the early growth stage of corn (Lipiec et al., 2006, Jiang et al., 2020). Deep
    ploughing is effective at enhancing crops'' drought resilience by promoting the
    absorption of subsoil water (Schneider et al., 2017). Our results showed that
    deep ploughing achieved higher crop yield in humid regions than arid region (Fig.
    4). This can be explained by the fact that deep ploughing promotes rainwater infiltration,
    but it also promotes the loss of soil moisture (Schwartz et al., 2010). In humid
    region, the corn season typically experiences sufficient precipitation, and the
    implementation of deep ploughing reduces the risk of waterlogging while improving
    water storage in subsoil (Wang et al., 2014). However, in semi-arid regions where
    the potential evapotranspiration exceeds annual precipitation, deep ploughing
    may lead to net soil water loss (Wang et al., 2020). Regarding soil properties,
    deep ploughing is more effective in increasing yields on soils with high levels
    of SOM and neutral pH (Fig. 5). High SOM soils typically exhibit elevated nutrient
    content, while neutral soils often possess more balanced nutrient release than
    acidic or alkaline soils (Feng et al., 2019, Hatten and Liles, 2019, Wang et al.,
    2023). Deep ploughing is more effective at improving nutrient availability on
    high SOM and neutral soils, thereby achieving higher yield increments (Yan et
    al., 2023). Hence, the selection of deep ploughing as an agronomic practice to
    enhance crop yield and economic returns necessitates the consideration of local
    environmental conditions. 4.3. Probability of yield improvement under no-tillage
    and deep ploughing in Northeast China The identification of geographical variations
    and distributions of regions suitability for transitioning from conventional tillage
    to no-tillage or deep ploughing systems is essential for selecting appropriate
    tillage practices. Based on field experimental dataset and the random forest model,
    we quantified and mapped the probability of yield increase with no-tillage and
    deep ploughing under current environmental conditions in Northeast China. More
    importantly, by combining the meta-analysis results, we were able to discern the
    reasons behind a region''s suitability or unsuitability for implementing of no-tillage
    and deep ploughing, considering climate conditions and soil properties. MAT demonstrated
    the highest relative significance among environmental factors in two tillage practices.
    The correlation between MAT and grain productivity in no-tillage and deep ploughing
    is primarily attributed to the influence of these farming techniques on soil temperature
    (Chen et al., 2021). Specifically, no-tillage practice leads to a decrease in
    soil temperature, causing a declining trend in the probability of yield increase
    from south to north. In contrast, deep ploughing can increase soil temperature,
    leading to a slight north-south increase in the probability of yield. No-tillage
    and deep ploughing employ different approaches to improve soil moisture for increased
    crop yield. No-tillage reduces evaporation, thereby increasing available water
    (Zhang et al., 2015), while deep ploughing improves soil moisture by promoting
    water infiltration (Zhao et al., 2023). Consequently, no-tillage was more effective
    in increasing crop yield in arid regions with low precipitation and high evapotranspiration,
    such as the Southern Songnen Plain, Western Liaohe Plain, and Inner Mongolia.
    Conversely, deep ploughing was more effective in areas with higher precipitation
    such as the Sanjiang Plain, Liaohe Plain. Soil properties, although less significant
    than climate conditions, appear to influence the regional suitability of two tillage
    practices. As previously discussed, no-tillage tends to exhibit a higher yield
    increases under poor soil quality. This can be attributed to the ability of no-tillage
    to enhance soil biodiversity, buffer soil alkalinity, and improve organic matter
    (Wang et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2022). Thus, the performance of no-tillage was
    expected to be highest in the western Liaohe Plain, where alkaline soil with high
    bulk density and low SOM are prevalent. In contrast to no-tillage, deep ploughing
    enhances crop yields by facilitating plant utilization of soil nutrients and water
    (Meng et al., 2016, Yan et al., 2023). Hence, deep ploughing is expected to be
    more efficient in the mollisol region in the northern Songnen Plain and Sanjiang
    Plain where soil have a better nutrient availability. In contrast, in the southern
    Songnen and Inner Mongolia Plains, where soil quality is poor, deep ploughing
    showed comparatively lesser effect on yield enhancement. No-tillage and deep ploughing
    represents two distinct methods of soil management. Owing to their divergent principles
    and different responses to natural environmental conditions, there exist substantial
    geographical variations in the suitable areas for these two practices. Our study
    aids agricultural extension services and farmers in identifying and evaluating
    tillage practices that are appropriate for their local climate and soil conditions
    as an alternative to conventional tillage practice. Furthermore, our study furnishes
    agricultural researchers with meaningful information to focus research efforts
    in areas where yield declines are prevalent, and to improve field management practices
    to reap from the benefit of conservation tillage while avoiding reductions in
    grain yields and profits. However, there were also limitations in our study. The
    quality and quantity of data have great impact on the reliability of meta-analysis
    results and random forest estimators. Although the cross-validation results of
    the classification model in this study are satisfactory overall (Fig. S2), incorporating
    a larger dataset could enhance the random forest model''s ability to learn the
    data''s features and patterns more precisely. In addition, this study only considers
    the probability of yield increase as evaluation criterion of regional suitability,
    which may not fully account for the impact on economic and ecological benefits.
    Therefore, a more comprehensive model can be established to predict the effects
    of no-tillage and deep ploughing on grain yield when additional data becomes available
    for future analysis. Concurrently, evaluating the performance of no-tillage and
    deep ploughing in terms of economic and ecological benefits can provide more reliable
    guidance for farmers and agricultural managers to make more informed decisions.
    5. Conclusion In this study, we evaluated the effect of no-tillage and deep ploughing
    on corn yield in Northeast China, and quantified the relative importance of climate
    conditions, management practices, and initial soil properties for crop yield response
    to two tillage practices. Our results demonstrated that climate conditions showed
    a high importance for crop yield response to no-tillage. No-tillage is recommended
    as a replacement for conventional tillage in the warm and arid region of southwest
    Northeast China. In contrast, field management practices showed a high importance
    to crop yield response to deep ploughing. Moderate N application and adequate
    straw return were essential for increasing corn productivity of deep ploughing.
    Deep ploughing achieved higher corn yields in regions with low annual temperature
    and high annual precipitation, and neutral soil with high SOM. Thus, it is advisable
    to use deep ploughing instead of no-tillage in the north of Northeast China. Based
    on the predict results of the random forest model in this study, agricultural
    managers can identify the tillage practices that have exhibited potential for
    increasing crop yield in specific regions of Northeast China. Moreover, it is
    essential to evaluate the economic benefits and environmental impacts associated
    with different tillage practices. By striking a balance between crop yield, economic
    benefits and ecological sustainability, it is possible to achieve higher crop
    yields while ensuring the long-term health and productivity of agricultural ecosystems.

  description: Weeds are a major threat to crop production. Automated innovations
    for reducing herbicides and labor needed for weeding have become a high priority
    for sustainable weed management. The current state-of-the-art weeding systems
    still cannot reliably recognize weeds in changing field conditions for precision
    weed control. Enhancing weed recognition accentuates the critical need to develop
    dedicated, labeled weed databases and whereby train advanced AI (artificial intelligence)
    models while ensuring the robustness of models across diverse field conditions.
    This study presents an up-to-date survey on publicly available image datasets
    for weed recognition. Among 36 datasets identified, limitations exist in terms
    of data variations and distribution shifts, and few of the datasets are suitable
    for examining the robustness of weed recognition models. A new two-season, eight-class
    weed dataset is described in this study, comprising two sub-datasets of images
    collected in the seasons of 2021 and 2022, respectively. Three state-of-the-art
    deep learning object detectors, i.e., YOLOX, YOLOv8, and DINO, were benchmarked
    and evaluated for their in-season and cross-season weed detection performance
    on the dataset. All three models attained in-season detection accuracies of 92%
    and higher in terms of mAP@50. However substantial accuracy drops of up to 14.5%
    were observed between in-season and cross-season testing, especially for YOLOX
    and YOLOv8. Unsupervised domain adaptation based on an implicit instance-invariant
    network (I3Net) was utilized for improved generalization of the YOLO models. The
    I3Net-based models resulted in accuracy improvements of 1.4% and 3.3% for YOLOX
    and YOLOv8, respectively, compared to modeling without domain adaptation, in the
    cross-season testing. Both the two-season detection dataset1 and software programs2
    for weed detection modeling in this study are made publicly available.

    detection 1. Introduction Weeds have a detrimental impact on crop growth and yield,
    presenting a significant threat to global food security. Among various biotic
    stressors, weeds are responsible for an average of 34% of crop yield losses worldwide
    (Oerke, 2006). Left uncontrolled, they have the potential to lead to complete
    yield loss (Chauhan, 2020). In the United States, the annual economic loss in
    crop production due to weeds is estimated to be greater than $30 billion (Pimentel
    et al., 2000). Since the introduction of trans-genetic, herbicide-resistance crops
    in the 1990s, weed management has heavily relied on applying herbicides for many
    field crops (Duke, 2015). Over-reliance on herbicides, however, facilitates the
    selection of adaptive weed populations and thus the evolution of resistance to
    herbicides (Délye et al., 2013), substantially increasing management costs. At
    the time of writing, 530 unique cases (species × site of action) of herbicide-resistant
    weeds of 272 species have been reported globally (Heap, 2024). With few herbicides
    pending release and no new herbicide sites of action introduced for over 30 years
    (Heap and Duke, 2018), there is an overwhelming need to develop herbicide-reduced
    or non-chemical weed control tools for sustainable crop production. A recent survey
    of weed scientists in North America revealed the high research priority of precision
    weed management and robotics (Brainard et al., 2023). In recent years, machine
    vision technologies have grown rapidly and achieved remarkable progress, offering
    promising solutions for precise weed control. Different vision-guided weed control
    techniques have been developed (Allmendinger et al., 2022, Machleb et al., 2020,
    Merfield, 2023), and some of them have been commercially available, e.g., laser
    weeding from Carbon Robotics (Seattle, WA) and See & Spray™ from John Deere (Moline,
    IL). As artificial intelligence (AI) impacts agriculture, deep learning (DL) techniques,
    especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are ushering in a new paradigm
    in model development for weed detection and discrimination from crops (Coleman
    et al., 2022, Lati et al., 2021). Significant research has been conducted on the
    application of various CNN architectures for weed recognition in the past few
    years for different cropping systems (Chen et al., 2022; Dang et al., 2023; Gao
    et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2019), as recently reviewed in Coleman
    et al. (2022) and Rai et al. (2023a). Despite remarkable progress, challenges
    persist in reliably and accurately recognizing weeds in changing field conditions
    by state-of-the-art automated weeding systems with AI models deployed. The erratic
    performance of commercial weeding systems could occur in fields with dense weed
    populations (Raja et al., 2019), or when systems were deployed in unseen field
    conditions according to our personal observations of some latest robotic weeders,
    which may lead to significant crop damage in intra-row weeding (Lati et al., 2016).
    The lack of robustness in weed recognition remains a key barrier to practical
    deployment and wide-scale adoption of automated weeding systems. Weed recognition
    challenges are fundamentally due to the significant biological variabilities of
    weed plants and the presence of many weed species important to crop production.
    The morphology of weeds varies temporally across different growth stages and seasons
    and spatially in different field locations. These variations are convoluted with
    changing field conditions, including lighting, soil types and fertility, and many
    other uncontrolled factors, adding difficulty to robust weed recognition. To tackle
    these challenges requires, in addition to pursuing model architecture innovations,
    creating large-scale, labeled image weed datasets consisting of images acquired
    in diverse yet relevant field conditions, especially considering recent successes
    of big data-powered AI models, e.g., ChatGPT (chat generative pre-trained transformer)
    and SAM (segment anything model), in machine learning and computer vision communities.
    In surveying public image datasets in precision agriculture, Lu and Sierra (2020)
    identified 15 weed datasets released from 2015 to 2020. Most of these datasets
    are comparably small in terms of the number of weed images and species. Coleman
    et al. (2022) presented an updated list of weed datasets and identified 15 dataset
    sources, most of which were released before 2022. Despite the updated survey,
    some weed datasets were not included, and the image acquisition and curation processes
    important to machine vision applications were not described in adequate detail.
    To address the shortage of labeled data, semi-supervised learning methods have
    been investigated to train models using a small amount of labeled data while leveraging
    more unlabeled samples (Yang et al., 2022). Khan et al. (2021) built a semi-supervised
    generative adversarial network (SGAN) for crop and weed classification, acquiring
    90% accuracy with over 80% of training images unlabeled, where synthetic images
    were generated by a modified SGAN to optimize the training process. More studies
    on GAN-based methods for enhanced weed recognition are reviewed by Lu et al. (2022).
    Derived from DeepLabV3, SemiWeedNet (Nong et al., 2022) used both labeled and
    unlabeled images to train a weed segmentation model, and online hard example mining
    was deployed to concentrate the model on hard-classified pixels, achieving competitive
    accuracy comparable to that based on fully labeled data. In recognizing weeds
    in wheat, Liu et al. (2023) proposed a semi-supervised learning method based on
    consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling while incorporating an attention
    mechanism, achieving 87.7% testing accuracy when 95% of training samples were
    unlabeled, compared with the accuracy of 92.2% by supervised learning. Generally,
    despite data labeling efficiency, semi-supervised learning methods produce lower
    accuracies than their supervised counterparts. Data distribution shifts are commonly
    encountered in deploying machine learning systems, manifested as degraded model
    performance (Koh et al., 2021). This is conceivably true for weed recognition
    models when applied to different field conditions that induce distribution shifts
    or domain gaps. Models trained on weed data acquired in controlled environments
    are not likely to generalize well to datasets collected in natural field conditions,
    and it can also be challenging for weed recognition models to generalize across
    different growth stages, seasons, and geographical locations. Many existing weed
    datasets were captured in a particular imaging session or domain (e.g., a specific
    location and time for limited weed species), which fail to represent a broad array
    of distributions in diverse field conditions and are not suitable for evaluating
    the cross-domain robustness of weed recognition models. This probably explains
    the scarcity of research on model generalization for weed identification (Rai
    et al., 2023b). In recent years, there has been growing interest in improving
    the generalization of AI models to achieve real-world deployment success. Various
    domain adaptation techniques, which involve leveraging labeled source domain data
    and unlabeled target domain data for model development, have been proposed for
    enhanced performance in visual recognition tasks (Liu et al., 2023; Oza et al.,
    2023). Domain adaptive object detection aims to develop a robust detection model
    by using label-rich data of the source domain while utilizing the information
    from label-agnostic or -scarce target domain. Among different adaptation formulations
    (Oza et al., 2023), unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which assumes no annotations
    are available for the target domain, is more practically useful yet technically
    challenging. Various UDA approaches have been reported. Domain randomization (Tobin
    et al., 2017) diversifies the source-domain contexts to mitigate its domain bias.
    The adversarial domain discriminator (Chen et al., 2018) aims to differentiate
    the source and target domain. The image-to-image translation transfers the target-domain
    images into a new domain with a source-like appearance (Rodriguez and Mikolajczyk,
    2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Self-training techniques use the target-domain predictions
    as pseudo labels to learn the target-domain information (RoyChowdhury et al.,
    2019). As reviewed in Oza et al. (2023), multiple studies (D''Innocente et al.,
    2020; Kim et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Munir et al., 2021; Rodriguez and Mikolajczyk,
    2019; Zhao et al., 2020) utilized the pseudo-label-based self-training in cross-domain
    object detection, combining labeled source-domain images with unlabeled target-domain
    images. There are typically three levels of feature alignment (at class, image,
    and instance levels) for utilizing target-domain information. However, many previous
    studies considered just one or two of these alignments. I3Net (implicit instance-invariant
    network) (Chen et al., 2021) offers a unification of all three-level feature alignments
    and can be potentially useful for adapting object detectors to improve the generalization
    performance of weed detection. The objective of this study was three-fold, i.e.,
    to: 1) present an up-to-date survey of publicly available weed datasets, 2) curate
    a new two-season, eight-class weed dataset for cross-season weed detection, and
    3) evaluate and improve the generalization performance of state-of-the-art DL
    object detectors for cross-season weed detection. Specifically, in weed detection
    experiments, YOLOX (Ge et al., 2021), YOLOv8 (Jocher et al., 2023), and DINO (Zhang
    et al., 2022) were assessed on the new two-season dataset, and I3Net was leveraged
    to adapt the two YOLO detectors for potentially improved cross-season weed detection.
    2. Public weed dataset survey Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic
    search in major databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science,
    IEEE Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed database”,
    “agriculture”, “machine vision” and “computer vision”. Particularly, to facilitate
    searching via Google Scholar, the Python library “scholarly”3 was employed to
    automatically retrieve publication records. A total of 451 records were collected
    from the literature search, including 267 articles from Google Scholar, 54 from
    ScienceDirect, 12 from Web of Science, 106 articles from IEEE Xplore, and 12 articles
    from arXiv. The initial records were subjected to filtering based on the exclusion
    criteria, including duplication removal, elimination of review articles, and eligibility
    verification. Datasets reported in the literature but with the associated website
    links invalid or broken were also excluded. Table 1 lists the weed image datasets
    identified. Table 1. Major public weed image datasets for weed/weed-crop recognition.

    imaging, hyperspectral imaging, and unmanned aerial vehicle, respectively. A total
    of 36 public weed image datasets have been identified at the time of writing.
    Given space constraints, a complete list and detailed descriptions of weed datasets
    are given at https://github.com/vicdxxx/Weed-Datasets-Survey-2023, which will
    be dynamically updated over time. The majority of the identified datasets were
    captured using RGB (red-green-blue) or color cameras, while some datasets were
    captured using other imaging sensors (e.g., depth, multispectral, and hyperspectral)
    or a multimodal approach. Presented below is a brief overview of the datasets
    which are loosely categorized into different groups based on weed classes. 2.1.
    Multi-weed-class datasets The Sugar Beets dataset (Chebrolu et al., 2017) is among
    the first large multi-class weed datasets, which consists of 9 weed species captured
    by a ground robot (with artificial lighting) on a sugar beet field in Germany.
    Multimodal data are included in the dataset, including RGB, NIR (near-infrared),
    depth (all three types of images were taken from Kinect-v2) images acquired by
    cameras, point clouds of the plants by laser scanners, and robot-related data
    (e.g., wheel odometry). The data collection was conducted for two to three days
    per week over about two months, covering varied crop growth stages (Chebrolu et
    al., 2017), leading to collected data of approximately 5 TB. The image data consists
    of two types of pixel-level annotations, including 283 instance annotations of
    plant species (i.e., sugar beet and 9 weed species) and 12,340 instance annotations
    of contextual objects (i.e., crop, weeds, and soil background). The Leaf Counting
    dataset (Teimouri et al., 2018) consists of RGB or color images labeled in terms
    of the leaf number of weeds (reflecting plant growth stages), covering 18 weed
    classes (i.e., weed species or families) in fields across Denmark during three
    growing seasons. Weeds with 1 leaf to 9 leaves were captured by several hand-held
    cameras, providing images focusing on an individual plant in each. A total of
    9,372 images were annotated at image level annotations for weed species and leaf
    number. The Open Plant Phenotype Database (Madsen et al., 2020) consists of 7,590
    color images for 47 plant species (including crops and weeds) common in Denmark.
    The plants were grown under three different conditions for a period from seedling
    emergence to the stages of 6–8 leaves. Images were captured and collected over
    three consecutive years by cameras fixed with a top-down view on a railing system
    under supplemental lighting. Bounding box annotations were provided for different
    plant species in the dataset, resulting in 64,292 plant instances. Beck et al.,
    2021 released a dataset consisting of 14,000 color images for 14 species including
    crops and weeds common in North America. Images were taken from varied view angles
    (i.e., profile shots, top-down shots, and angled perspectives), with each image
    focusing on a single potted plant with a uniform background. Alongside raw image
    data is the metadata (e.g., camera, date, and capture time) included in the dataset.
    Despite the seemingly large scale of the dataset, only potted plants were captured
    under controlled indoor settings, restricting the applicability of this dataset
    in real-world field scenes. The AIWeeds dataset (Du et al., 2022) consists of
    10,140 color images of the flax and weeds in flax fields taken in different locations.
    The images were captured under varied sunlight and weather conditions and for
    different plant growth stages, but details on platform configuration and imaging
    devices were not provided. The dataset4 was annotated at the image level, and
    among 14 non-crop classes, the images with non-target plant species or backgrounds
    were labeled as negative samples. The Weed25 dataset (Wang et al., 2022) consists
    of 14,035 color images of 25 weed species in East Asia. Most images were acquired
    under natural, open field conditions at varied growth stages from two to nine
    leaves, with a small proportion of the weeds cultivated in the pots under controlled
    conditions of the greenhouse. Images were taken at a close distance (30–50 cm)
    from the target with each image for one single weed plant. On average, 561 images
    were annotated for each weed species, coupled with 19,208 bounding box annotations
    in total. The CropAndWeed dataset (Steininger et al., 2023) consists of 8,034
    plant images captured in diverse Austria field locations for a total of 74 crop
    and weed species in early growth stages. Images were captured from a top-down
    view at a height of about 1 m in different environmental conditions (in terms
    of lighting, weather conditions, and soil types) over a four-year period. Image
    annotations were performed at different levels including bounding boxes, semantic
    masks, and stem positions, resulting in about 112 K instances. An extensive set
    of image metadata about the environmental conditions and camera parameter settings
    was provided. The CottonWeedID15 dataset (Chen et al., 2022) contains 5,187 color
    images of 15 weed classes, which were captured with hand-held cameras in cotton
    fields in the southern U.S. during two consecutive seasons. The image annotations
    were done at the image level with each image containing a single class of weeds.
    Derived from the CottonWeedID15, the CottonWeedDet3 dataset (Rahman et al., 2022)
    was created for weed detection, which consists of a subset of 848 images for 3
    weed species with 1,532 bounding box annotations. Acquired in cotton fields across
    Mississippi, the CottonWeedDet12 (Lu et al., 2022) is a larger weed detection
    dataset comprising 5,648 images of 12 weed classes with 9,370 bounding boxes.
    Alongside the release of all three weed datasets was a benchmark of a suite of
    deep learning models for weed recognition (Chen et al., 2022; Dang et al., 2023;
    Rahman et al., 2022). In addition to weed images, different crops were also captured
    in some datasets (Gaidel et al., 2023; Madsen et al., 2020; Mylonas et al., 2022;
    Steininger et al., 2023; Sudars et al., 2020). Sudars et al. (2020) presented
    a dataset consisting of 1,118 RGB images for 6 crops and 8 weed species, with
    7,853 bounding box annotations (441 annotations for crops and 7,442 for weeds).
    Images were captured with digital cameras in both controlled environments and
    field conditions. The Eden Library (Mylonas et al., 2022) consisted of 6,428 images
    captured by proximal sensing platforms and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in
    field conditions, for 15 crops and 9 weed species by a handful of imaging devices.
    Emphasizing on-field image diversity, the database covered different crop health
    conditions involving 30 disorders, which can be beneficial for model robustness.
    Metadata was included in the database regarding plant species, imaging hardware
    specifications and data formats, and a dedicated web application (https://edenlibrary.ai/eden-library/)
    was created for hosting the data and facilitating data reuse, which is dynamically
    updated. The structured data curation practices with detailed documentation in
    this study (Mylonas et al., 2022) would be a good reference for the development
    of large-scale weed databases. Depth and hyperspectral imagers were also employed
    for weed imagery. Xu et al. (2022) presented a dataset for two weed species in
    wheat fields captured using both RGB and RGB-D (depth) cameras. The subset of
    RGB-D data consisted of three types of images, including RGB, single-channel depth,
    and three-channel encoded images (for phase, height above ground, and angle with
    gravity), with 1,288 images for each, according to 21,227 bounding box annotations.
    Another subset of data consisted of 619 RGB images captured at varied view angles
    with 11,095 bounding box annotations, coupled with 79 depth images in the vertical
    view. Kitzler et al. (2023) introduced a dataset captured using two RGB cameras
    in a stereovision setup mounted at a working height of 90 cm on a trolley. Image
    collection was started right after plant emergence and until plants reached a
    height of 30 cm. The resulting dataset consisted of 2568 semantic maps annotated
    by drawing polygons, with 18 classes, including 7 crops and 10 weed species plus
    soil background, and it also included the metadata for weather conditions, geolocation,
    and camera parameters. A total of 4,038 annotated instances for 7 crop species
    and 7,506 instances for 8 weed species were annotated in the dataset. In Gaidel
    et al. (2023), a hyperspectral image dataset was acquired for 13 classes of crops
    and 3 classes of weeds with a line-scanning imager, which contained 385 hyperspectral
    images with 237 bands in the wavelength range of 420–979 nm, stored as NumPy arrays.
    There are pixel-wise annotations for each instance of plants. 2.2. Uni-weed-class
    datasets The uni-weed-class datasets are those that do not differentiate weed
    species or collectively label weeds as a single class. These datasets can be useful
    for weed control tactics that target all weeds in the same way but not for high-precision
    weed-species-specific treatments. Generally, for mechanical weeding, it is adequate
    to only differentiate between crops and weeds regardless of plant species, but
    higher-precision weeding requires knowledge of weed species. Several early public
    weed datasets fall in this category, such as the CWFI dataset (Haug and Ostermann,
    2015), Carrot-Weed (Lameski et al., 2017), WeedNet (Sa et al., 2017), Sugar Beet
    Synthetic dataset (Di Cicco et al., 2017), and WeedMap (Sa et al., 2018). Recently,
    the sunflower dataset in Fawakherji et al. (2021) consisted of 500 four-channel
    RGB-NIR images captured at varied crop growth stages, with three-class pixel-wise
    annotations for crop, weed, and soil background. The Lincoln beet dataset (Salazar-Gomez
    et al., 2022) contained 4,402 RGB images of weeds and beets captured from three
    different sugar beet fields (Lincoln, UK), with 39,246 bounding box annotations
    including 16,399 and 22,847 annotations for beets and weeds, respectively. The
    PhenoBench dataset (Weyler et al., 2023) consisted of 2,872 RGB images captured
    in sugar beet fields during two consecutive growth seasons, in which 2,179 images
    were pixel-wise annotated at both plant-instance (i.e., crops and weeds) and leaf-instance
    precision levels, particularly with 4,021 and 6,739 annotated instances for plants
    and leaves, respectively. One step further in the fine-grained dataset curation
    is to categorize weeds into broadleaf and grass or other collective groups that
    demand different weeding tactics, helping optimize weed control (Jin et al., 2022).
    For instance, ACCase-inhibiting herbicides provide selective control over grassy
    weeds, while auxin herbicides are commonly used for controlling broadleaf weeds
    in grass crops (Grossmann, 2010). Example weed datasets following this approach
    include the soybean crop-weed images (dos Santos Ferreira et al., 2017), the join-stem
    detection dataset (Lottes et al., 2018), the MMDWWF dataset (Xu et al., 2022),
    and the RoboWeedMap dataset (Teimouri et al., 2022). For instance, the RoboWeedMap
    consisted of 1,147 RGB images captured from over 200 different fields in Denmark,
    with 19,221 and 41,810 annotations for monocot and dicot weeds, respectively.
    2.3. Other weed datasets To save data collection and annotation efforts, image
    synthesis has received increasing attention in recent years. The aforementioned
    Sugar Beet Synthetic dataset (Di Cicco et al., 2017) synthesized 8878 color images,
    with pixel-wise annotations of three classes including crop, weed, and soil. Procedural
    generation of computer graphics was utilized by randomly parameterizing the crops
    and weeds (e.g., the number of leaves, leaf layers, and relative distribution
    of the plants) and the surroundings (e.g., soil and light conditions) in the target
    sugar beet field. A leaf kinematic model was utilized, combined with physically
    based shading techniques, for generating leaves of target plants, and real-world
    color textures coupled with auxiliary image maps (e.g., ambient occlusion and
    height), of weeds and crops were deployed. Some published weed datasets contain
    a significant portion of unlabeled data. The aforementioned CropAndWeed dataset
    (Steininger et al., 2023) contained a total of 43,814 plant images, but only 8,034
    images were labeled. Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images from a
    variety of maize farmlands for the maize crops and associated weeds. Despite the
    dataset scale, only 500 images were annotated with 5,764 bounding box instances.
    3. Materials and methods 3.1. Dataset curation The dataset in this study comprised
    weed images captured in two consecutive seasons of 2021 and 2022. The images captured
    in 2021 were sampled from the CottonWeedDet12 dataset (Lu, 2023), while the set
    of images in 2022 was first introduced in the study. Images in both seasons were
    collected for naturally germinated weeds with hand-held color cameras under natural
    field conditions in different field sites on research farms at Mississippi State
    University (Dang et al., 2023). The acquired images were labeled with bounding
    boxes by trained personnel using the VGG Image Annotator (v2.10) (Dutta and Zisserman,
    2019). As done in Dang et al. (2023), the weed instances were labeled by their
    common names rather than scientific names, and the annotations, exported in .JSON
    file format, were subjected to quality check before inclusion in the dataset.
    As a result, a total of 2,717 images collected in 2022 were labeled with 3,959

    plus the “TBD” category for unknown weeds that remain to be determined. To conduct
    cross-season weed detection experiments, the images captured in both 2021 and
    2022 were used to build a new two-season dataset. Eight abundant weed classes
    (i.e., Waterhemp, Carpetweed, Morninglory, Goosegrass, Spotted Spurge, Palmer
    Amaranth, Purslane, and Ragweed) were identified, each of which contained >100
    annotation instances for each year. The Year 2021 data, derived from the CottoWeedDet12
    dataset (Lu, 2023), contains 4,734 images with 7,664 annotations for the eight
    weed classes, as opposed to 1,930 images with 3,184 annotations for the Year 2022
    data. As such, a new two-season, eight-class weed dataset was created, consisting
    of 6,664 images with 10,848 bounding boxes, including 7,664 bounding boxes for
    Year 2021 and 3,184 bounding boxes for Year 2022. The datast was made publicly
    available (Lu, 2024). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of images and bounding box

    models in-season and cross-season weed detection Three object detectors, including
    YOLOX (Ge et al., 2021), YOLOv8 (Jocher et al., 2023), and DINO (Zhang et al.,
    2022), were selected to evaluate the performance of both in-season and cross-season
    detection. YOLOX is a milestone of the one-stage YOLO (You Only Look Once) series,
    which is presumably the first YOLO model to leverage an anchor-free mechanism
    (Tian et al., 2019). Utilizing Darknet-53 (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) as its backbone,
    YOLOX extracts three-level features, which are then fused and fed into their innovative
    decoupled head. These improvements not only expedite its converging speed in the
    training process but also elevate the detection performance. As the new frontier
    for object detection, YOLOv8 (Jocher et al., 2023), released in January of 2023,
    boasts technical features including anchor-free detection mechanisms, efficient
    convolutional layers, the utilization of feature pyramid networks for recognizing
    objects of varying sizes, and advanced data augmentation as well as a user-friendly
    API. Although not formally presented in a peer-reviewed publication, YOLOv8 has
    gained popularity rapidly and has become a top choice for real-time object detection.
    Different from CCN-based object detectors like YOLOs, DINO (Zhang et al., 2022)
    is a transformer-based detector, which evolves from the earlier DETR (DEtection
    TRansformer) model (Carion et al., 2020), with improved performance through contrastive
    de-noising training, mixed query selection for anchor utilization, and a look
    forward twice scheme for box prediction. DINO and its variants have attained state-of-the-art
    object detection accuracy on the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014). Specifically,
    YOLOX-large (with 43.6 M parameters) and YOLOv8-large (with 54.2 M parameters),
    pretrained on the COCO (Lin et al., 2014), and DINO-SwinL-scale4 (with 217.2 M
    parameters) pretrained on the Object365 (Shao et al., 2019), were chosen for weed
    detection experiments in this study, which were adapted from their open-source
    repositories5. Fig. 3 shows the experiment pipeline for in-season and cross-season
    weed detection. In-season modeling refers to the process where the model is trained
    and tested on the data from the same growth season, while cross-season modeling
    is for training and testing on the data collected from the different seasons.
    In either scenario, the corresponding weed dataset was randomly split into train,
    validation, and test sets according to a ratio of 75%: 5%: 20%. To balance the
    cross-season model capability, the training set from the Year 2021 data was subsampled
    in a stratified manner across weed classes to have the same image number as the
    Year 2022 data, leaving the validation and test sets unchanged, and all the images
    of the Year 2022 data were utilized in our experiments. Download : Download high-res

    weed detection. The three weed detectors were fine-tuned with their default hyperparameter
    settings, with the major settings summarized in Table 2. These settings vary with
    models, which may not be optimal for weed detection here. For instance, In YOLOX,
    the BCE (binary cross entropy) and IoU losses were used for classification and
    regression tasks, respectively. YOLOv8 implemented the DFL (distribution focal
    loss) (Li et al., 2020) along with CIoU (Complete IoU) (Zheng et al., 2021) for
    bounding box regression, and VFL (varifocal loss) (Zhang et al., 2021) for its
    classification task. For DINO, L1 loss and GIoU (Generalized IoU) (Rezatofighi
    et al., 2019) were used for box regression, with the focal loss (Lin et al., 2017)
    for classification. No external image augmentation was performed in this study,
    given the fact that all three detectors have embedded data augmentations. YOLOX
    and YOLOv8 implement color jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements
    random crop and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly
    with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 800 ×
    800 pixels, which is compatible with model architectures and training efficiency.
    The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of each image to 800 and adding
    padding to the short side to maintain the original image aspect ratio. All models
    were trained for 40 epochs with batch size 8, which could adequately converge
    based on empirical observations. Table 2. Primary hyperparameter settings of the

    and confidence thresholds are not applicable for DINO. The weed detection accuracy
    was quantified in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) with an IoU (Intersection
    over Union) threshold of 0.5, i.e., mAP@50. As in our prior work (Chen et al.,
    2022; Dang et al., 2023), Monte-Carlo cross-validation (Raschka, 2018), with three
    replications, was implemented to obtain a robust estimate of model performance.
    In each replication, the corresponding dataset was partitioned into training,
    validation, and testing sets with a different random seed, and the performance
    metrics on the test set over three replications were averaged for eventual model
    assessment. The weed detection modeling was conducted in the framework of PyTorch
    (version 1.13.1) with Torchvision (version 0.14.1), OpenCV (version 4.7.0), and
    CUDNN (version 9.2) on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. 3.3. Unsupervised domain adaptation
    (UDA) Given potential dataset shifts across seasons, UDA-based models were built
    for improved cross-season performance. As a UDA approach, I3Net (Chen et al.,
    2021) was utilized here to adapt weed detection models for improved generalization.
    It learns domain-invariant features through three main architectural modules,
    i.e., category-aware object pattern matching (COPM), dynamic and class-balanced
    reweighting (DCBR), and regularized joint category alignment (RJCA), as shown
    in Fig. 4. COPM boosts the cross-domain foreground objects matching guided by
    categorical information and suppresses uninformative background features. DCBR
    reweights target samples based on the adaptation difficulty with respect to the
    intra-domain and intra-class variations. RJCA aligns categories at various high-level
    layers between source and target domains with regularizations for feature consistency.
    More details of I3Net are given in Chen et al. (2021). Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Domain adaptation framework
    I3Net used in this study. COPM, DCBR, and RJCA denote the modules of category-aware
    object pattern matching, dynamic and class-balanced reweighting, and regularized
    joint category alignment, respectively, in Chen et al. (2021). The original I3Net
    (Chen et al., 2021) uses the SSD (single shot multibox detector) (Liu et al.,
    2016) as the base detection model. In this study, the I3Net was integrated with
    YOLOX and YOLOv8 for improving their cross-season weed detection performance.
    For YOLOv8, which consists of 22 nodes (primary modules include multiple layers)
    in the network architecture6from the initial input node 0 to the final prediction
    node 21, different nodes were selected for I3Net integration. Specifically, the
    features from YOLOv8 node 4 and a backbone layer were fed into the pixel-level
    domain discriminator Dl of COPM, the features from the node 15 were used in DCBR,
    and the nodes 18 and 21 were fed into the RJCA for cross-domain assignment. Similar
    integration involving four nodes was done for YOLOX, except that different layers
    of YOLOX were interfaced with the three modules of I3Net. The output of the YOLOX
    backbone feature 0 was fed into the domain discriminator Dl of COPM, the head
    feature 0 into DCBR, and the head features 1 and 2 were connected to RJCA. These
    connecting nodes in YOLOv8 and YOLOX correspond to the low-level, middle-level,
    and high-level features of different modules of I3Net. Unlike training the YOLO
    models without domain adaptation, a different learning rate scheme was implemented
    to train the I3Net modules. Considering the embedded noise in unpaired target
    domain images may adversely affect early-stage training, the initial learning
    rate was set to 0.001 for training the I3Net modules, which aimed to ensure the
    effective learning of source-domain information, being less disturbed by the target
    domain images, and thereafter the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance
    feature adaptation to the target domain. Other hyperparameter settings remained
    as described in Table 2. 4. Results 4.1. In-season and cross-season weed detection
    Fig. 5 shows the weed detection accuracies without performing domain adaptation.
    For the in-season detection models, high accuracies were obtained with mAP@50
    ranging from 92.0% to 98.7%, with the best accuracy obtained by DINO, and YOLOX
    and YOLOv8 achieved comparable accuracies. The three detectors performed consistently
    better on the Year 2022 data than on the Year 2021 data, which may be explained
    by the higher diversity observed in the Year 2021 data, requiring higher learning
    capability of models. The exact reason for differing performance in the two sub-datasets
    remains to be ascertained by analyzing the characteristics of the two-season dataset
    to reveal those influencing the detection. In cross-season modeling, substantial
    accuracy drops were observed for all three models trained on the 2022 data and
    tested on the 2021 data, in comparison with in-season models for the 2022 data,
    and the drops were 14.5%, 14.2%, and 8.8% for YOLOX, YOLOv8, and DINO, respectively.
    On the other hand, the models trained on the Year 2021 data generalized better
    to the Year 2022 data, except that an accuracy drop of 3.2% was observed for YOLOv8
    compared to the corresponding in-season modeling. Overall, these results suggest
    that the YOLOv8 and YOLOX models had weaker cross-season generalization ability
    than the DINO model. The latter achieved improvements ranging from 3.8% to 8.4%
    in cross-season weed detection compared to the two YOLO models. The improved performance
    agrees with the fact that the transformer-based DINO model has about four times
    the learnable parameters compared to the YOLO models, implying higher model complexity
    and better learning compacity for the intended task. Fig. 6 shows differing predictions

    the detection confidence and the predicted weed class, respectively. 4.2. I3Net-based
    weed detection Fig. 7 compares the weed detection performance of YOLO models with
    and without I3Net-based domain adaptation. The I3Net-based models achieved higher
    accuracies in all cross-season scenarios, and also higher or comparable accuracies
    in in-season tests. Particularly for cross-season modeling, the I3Net-based YOLOX
    (trained on the Year 2021 data and tested on the Year 2022 data), improved the
    detection by 1.1% mAP@50 (from 92.0% to 93.1%) compared to the original YOLOX
    without I3Net, and an improvement of 1.4% mAP@50 (from 82.9% to 84.3%) was attained
    for the model trained on the Year 2022 and tested on the Year 2021 data. The YOLOv8
    with I3Net resulted in an improvement of 3% mAP@50 (from 88.9% to 91.9%) in the
    cross-season detection when trained on the Year 2021 and tested on the Year 2022
    data, and on the other hand, it yielded an improvement of 3.3% mAP@50 (from 81.5%
    to 84.8%) while trained on the Year 2022 and tested on the Year 2021 data. For
    both I3Net-based YOLOX and YOLOv8, which were trained on the Year 2022 data and
    tested on the data from the same and different seasons, there were still performance
    gaps >10% mAP@50. Nonetheless, the cross-season performance improvements ranging
    from 1.1% to 3.3% mAP@50, relative to the corresponding accuracies obtained without
    domain adaptation, were found statistically significant (over three replications)
    according to a paired-sample t-test at a significance level α = 0.05. These results
    demonstrated the efficacy of I3Net-based domain adaptation for improving cross-season
    generalization of YOLO models. Download : Download high-res image (354KB) Download

    available weed datasets are valuable resources for weed recognition research.
    However, a few limitations or gaps need to be identified based on the weed dataset
    survey presented in this study. As pointed out by Lu and Sierra (2020), despite
    the recent efforts in weed image database development, none of the published weed
    datasets are comparable to those impactful datasets in computer vision such as
    ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), COCO (Lin et al., 2014), and Open Images (Kuznetsova
    et al., 2020), in terms of image or instance numbers, highlighting the dire need
    of continued data curation efforts. Imagery data that capture the biological variability
    of weeds/crops and field condition variations are crucial for developing robust
    weed recognition models. Although many weed datasets contained images collected
    in varying conditions, few datasets are dedicated to capturing the plant and field
    factors (e.g., growth stages and seasons, soil conditions) in a systematic manner,
    and in this regard their applicability to tackle domain shift problems in weed
    recognition is still limited. Following the weed dataset survey, this study presents
    a new two-season multi-class weed dataset, which has been made publicly available
    (Lu, 2024), and an evaluation of cross-season weed detection performance. The
    new two-season weed dataset in the study represents an initial step for constructing
    a testbed to clearly reflect the across-season domain shift issues that have been
    less investigated in the literature on weed detection. Addressing the issues is
    necessary for developing robust weed recognition models across seasons and, furthermore,
    for creating practically useful weeding systems. For this purpose, three representative
    detection models were experimented on the two-season dataset, demonstrating the
    generalization issues due to the domain shift, especially for the two YOLO models,
    although the present dataset is still limited in the number of images, bounding
    boxes, and weed classes, as well as seasons. A more large-scale, diverse multi-season
    dataset is needed for extensive evaluation of cross-season model robustness. In
    addition to season factors, practically useful models are also expected to be
    robust to many other important temporal and spatial factors such as plant growth
    stages, soil types, field locations, etc., which demand dedicated data curation
    efforts in future research. Experimented on the two-season dataset, the I3Net-based
    domain adaptation approach positively impacted the cross-season generalization
    of YOLO models, but there is room for further reducing performance drops and achieving
    higher accuracies comparable to that of in-season modeling in some scenarios (Fig.
    7). Although coarse-to-fine feature adaption (Zheng et al., 2020) is a widely
    acknowledged paradigm for cross-domain object detection, there has been a lack
    of dedicated research to introduce hierarchy feature adaptation techniques into
    the context of cross-season weed detection, leaving a largely unexplored area
    for improvements. The I3Net-based domain adaptation technique experimented in
    this study represents a promising starting point for exploring coarse-to-fine
    feature adaptation approaches, opening new opportunities in the field. In addition
    to cross-season performance drops in weed detection in this study, performance
    drops of up to 45% accuracy were observed in a recent study on cross-domain crop-weed
    segmentation (Weyler et al., 2023). The performance gaps were reduced to around
    10% by introducing unlabeled plant images from additional agricultural fields
    (beyond the source and target domains) to diversify source-domain images and enhance
    the training process associated with the approximate annotations generated by
    heuristic methods (e.g., color indices and crop row arrangement). Many potential
    methods are available to address data shift issues in cross-domain modeling tasks,
    particularly advanced multimodal generative models, such as stable diffusion (Rombach
    et al., 2022), and DALL·E 3 (https://openai.com/dall-e-3), among other generative
    modeling techniques (Lu et al., 2022). These models can generate realistic high-resolution/-fidely
    images that can be used to diversify the source datasets and enhance target-domain
    data. Furthermore, specific light conditions and accurately assigned object locations
    (Zhang et al., 2023) can be achieved to provide precise control over image synthesis,
    offering potential means for boosting cross-domain detection. Future research
    into the quantitative assessment of domain gaps or shifts between training and
    testing data can be beneficial for developing effective methods for improved cross-domain
    performance and deciding on whether domain adaptation/generalization is needed
    on unseen data (Doan et al., 2023). The current evaluation metrics (Kynkäänniemi
    et al., 2019) focus on image fidelity and reality, which contribute to the assessment
    of image generation by rapidly growing diffusion models instead of evaluating
    the domain gaps. On the other hand, the human evaluation protocol, which is widely
    adopted to distinguish synthetic images, like side-by-side image comparison (Wang
    et al., 2023), can be a useful strategy to measure the domain gaps before more
    solid domain-gap metrics are discovered. 6. Conclusion This study surveyed publicly
    available weed datasets directed at machine vision-based weed management, identifying
    36 datasets captured for different weeds and crops in varied imaging conditions.
    These datasets are valuable resources for weed recognition research. However,
    few datasets are large-scale in comparison to those open datasets widely used
    in the computer vision community because of unique challenges in weed dataset
    curation. More dedicated efforts are needed to create large-scale weed datasets
    while capturing important domain variations, spatially and temporally, so as to
    enable the development of robust weed recognition models. In this regard, a new
    two-season, eight-class dataset captured in natural field conditions was presented
    in this study, consisting of 4,734 images with 7,664 bounding box annotations
    and 1,930 images with 3,184 bounding boxes, captured in two consective seasons
    of season of 2021 and 2022, respectively. Three object detectors (YOLOX-large,
    YOLOv8-large, and DINO-SwinL-scale4) were evaluated on the dataset for both in-season
    and cross-season weed detection. The cross-season accuracy in terms of mAP@50
    was found to drop substantially by up to 14.5% compared to that in the corresponding
    in-season detection, implying cross-season data domain shifts. The DINO compared
    favorably to the two YOLO detectors in cross-season generalization performance.
    A UDA approach based on I3Net was employed to adapt the two YOLO detectors to
    reduce performance drops across seasons. The I3Net-based YOLOX and YOLOv8 models
    attained improvements of up to 1.4% and 3.3% mAP@50 compared to their counterparters
    without I3Net, which were statistically significant. Extensive research has yet
    to be done to develop more effective approaches to mitigate the cross-season performance
    drops. In addition to pursuing algorithmic innovations in domain adaptation/generalization,
    having larger sets of representative imagery will be beneficial and examined in
    our future work. CRediT authorship contribution statement Boyang Deng: Writing

    Since the 21th century, the global population has experienced rapid growth. Despite
    efforts in the agriculture sector to keep up with the demand of food, the pace
    of population growth has outstripped agricultural production (Ahmed et al., 2024).
    Consequently, this imbalance has resulted in an uneven distribution of essential
    nutrients such as protein, fat and calories in the diet consumed by the people
    (Pradhan et al., 2019). According to United Nation’s estimates, there are over
    900 million malnourished people worldwide with one fourth of them being children
    under the age group of four or five. These young children are particularly vulnerable
    to the adverse effects of severe protein and energy malnutrition (PEM). The primary
    cause of inadequate access to nutritious remains a significant factor contributing
    to under-nutrition, especially among children in many developing countries (UN,
    2010). Over the past few decades, fish has emerged as a significant protein source
    in many developing countries (Ahmed and Ahmad, 2020, FAO, 2020, Ahmad et al.,
    2021. Ahmad et al., 2021, Ahmad et al., 2021a, Ahmad et al., 2021b; Ahmad et al.,
    2022). The nutritional value of fish is unquestionable as it is rich in high-quality
    protein, essential micronutrients and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids. Notably,
    fish exhibits more pronounced satiating effects compared to terrestrial animal
    proteins like beef and chicken meat (Uhe et al., 1992). Around 60 % of people
    in developing countries heavily depend on fish for at least 30 % of their animal
    protein intake, while nearly 80 % of the population in most developed countries
    obtain less than 20 % of the animal protein from fish (FAO, 2022). However, some
    Asian countries show a relatively higher reliance on fish (Delgado, 2003). Despite
    fish plays a crucial role in sustaining a significant segment of the global population,
    with a major portion of the diet consisting of fish and fishery related products
    (Minar et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2015, Gandotra et al., 2017). It’s availability
    is being compromised by unsustainable fishing practices in natural water bodies.
    This management is contributing to a deficiency in providing nutritionally adequate
    food for the populations of developing countries. Worldwide total catch of fisheries
    production in 2016 was around 91 million tons, involving about 79 million tons
    from marine waters and only 12 million tons from inland waters (FAO, 2018). By
    2030, an extra quantity or quantum of 37 million tons of fish for each year will
    be needed to meet the demand of current degrees of fish utilization for an extended
    world population. As capture fisheries is showing the indications of nearly stagnation
    for last one decade, there is a dire need to tap extra sources of resources that
    can be achieved through the mobilization of water bodies. Aquaculture emerges
    as a viable solution to this challenge, offering the potential to significantly
    augment overall fish production (Allan, 2004, Khursheed et al., 2023). To address
    the growing disparity between demand and supply on a global scale, advanced aquaculture
    technologies represent the sole viable recourse. Although different traditional
    techniques have already been employed in aquaculture, but recent technological
    advancements promise to reduce human intervention and enhance aquaculture productivity.
    Notably, AI stands out as a transformative force in the aquaculture industry (Mustapha
    et al., 2021). AI technologies are actively employed in monitoring and managing
    fish health and growth, leading to improved feed, diminished risk of disease outbreaks,
    and enhanced overall farm productivity. Geetha and Bhanu (2018) reported that
    the involvement of developmental algorithms and models in AI, enabling that conventially
    necessitate human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning and problem-solving.
    In the realm of aquaculture, AI facilitates the analysis of data derived from
    sensors and cameras to monitor fish behaviour, detect signs of disease or stress,
    employ automatic sensors for measuring fish length and weight, and optimize feeding
    regimes (Barreto et al., 2022, Føre et al., 2018, Tonachella et al., 2022). By
    analyzing this data using AI algorithms, researchers can develop predictive models
    that can identify the early signs of disease or stress in fish (Gladju et al.,
    2022). Sharma and Kumar (2021) emphasize the role of integrated sensors, biosensors,
    and AI in minimizing the reliance on antibiotics and other medications. Furthermore,
    AI contributes to the formulation of personalized feeding programs tailored to
    meet the nutritional requirements of individual fish, optimizing growth rates
    and fostering improved overall health and well-being (Kaur et al., 2021). It can
    also help to improve the management of fish reproduction, by developing predictive
    models that can identify the optimal conditions for spawning and egg production
    (Chapman et al., 2014, Migaud et al., 2013). This review comprehensively synthesis
    the application of AI to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture
    industry, particularly in the domains of fish reproduction, feeding, and growth.
    A compilation of prior studies on AI applications is presented in Table 1, Table

    yields Overview of Artificial intelligence (AI) AI refers to the simulation or
    approximation of human intelligence in machines. The aim of AI includes computer-enhanced
    learning, reasoning and perception (Xu et al., 2021). In recent years, AI has
    grown an importance in aquaculture research and production, with both start-ups
    and established corporations developing new AI-based applications for the industry
    (The Lutz Report, 2023). Data mining and machine learning are two closely related
    techniques that are commonly used in the field of AI to analyze large amounts
    of data and extract useful insights and knowledge. While they share some similarities,
    there are also few differences between the two techniques (Sarker, 2022). Data
    mining refers to the process of extracting patterns and relationships from large
    datasets. It involves using a variety of statistical and computational techniques
    to identify trends, associations, and anomalies in the data. Data mining techniques
    can be used to explore the data, identify patterns and relationships, and develop
    predictive models that can be used to make decisions based on the data (Wu et
    al., 2021). Machine learning, on the other hand is a subfield of AI that involves
    the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions
    or decisions based on that learning (Sarker, 2021). Machine learning algorithms
    are designed to identify patterns and relationships in data, and then use those
    patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data (Choudhury et al., 2021).
    There are several different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (Mahesh, 2020). Supervised
    learning algorithms are trained on labelled data, where the correct answers are
    known, and are used to make predictions or decisions about new data learning (Mahesh,
    2020). Unsupervised learning algorithms, on the other hand, are trained on unlabelled
    data, where the correct answers are not known, and are used to identify patterns
    and relationships in the data (Patel, 2019). Reinforcement learning algorithms
    are used to train agents to take actions in an environment in order to maximize
    a reward. Both data mining and machine learning techniques are widely used in
    a variety of industries and applications, including finance, healthcare, marketing,
    and more (Sarker, 2021). They are particularly useful in fields where large amounts
    of data are available, and where there is a need to extract insights and knowledge
    from that data in order to make informed decisions. An overview of some studies
    related to AI in aquaculture is presented in Table 1. Considering the revolutionary
    of AI and machine learning, present review has been designed to summarize the
    role, importance and future perspectives of AI in aquaculture. Types of AI AI
    refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
    to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception,
    reasoning, learning, and decision-making (Xu et al., 2021). AI is a broad field
    that encompasses various subfields and applications, and there are several types
    of AI (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (229KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its types. Based on functionalities,
    types of AI are as below; Reactive AI: This type of AI is programmed to react
    to specific situations or inputs but cannot learn from past experiences or make
    predictions about the future (Sarker., 2022). Limited Memory AI: This type of
    AI can learn from past experiences and make decisions based on that knowledge,
    but it has limited memory and cannot consider a large amount of data (Xu et al.,
    2021). Theory of Mind AI: This type of AI can understand the beliefs, emotions,
    and intentions of other agents, making it useful for applications such as social
    robotics. Self-Aware AI: This type of AI has a sense of self and can understand
    its own capabilities and limitations. Based on Capabilities following are types
    of AI; Narrow AI: Weak AI, commonly referred to as narrow AI, is limited to performing
    a single narrow task. It advances along the spectrum of a single subset of cognitive
    talents. As machine learning and deep learning techniques advance, specialised
    AI applications are appearing more frequently in our daily lives (Sarker., 2022).
    General AI: General AI, also known as strong AI, is capable of understanding and
    learning any intellectual task that a human being is capable of. It enables a
    machine to apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts. So far, AI researchers
    have not been able to achieve strong AI. They have to figure out how to make machines
    conscious, programming a full set of cognitive abilities. Super AI: Outperforms
    human intelligence and is capable of performing any task better than a human.
    Artificial super intelligence envisions AI evolving to be so similar to human
    sentiments and experiences that it not only understands them, but also elicits
    emotions, needs, beliefs, and desires of its own. Its existence is still speculative.
    Thinking, solving puzzles, making judgements, and making decisions on its own
    are some of the critical characteristics of super AI (Xu et al., 2021; Sarker,
    2022). Potential applications of artificial intelligence in aquaculture Aquaculture
    stands as a rapidly expanding industry that demands significant technological
    advancements to improve farming practises. To enhance productivity, the development
    of novel farming methods is imperative and AI emerges as a key in many ways. Nowadays,
    AI gadgets are accessible to provide a more stable environment for the stock.
    Although there are several applications of AI in aquaculture, but here we discuss
    few of them in detail as below: 1. Use of AI in monitoring water quality. Effective
    water quality monitoring is paramount for the success of aquaculture operations
    (Lindholm-Lehto, 2023), given the multifaceted factors influencing it. Some of
    them are necessary to keep water at least as sustainable as possible. Fish activity
    can be directly impacted by the water quality due to the fish’s high reliance
    on the aquatic environment. Monitoring water quality is therefore a crucial problem
    to take into account, particularly in the fish farming industry (Arafat et al.,
    2020) and AI is increasingly being used to help in this area (Lu et al., 2022).
    This section aims to elucidate how AI can be effectively employed in monitoring
    water quality within aquaculture systems. By analyzing data from sensors that
    measure parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and ammonia levels
    (Dupont et al., 2018), AI algorithms can detect patterns and anomalies that may
    indicate problems with the water quality (Zhao et al., 2021, Khurshid et al.,
    2022). This can help farmers to take corrective actions before any harm is done
    to the fish. AI-powered water quality monitoring systems can continuously monitor
    multiple parameters in real-time, which can provide more accurate and timely information
    than manual monitoring methods (Javaid et al., 2022). This allows farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes in water quality, reducing the risk of fish mortality and
    other negative outcomes. AI assumes a pivotal role in developing predictive models
    that anticipate changes in water quality before they occur. It can be helpful
    in analyzing the historical data on water quality and other factors such as weather
    patterns and feeding schedules (Saeed et al., 2022). Besides, AI algorithms can
    predict the likelihood of changes in water quality and provide early warnings
    to farmers. Gunda et al. (2018) have developed an AI-based mobile application
    platform for water quality monitoring for bacterial contamination, where they
    have used a low-cost rapid test kit i.e., Mobile water kit for detecting the water
    quality for bacterial contamination. Moreover, AI algorithms can help farmers
    to optimize water quality parameters based on the specific needs of the fish species
    being farmed (Chiu et al., 2022). Aldhyani et al. (2020) developed advanced AI
    algorithms to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification
    (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear
    autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep
    learning algorithm have been developed. In addition to this, three machine learning
    algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) and
    Naive Bayes have been used for the WQC forecasting. Their results revealed that
    the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality
    according to superior robustness. Moreover, temperature is a critical factor in
    aquaculture, as it directly affects the health and growth of aquatic organisms
    (Mugwanya et al., 2022). AI algorithms can analyze data from temperature sensors
    in fish farms to monitor water temperature continuously. By this technique, the
    system can identify patterns and anomalies in the temperature data and provide
    real-time alerts to farmers if the temperature deviates from the optimal range
    for the specific fish species being farmed (Yang et al., 2021). This will allow
    farmers to detect changes in temperature quickly and take appropriate actions
    to maintain optimal conditions for the health and growth of the fish (Mustafa
    et al., 2016, Joseph et al., 2019, Chiu et al., 2022). By continuously monitoring
    the temperature, AI algorithms can also provide valuable insights to farmers on
    the impact of environmental changes on the fish and help to prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature (Føre et al., 2018). Besides
    this, AI algorithms can identify trends and patterns in the data, which can indicate
    potential risks to the health and growth of the fish (Manoj et al., 2022). This
    might be explained that when temperature increases rapidly, it may indicate a
    problem with the cooling system, which could lead to higher mortality rates for
    the fish (FAO, 2018). AI algorithms can also analyze data from other environmental
    factors such as water quality, feed management and weather patterns to provide
    a holistic view of the fish farm''s conditions (Lafont et al., 2019). By integrating
    this data, AI algorithms can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights
    to farmers on how different environmental factors can impact the health and growth
    of the fish (Niloofar et al., 2021). This can help farmers make more informed
    decisions on how to optimize their fish farm operations and prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature or other environmental factors
    (Gladju et al., 2022). Considering the findings of these studies, it can be inferred
    that AI algorithms can provide valuable insights to fish farmers. 2. Use of AI
    in disease detection and prevention A pivotal application of AI in bolstering
    the health and well-being of fish within aquaculture system revolves around disease
    identification and control. Numerous studies have focused on the use of AI for
    disease detection and management, optimization of feeding regimes and management
    of fish reproduction (Fig. 2). In the realm of aquaculture operations, the increasing
    utilization of AI is notably evident in the identification and treatment of fish
    infections (Li et al., 2023). AI can be used in analyzing the data from sensors
    and cameras to find indicators of illness or stress in fish. Cameras, for instance,
    can be used to observe fish behaviour and spot alterations that can point to stress
    or disease, such decreased activity levels or unusual swimming behaviour. Chen
    et al. (2022) reported that advanced disease identification based on fish behaviour
    and external appearance has been identified as a promising field for AI use. In
    addition, this detection system is based on underwater cameras or sensors to capture
    images that are sent through the cloud to the processing unit and scoring system.
    This gives artisanal farmers considerably more time to seek for management solutions
    (Darapaneni et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download

    in aquaculture. Analyzing fish photos for disease indicators is another method
    of applying AI to the identification of disease in fish (Yang et al., 2021). It
    can detect disease symptoms like lesions, odd behaviour, or discolouration by
    examining fish photos captured by cameras in the fish farm (Nik Zad, 2013, Chan
    et al., 2022). This can help farmers in early disease detection and treatment,
    limiting the demand for antibiotics and the risk of outbreaks. This method can
    assist aquaculturists in identifying fish infections sooner, which can enhance
    treatment results and lessen the disease''s ability to spread to other fish populations.
    Analyzing water quality data for disease indicators is another method of employing
    AI for fish disease identification (Setiyowati et al., 2022). Temperature, pH,
    and dissolved oxygen levels are a few examples of water quality variables that
    can have an impact on fish health and reveal the existence of specific diseases.
    AI programmes can be used to examine data on water quality and spot trends that
    can point out the presence of disease (Nayan et al., 2021). AI algorithms can,
    for instance, assess environmental information like temperature, precipitation,
    and nutrition levels to forecast when and where disease outbreaks are likely to
    occur (Elavarasan et al., 2018). This can assist aquaculturists in taking proactive
    steps to stop the spread of disease and lower the possibility of suffering financial
    losses (Rajitha et al., 2007). Besides, the use of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals
    may be decreased by using AI tools and techniques to perform early interventions,
    such as modifying water quality indicators or delivering tailored therapies (Holmes
    et al., 2016). Furthermore, several studies explored the use of AI to analyze
    the video data from salmon farms to detect changes in behaviour that may indicate
    stress or disease. The researchers used a deep learning algorithm to identify
    behavioural patterns in the fish, and were able to detect early signs of disease
    with a high degree of accuracy. Wu et al. (2022) studied four major aspects of
    deep-sea aquaculture including intelligent feeding, water quality detection, biomass
    estimation, and underwater inspection. This transitional development has changed
    the traditional manual way to mechanization, then to automation, hence named as
    unmanned intelligent equipment. Use of these intelligent equipment in various
    fields of aquaculture can reduce labour cost, reduce threats and can increase
    working potential. Lee et al. (2000) used fuzzy logic-based control system for
    denitrification in a closed recirculation system. They developed a computer-control
    denitrifying bioreactor for a system housing squid for biomedical research. This
    Fuzzy logic can be used to process real-time inputs from sensors used to measure
    dissolved oxygen, oxidation–reduction potential and pH and in turn controls the
    pumping rates and addition carbon feed to the bioreactor. Overall, the use of
    AI to fish disease detection has the potential to dramatically enhance the health
    and wellbeing of fish populations raised in aquaculture. Table 3 shows some techniques
    which are being used in disease detection. However, further research is needed
    to explore the full range of applications of AI in aquaculture, and to develop
    more advanced and sophisticated AI algorithms and models. Table 3. Use of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) in disease detection. S. No Disease diagnosis Technique/tool

    For determining fish health and growth rate during the growing stage, biomass
    is one of the most crucial factors (Li et al., 2020). The manual procedure for
    estimating biomass entails sampling using a fishing net or tray, catching each
    fish, weighing them individually, and then calculating the biomass (Martinez-de
    et al., 2003). It is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, which makes
    it difficult to estimate a larger number of samples for precise biomass estimation
    (Cai et al., 2020). Additionally, it shows a higher level of measurement errors
    brought on by human error. This procedure stresses the fish, which may have negative
    consequences like growth retardation, nerve damage, and even death. Manually handling
    dead fish during post-processing for biomass estimation also compromises the texture
    and quality of the product (Zion, 2012). As a result, extensive research has been
    done to investigate alternative techniques for estimating biomass (Li et al.,
    2020). The use of AI offers new opportunities for modern aquaculture. Meanwhile,
    combining machine learning and vision can more precisely estimate fish''s size,
    weight, number, and other biological data. Machine learning and computer vision
    have emerged as powerful tools in various domains and their application in estimating
    the weight of fish showcases their potential in fisheries management and environmental
    monitoring (Monkman et al., 2019). Several studies and research projects have
    explored the use of machine learning algorithms to more accurately estimate the
    weight of fish. One notable approach involves utilizing computer vision techniques
    to analyze images of fish and extract relevant features for weight prediction.
    Bravata et al. (2020) highlights the implementation of convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) to process images of fish and predict their weight with high accuracy.
    The study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing intricate
    patterns and characteristics that contribute to weight variations among different
    fish species. Another study by Lopez-Tejeida et al. (2020) improved a method to
    obtain fish weight using machine learning and NIR camera with Haar Cascade Classifier.
    They reported that by the implementation of hardware and software adds an infrared
    light and pass band filter for the camera successfully, the fish was detected
    automatically, and the fish weight and length were calculated moreover the future
    weight was estimated. a. Size estimates: Body lengths of harvested fish are key
    indices for marine resource management. Some fisheries management organizations
    require fishing vessels to report the lengths of harvested fish (Tseng et al.,
    2020). Conventionally, body lengths of fish are measured manually using rulers
    or tape measures. Such methods are, however, time consuming, labour intensive,
    and subjective. Several researchers have used the ImageNet dataset and the Atlantic
    fish dataset to conduct algorithmic research on estimates of fish size. For estimating
    the length of European bass under various architectures, Monkman et al. (2019)
    suggested the R-CNN model. In addition, the author used OpenCV to calculate the
    image and increase accuracy in light of the image distortion. According to the
    findings, the typical deviation percentage was 2.2 %. b. Age determination: One
    of the main methods of fish age discrimination used presently is the automatic
    interpretation and recognition of fish age using fish otolith images (Bermejo
    et al., 2007). Machine learning has been successfully used for tasks like object
    recognition and other types of image analysis, and it is essential for otolith
    image-based age estimation. In order to determine the age of fish, Moen et al.
    (2018) used deep learning to automatically interpret otolith images and converted
    ImageNet pre-trained parameters to the trained CNN model through transfer learning.
    The experimental outcomes showed that the model performed well and could be used
    to compare the accuracy of artificial experts. The model was unable to accurately
    predict the youngest fish age area, which resulted in low prediction accuracy
    for specific ages. c. Sex determination: For the identification of the sex of
    fish, biological methods were used in the past (Du et al., 2017, Yarmohammadi
    et al., 2017, Webb et al., 2019). These methods had high detection errors and
    caused fish trauma. The machine learning method for identifying fish sex does
    not rely on the quality or age of the fish, but rather on the relative morphological
    parameters of the fish. In parallel, machine vision technology can effectively
    obtain the morphological parameters of the fish. For these reasons, the method
    of combining machine vision and machine learning can obviously identify the sex
    of fish in an effective manner (Barulin, 2017). Barulin (2019) conducted a study
    on Sex identification of starlet sturgeon based on based on scute structure using
    Boruta algorithm/Random forest algorithm. The experimental results showed that
    this approach performs well, and they also offer a positive outlook for using
    AI to determine a species sex. 4. Use of AI in fish feeding. The cost of feeding
    fish accounts for 40–50 % of the total operational cost of aquaculture (Ogunlela
    and Adebayo, 2016), while 60 % of the feed that is dispensed into the aquarium
    becomes particulates (Srivastava and Liu, 2015). These accumulated particles pollute
    the water, which uses oxygen to break them down and release ammonia, nitrogen,
    and other noxious substances that can stunt the growth of fish. While measuring
    the amount of fish feed intake remains a significant challenge, the amount of
    feed dispensed to match fish appetite levels plays a significant role in increasing
    fish productivity. AI can also help to optimize feeding of fish and AI software
    can calculate the ideal feeding schedule and serving size. This could improve
    feed use, reduce waste, and foster fish growth and health. One important area
    where AI can have a significant impact on fish behaviour, appetite, and growth
    rates is aquaculture feeding optimization. By taking into account elements like
    water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and the nutritional content of feed,
    AI may be used to develop prediction models that determine the ideal feeding schedule
    and quantity for a certain fish population. Through waste and the chance of overfeeding,
    this can have a detrimental effect on the environment by resulting in contaminated
    water. By reading the sensors in real-time, an optimal model for artificial intelligence
    may be employed to determine the shrimp biomass and determine the proper amount
    (Chen et al., 2022). AI can also be used to assess fish behaviour and hunger in
    real-time in addition to optimising feeding schedules. It has been reported that
    cameras and sensors can be used to keep an eye on activities like feeding, swimming,
    and other signs of stress or hunger (Barreto et al., 2022). Fish will then receive
    the ideal quantity of nutrition to support their growth and development by using
    this information to change feeding schedules and amounts in real-time (Lafont
    et al., 2022). Studies have reported that AI can also be used to develop individualised
    feeding plans for each fish, taking into account their genetic make-up, age, and
    body weight (Reyed, 2023). Precision aquaculture is a method for maximising growth
    rates and minimising the overall environmental effect of aquaculture operations
    (O''Donncha and Grant, 2019). Using AI for feeding optimization can significantly
    increase fish growth rates, appetite, and behaviour in aquaculture while lowering
    waste and having a minimally detrimental environmental impact (Føre et al., 2018).
    5. Use of AI in promoting growth rates. The optimal temperature for the growth
    of fish varies, depends on the species of fish reared. Maintenance of the optimal
    temperature, fish farmers can promote faster growth rates and larger fish (Uddin
    et al., 2022). However, if the temperature rises too high or too low, it can negatively
    impact growth rates (Sivri et al., 2007). There are several ways in which growth
    rates, aquaculture, and AI are interconnected. Foremost factor is to monitor growth
    rate. The growth rates of these organisms are critical to the success of the aquaculture
    industry. AI can be used to monitor and manage the growth rates of these organisms,
    ensuring optimal conditions for growth and maximizing production. In the current
    era modern and innovative and technical instrumental devices are using stereoscopic
    observations to measure the size, observe the shape, position and behaviour of
    fish and shrimps. It has been reported that “Sonar cameras” converts sound echoes
    into video images to use them in dark or turbid environments (Li et al., 2020).
    Studies have reported that water quality can be monitored in three dimensional
    in cages and large tanks by using autonomous vehicles that lift and lowers the
    sensor to develop 3-D data profiles (Edan et al., 2009). Whereas indoor recirculatory
    aquaculture system and underwater net-pen production environment were found more
    stable (Using sonar to help farmers solve the biomass problem, 2022). Moreover,
    AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast the growth rates
    of aquatic organisms (Hmoud Al-Adhaileh & Waselallah Alsaade, 2021). To effectively
    estimate growth rates, these models can take into account a variety of environmental
    variables, including water temperature, oxygen concentrations, and nutrition availability
    (Ansari et al., 2021). This can help farmers in reducing waste and streamlining
    their production processes. Based on a fish species'' development rate, water
    temperature, and other environmental conditions, a prediction model can be used
    to establish the ideal feeding rate for that species (Ghandar et al., 2021). In
    order to help farmers organise their operations more efficiently, the model may
    also forecast the anticipated yield and the date of harvest. Predictive models
    can not only increase manufacturing efficiency but also help stop disease outbreaks.
    Predictive models can identify early indications of stress or disease in aquatic
    species through environmental monitoring, enabling farmers to take preventative
    action and lessen the effect on production (Bell et al., 2022). Predictive modelling
    is a useful tool for farmers who want to maximise output while minimising environmental
    effect since it can boost growth rates, efficiency, and sustainability in aquaculture
    (Das et al., 2022). Another study examined the use of AI to optimize feeding regimes
    for salmon. They use machine learning algorithms to develop personalized feeding
    programs based on individual fish characteristics, and were able to achieve significant
    improvements in growth rates and feed conversion ratios (Barreto et al., 2022).
    AI algorithms may create individualised feeding schedules that satisfy each fish''s
    unique nutritional needs and maximise growth rates by accessing data on feeding
    behaviour and development rates (Metcalfe, 2019). 6. Use of AI in sustainability,
    efficiency and behaviour of fish. Aquaculture has the potential to be a sustainable
    food supply, but it needs to be carefully managed to prevent harm to the environment.
    It has been reported that AI can be employed to keep an eye on environmental factors
    like water quality, fertiliser levels, waste reduction, and productivity (Krishnan
    et al., 2021). The use of AI in aquaculture has the potential to boost productivity,
    promote sustainability, reduce disease outbreaks, and improve growth rates, making
    aquaculture a more viable and long-term source of food (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023).
    Fish feeding habits, activity levels, and social relationships can all be affected
    by temperature conditions. Certain fish species have been found to grow more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Some fish species are known to become more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Well-known examples are tilapia, a common freshwater fish
    raised for food that has been demonstrated to become more aggressive in warmer
    temperatures. This is thought to be caused by changes in their metabolism, which
    can have an impact on how they behave. Popular sport fish, largemouth bass have
    been seen to become more hostile in warmer water temperatures. This is assumed
    to be caused by changes in their food habits and increased metabolic activity.
    The behavior of various fish species in response to temperature changes is a fascinating
    area of study. Bluegills, a popular freshwater sunfish, exhibit increased aggression
    in warmer water likely due to heightened competition for resources such as food
    and habitat (Barber, 2007). Similarly, Atlantic salmon have been found to become
    more aggressive in warmer climates, which can lead to higher stress levels and
    increased succeptibility to diseases, potentially impacting their overall health
    and productivity (Portz et al., 2006, Svenning et al., 2022).). Coldwater fish
    called yellow perch have been seen to grow more aggressive in warmer weather (Stasko
    et al., 2012). Their feeding habits may vary as a result, and there may be more
    competition for few resources. Depending on the species and the particular environmental
    factors, the effect of rising temperatures on fish aggression may differ. Nonetheless,
    it is widely acknowledged that variations in water temperature can significantly
    affect fish behaviour as well as their general health and wellbeing. Several fish
    species become less active as a result of their slowed metabolisms and the need
    to conserve energy to keep their bodies warm in colder climates (Reeve et al.,
    2022). Which include a few fish species that slowdown in cooler weather (Power
    et al., 1999). Coldwater fish like trout become less active when the temperature
    drops. In order to save energy, they are known to seek out warmer water, such
    as at the surface or close to a warm tributary''s outflow (Heggenes et al., 2021).
    Another fish species that slows down in cooler weather is the catfish. As the
    water temperature is more consistent and they can preserve energy, they are known
    to go to deeper parts of a body of water. Freshwater fish with a wide tolerance
    for temperature variation include carp. However, they are known to become less
    active in colder temperatures and will often move to deeper areas of a body of
    water to conserve energy (Ficke et al., 2007). Pike are a type of predatory fishes
    that slowdown in cooler weather. They are known to travel to warmer water in deeper
    parts of a body of water where they can conserve energy. Besides, popular sport
    fish, walleye, become less active in cooler weather. In order to preserve energy,
    they are known to seek out warmer water, for example, close to a warm tributary''s
    outflow. This shows that depending on the species and the particular environmental
    conditions, the effects of cooler temperatures on fish activity might differ (Huntingford
    et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it is widely acknowledged that variations in water
    temperature can significantly affect fish behaviour as well as their general health
    and wellbeing. Consequently, fish producers can encourage healthy behaviours that
    produce fish with better health by maximising the temperature circumstances (Craig
    et al., 2017). The Tokyo-based Umitron Corporation created the Umitron''s system,
    a system for tracking swimmer behaviour, using AI technology. This system makes
    decisions about when and how much feed should be supplied in each fish cage based
    on real-time observation of swimming behaviour. This approach significantly reduces
    trash production, transportation and logistical needs compared to daily feeding
    as well as feed transformation efficiency. The fish are sold under the name “AI
    Sumagastsuo” in Tokyo (Umitron launches feed optimisation and mortality estimation
    software, 2022). 7. Use of AI in reproduction The study of reproductive mechanisms
    is crucial across various organisms, including, humans, animals, and plants, each
    with unique reproductive processes. Temperature plays a significant role in fish
    reproduction as certain species require specific temperature ranges for successful
    spawning. Fishermen can encourage effective reproduction and increase the number
    of fish in their farm by adjusting the temperature conditions. Freshwater or saltwater
    habitats can be used for aquaculture, which can use a variety of techniques include
    tank-based systems, net-pen systems, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.
    It has been studied that in aquaculture, AI can be used to enhance feeding and
    water quality, regulate fish populations, and prevent disease outbreaks (Prapti
    et al., 2022). Research on reproduction can be used in aquaculture to create fresh
    breeding plans that will boost the wellbeing and output of populations of farmed
    fish. In addition, there have been several studies exploring the use of AI for
    the management of fish reproduction. For example, one of the studies developed
    a predictive model to identify the optimal conditions for egg production in striped
    bass. Moreover, previous literature suggests that the use of AI in aquaculture
    has significant potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the
    industry. By enabling more effective management of fish reproduction, feeding,
    and growth (Mustapha et al., 2021), AI can lead to improved fish health and well-being,
    as well as increased productivity and profitability for fish farmers (Ubina and
    Cheng, 2022, Khan et al., 2018). 8. Use of AI in breeding programs. Based on genomic
    data, AI can be used to create prediction models of fish performance, allowing
    for more effective and focused breeding programmes for qualities like disease
    resistance and growth rate. AI systems may find genetic differences associated
    with particular features by analysing vast amounts of genomic data, and they can
    then utilise this knowledge to create prediction models of fish performance (Dixit
    et al., 2023). The performance of various fish populations under various environmental
    situations may thus be predicted using these models, as well as the top candidates
    for breeding to achieve particular objectives like disease resistance or growth
    rate. AI enables breeding operations to be more targeted and effective, which
    saves time and money while achieving desired features. By increasing the productivity
    and sustainability of fish populations, this can have a large positive impact
    on aquaculture and fisheries management (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023). Therefore, the
    use of AI and breeding programmes together has great potential to advance the
    fields of aquaculture and fisheries management as well as genetic quality and
    performance of fish populations. 9. Use of AI in conservation genetics. AI can
    be used to analyze genetic data from endangered or threatened fish species, enabling
    better understanding of their genetic diversity and potential for conservation.
    The conservation of these species is important for maintaining healthy aquatic
    ecosystems and preserving the biodiversity of our planet. Endangered or threatened
    fish species face many challenges, including overfishing, habitat loss, pollution,
    and climate change. In order to overcome these problems, conservation genetics
    can play a crucial role in understanding and addressing these challenges. Analysis
    of genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify distinct populations
    within a species, as well as the genetic diversity within and among these populations
    (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024).This information can be used to develop more effective
    conservation strategies, such as targeting conservation efforts to areas with
    high genetic diversity or prioritizing the protection of distinct populations
    that may be more vulnerable to extinction (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024). Researchers
    can use AI to track alterations in the genetic diversity of fish populations that
    are at danger of extinction. They can also evaluate the success of conservation
    methods and spot possible dangers to the long-term survival of a species by monitoring
    changes in genetic diversity. AI can also assist researchers in finding genetic
    markers linked to characteristics like disease resistance or successful reproduction
    that are crucial for the survival and procreation of fish species (Palaiokostas,
    2021).. Using this knowledge, breeding strategies may be created that put an emphasis
    on maintaining certain qualities and support the species long-term survival. In
    general, the application of AI to conservation genetics can assist us in understanding
    and preserving fish species that are in danger of extinction and are crucial to
    the health of our aquatic ecosystems and the lives of those who depend on them.
    Conservation genetics is an important field that aims to understand and preserve
    the genetic diversity of endangered or threatened species. AI can be a valuable
    tool in this field, as it can help researchers analyze large amounts of genetic
    data more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods (Xu et al., 2021).
    By analyzing genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify patterns
    of genetic diversity within a species, such as the presence of unique or rare
    alleles. This information can then be used to develop effective conservation strategies,
    such as targeted breeding programs or the establishment of protected habitats.
    Additionally, AI can help researchers identify potential threats to the genetic
    diversity of endangered species, such as the introduction of invasive species
    or habitat destruction (Branco et al., 2023). By identifying these threats early
    on, conservationists can take action to mitigate their impact and preserve the
    genetic diversity of vulnerable species. Overall, the use of AI in conservation
    genetics has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of endangered
    and threatened species and help ensure their long-term survival. Overall, AI holds
    the promise of revolutionising the research of fish genomes and opening up new
    possibilities for aquaculture, fishery management, and environmental conservation.
    The ethical ramifications of genetic tools based on AI, though, are also a source
    of worry, and it''s important to make sure they''re used sustainably and responsibly.
    As a result, it''s critical to carefully weigh the possible advantages and disadvantages
    of AI in fish genome analysis and to make sure it''s applied in a way that''s
    advantageous to both people and the environment. Hence, AI has the potential to
    change the aquaculture sector by enabling more profitable, efficient, and sustainable
    production techniques. Yet, there are also worries about the price and availability
    of AI technology, as well as potential moral dilemmas with the treatment of animals
    and the environment. To ensure that AI is utilised responsibly and sustainably,
    it is crucial to thoroughly weigh the potential advantages and hazards of its
    usage in aquaculture. 10. Use of AI in fish genome. AI has the potential to revolutionise
    the study of fish genomes by enabling a speedier and more precise analysis of
    genetic data and accelerating the development of new genetic tools for use in
    aquaculture and fisheries management (Song et al., 2023). Fish genome research
    is one area where AI has showed considerable potential (Ditria et al., 2022).
    AI can assist researchers in swiftly and accurately analysing enormous amounts
    of genetic data due to the growing complexity of data analysis techniques and
    the availability of genomic data (De Alwis et al., 2022). In order to detect genetic
    variations and comprehend the activities of particular genes, it can be incredibly
    helpful for AI algorithms to learn from enormous amounts of data in order to recognise
    patterns and make predictions. By detecting desirable genetic features and enabling
    the selection of the best candidates for breeding, AI can assist in aquaculture
    and fisheries management to improve the breeding of fish species. By examining
    genetic diversity and locating genetic markers that can be used to follow fish
    movements and population changes, it can also assist in the monitoring of fish
    populations. AI can also be utilised to create novel genetic tools that can be
    used to improve the health and production of fish, such as gene editing technology
    (Rasal and Sundaray, 2020). AI has the potential to significantly advance the
    study of fish genomes, leading to important breakthroughs in aquaculture and fisheries
    management. Some of the potential applications of AI in fish genome analysis include:
    11. Use of AI in genome sequencing and editing. Large volumes of genomic data
    may be analysed using AI, allowing for quicker and more precise genome sequencing
    and assembly. AI can speed up the process of genome sequencing, a critical tool
    for determining the genetic makeup of fish species (Ruppert et al., 2019). AI
    algorithms can assist researchers in finding the most pertinent and instructive
    regions of the genome and speed up the synthesis of high-quality genome sequences
    by processing enormous amounts of genomic data. This can be very advantageous
    for fish breeding and selection in aquaculture. For instance, researchers can
    find desired features like disease resistance, rapid growth, and environmental
    adaptation by sequencing the genomes of several fish populations and examining
    genetic variants. Researchers can choose the best candidates for breeding with
    the use of AI, which can make the process much quicker and more precise than conventional
    techniques (Xue et al., 2023). This will ultimately increase the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture operations. In order to advance the research
    of fish genomes and enhance aquaculture techniques, AI and genome sequencing hold
    immense potential. In order to change fish genomes more effectively and precisely
    for purposes like increased growth and disease resistance, AI can be used to design
    and refine genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 (Ferdous et al., 2022).
    The science of genome editing, which makes use of instruments like CRISPR-Cas9,
    holds great promise for enhancing features in fish species including disease resistance
    and growth (Houston et al., 2020). Unfortunately, developing and refining genome
    editing technologies can take a lot of time and resources. By anticipating the
    most efficient target areas for genome editing and refining the CRISPR-Cas9 system''s
    design for optimum effectiveness and precision, AI can speed up this process (Jones
    and Wilson, 2022). AI systems can discover potential off-target effects and reduce
    the danger of unintentional modifications to the genome by evaluating vast volumes
    of genetic data. Researchers can create more effective and precise genome editing
    tools for use in aquaculture and fisheries management with the aid of AI. For
    instance, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to change existing features to better fit changing
    environmental conditions or to introduce desired genetic traits such as disease
    resistance or increased growth into fish populations (Roy et al., 2022). Overall,
    the development of new genetic tools and interventions that can improve the health
    and resilience of fish populations is made possible by the combination of AI and
    genome editing technologies, which has enormous potential for improving the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture and fisheries management. Major challenges One
    problem is the absence of clear data and data sharing guidelines. A large amount
    of high-quality data is required to develop effective AI models and algorithms.
    There is currently a lack of common data formats and protocols to facilitate data
    sharing across different aquaculture enterprises and research institutions. This
    limits the application of AI in aquaculture and creates difficulties in collecting
    and analysing large amounts of data. Mustapha et al. (2021) reported that, there
    are various limitations and challenges that may hinder the extensive adoption
    of AI in aquaculture. One of them is security concerns associated with many levels
    of the interconnected systems and networks that will be required. It requires
    complex data acquisition to convert it into meaningfully capture the complexity
    and biological interactions found in many production systems. Deep learning AI
    requires large amounts of training data, which is typically difficult to come
    by. For some applications, this is further compounded by the turbidity and bio-fouling
    associated with many culture systems. Finally, cost-benefit considerations will
    largely determine the extent and pace of AI adoption. But the long term trends
    for adoption are increasingly apparent. In order to develop effective AI algorithms
    and models, large amounts of high-quality data are required. However, there is
    currently a lack of standardized data formats and protocols for sharing data across
    different aquaculture operations and research institutions. This makes it difficult
    to collect and analyze large amounts of data, and limits the effectiveness of
    AI in aquaculture. Aquaculture operations involve a wide range of variables, such
    as water quality, temperature, and feed inputs, that can interact in complex ways
    to affect fish health and growth. Developing AI algorithms and models that can
    effectively capture and analyze these complex interactions is a major challenge
    that will require continued research and development. Developing and implementing
    AI systems in aquaculture can be expensive, particularly for smaller-scale operations.
    There may be a need for investment in infrastructure and technology to support
    the implementation of AI in aquaculture. As AI systems rely on large amounts of
    sensitive data, there is a need to ensure that data is securely stored and transmitted,
    and that data privacy is maintained. Skill and knowledge gaps Data analysis, software
    development, and aquaculture domain knowledge are just a few of the abilities
    needed to build and implement AI systems in aquaculture. Programs for education
    and training might be required to fill in skill and knowledge gaps. These challenges
    need to be addressed if aquaculture is to completely benefit from AI. By creating
    effective AI models and algorithms, addressing concerns with data sharing, complexity,
    cost, privacy, and data security, AI can help aquaculture operations become more
    sustainable and efficient while also providing a stable and secure supply of high-quality
    seafood for the growing global population. It can also help close skill and knowledge
    gaps. Another issue is the creation of sophisticated AI models and algorithms
    that can account for the intricate and dynamic structure of aquaculture systems.
    A few of the several variables that can interact intimately in aquaculture operations
    to affect fish health and growth are temperature, feed inputs, and water quality.
    It will take ongoing research and development to create AI models and algorithms
    that can successfully record and evaluate these intricate interactions. Conclusion
    Because AI makes it possible to regulate fish growth, feeding, and reproduction
    more effectively and over the long term, the aquaculture industry could undergo
    a total transformation. AI can improve decision-making speed and accuracy, decrease
    the need for antibiotics, and lower the negative environmental effects of aquaculture
    operations. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be solved before
    aquaculture can completely benefit from AI. Some of them include the lack of standardized
    data and data communication protocols, as well as the need for advanced AI models
    and algorithms that can account for the complex and dynamic nature of aquaculture
    systems. Notwithstanding these challenges, the future of aquaculture AI looks
    bright. The aquaculture industry will likely see an increase in the use of AI
    as technology grows. Thanks to AI, fish production can be managed more effectively
    and sustainably, providing a consistent and safe supply of premium seafood for
    the world''s growing population. Future recommendations Despite these difficulties,
    aquaculture AI has a promising future. The advancements in sensor technology and
    data collection techniques have made it easier to collect and share high-quality
    data. Additionally, the progress in machine learning and deep learning algorithms
    allows for more sophisticated analysis of large datasets. As these technologies
    continue to evolve in the aquaculture sector, AI is expected to play a more significant
    role in the effective and sustainable management of fish production, as well as
    in improving the overall health and well-being of farmed fish. The following suggestions
    for upcoming research and development will help aquaculture fully reap the potential
    advantages of AI: Standardization of data and data sharing protocols Standardized
    data formats and protocols must be established in order to facilitate data exchange
    among various aquaculture companies and research institutes. This will make it
    possible to gather and evaluate vast volumes of high-quality data and will speed
    up the creation of efficient AI models and algorithms. AI algorithms and models
    need to be developed that can effectively capture and analyze the complex interactions
    between variables in aquaculture operations, such as water quality, temperature,
    and feed inputs. AI systems need to be integrated with existing aquaculture technologies,
    such as sensors and cameras, to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making.
    There is a need to develop low-cost AI systems that are accessible to smaller-scale
    aquaculture operations, and that can help to improve the efficiency and sustainability
    of these operations. AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast
    fish growth, feed requirements, and disease outbreaks, enabling more effective
    and efficient management of aquaculture operations. Collaboration between the
    aquaculture industry and academia can help to bridge skill and knowledge gaps,
    and facilitate the development and implementation of AI systems in aquaculture.
    By addressing these recommendations, AI can help to improve the efficiency and
    sustainability of aquaculture operations, and ensure a reliable and secure source
    of high-quality seafood for the growing global population. CRediT authorship contribution

    for addressing climate change and realizing sustainable development. Based on

    reduces ALCE and ALCI, and the conclusions are robust to a battery of tests. Furthermore,
    (2) mechanism analysis reveals that GCRA primarily uses three mechanisms—strengthening
    environmental regulation, promoting agricultural green-technology innovation,
    and upgrading agricultural-land mechanization—to reduce ALCE and lower ALCI. Additionally,
    (3) heterogeneity analysis suggests that the carbon-emission reduction effect
    of GCRA is more significant in the east, in arid and humid climate zones, and
    in non-grain-producing regions. Finally, (4) spatial-spillover effect analysis
    and quantile regression results demonstrate that GCRA also significantly inhibits
    carbon emissions and the carbon intensity of nearby agricultural land, with the
    inhibition effect becoming more pronounced at higher levels of government attention.
    This study's discoveries are helpful in promoting the emission reduction and carbon
    sequestration of agricultural land and provide references for developing countries

    • GCRA contributes to advancing carbon mitigation and reducing carbon intensity
    within agricultural land. This conclusion retains its validity even following
    a battery of rigorous tests for robustness. • Mechanism analysis indicates that
    GCRA primarily promotes ALCE and ALCI reduction by strengthening environmental
    regulation, promoting agricultural green-technology innovation, and upgrading
    agricultural-land mechanization. • Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that in
    the eastern regions, arid and humid climate zones, and non-grain-producing areas,
    GCRA has a more significant effect on carbon and carbon-intensity reduction in
    agricultural land. • Spatial-spillover analysis and quantile tests indicate that
    GCRA also has a significant inhibitory effect on neighboring ALCE and ALCI. Moreover,

    Introduction Global socio-economic growth is significantly impacted by increasing
    global warming and the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events, such as
    heat waves, cold waves, strong winds, droughts, and heavy rainfall (Nordhaus,
    2019). One of the main causes of the growing severity of climate change has been
    acknowledged to be increased carbon emissions (Gans, 2012). The Sixth Assessment
    Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that the carbon
    emissions from global agricultural land account for approximately 21% of the total
    global carbon emissions. When considering indirect carbon emissions such as those
    from the consumption of agricultural products, agricultural-land carbon emissions
    (ALCE) will constitute one-third of global carbon emissions; therefore, lowering
    ALCE and agricultural-land carbon intensity (ALCI) to slow down global warming
    has emerged as a critical global issue (Zhao et al., 2023). As the number one
    agricultural country, China''s agricultural-land area accounts for approximately
    9% of the global agricultural-land area, and by 2050, China''s agricultural-sector
    carbon emissions may become the second-largest carbon-emitting sector after industry
    (Lin et al., 2022). Fig. 1 illustrates the trajectory of alterations in China''s
    agricultural land. Therefore, to fulfill the specific measures outlined in the
    Paris Agreement and address the threats of climate-change risks, in 2022, the
    Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of China and the National Development
    and Reform Commission jointly issued the “Implementation Plan for Emission Reduction
    and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Rural Areas.” This plan explicitly
    emphasizes the need to accelerate the reduction of emissions and carbon sequestration
    in agricultural and rural areas, lower the greenhouse-gas emission (GHG) intensity
    in agricultural and rural production and living, and enhance the adaptive capacity
    of Chinese agricultural production to climate change, which would positively contribute
    to global efforts to combat climate change. To promote emission and carbon reduction
    on agricultural land, the Chinese government has launched a series of programs,
    such as the National Agricultural Sustainable Development Experimental Demonstration
    Zone policy (Du et al., 2023b) and the new agricultural-subsidy policy (Fan et
    al., 2023). Moreover, existing research on ALCE predominantly focuses on specific
    policies already implemented by the government, overlooking the forward-looking
    and guiding impact highlighted in the “Government Work Report” concerning the
    need to address climate-change risks and promote sustainable development. Download

    in agricultural land use. According to attention theory, in a situation of limited
    attention, it is difficult for the government to simultaneously pay attention
    to issues in all fields with the same attention intensity (Augier, 2002). By raising
    attention to climate-change risks in the government work report, the government
    can intuitively reflect on its importance as a decision-maker, which implies that
    its resource allocation and energy investment will be tilted toward coping with
    climate warming; moreover, it will leverage “political momentum” to intensify
    efforts to reduce emissions and carbon sequestration in agricultural land, thus
    promoting new advancements in climate change. The Government Work Report is a
    programmatic policy text issued by the Chinese government, which intuitively reflects
    the degree of attention and importance of the government as a decision-maker.
    It serves as a baton with which governments of all stripes can distribute funds
    and exert effort. It is also a crucial carrier for the government''s attention
    allocation or change (Liu et al., 2023c). Given China''s “centralized” and “decentralized”
    macro-governance frameworks, local governments have consistently taken the lead
    in advancing emission and carbon reduction and sustainable development. Therefore,
    in the context of increasing global warming and rising carbon emissions from agricultural
    land, will governments take action to influence agricultural-land emission and
    carbon reduction when they realize the potential climate risks? How will it influence
    ALCE and ALCI? These are the main issues explored in this study. Little academic
    research has been conducted on government climate-risk attention (GCRA). Only
    a few studies have focused on the government''s environmental attention (Holka
    et al., 2022; Powlson et al., 2014). Moreover, the keywords used to construct
    these indicators mostly relate to carbon emission and environmental pollution
    (e.g., carbon dioxide, environmental protection, air quality, etc.) and do not
    contain words related to extreme weather. Thus, they cannot accurately portray
    the government''s climate-risk attention. Consequently, to deeply examine the
    impact of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI, this study constructs an indicator of GCRA based
    on the government work reports of each prefecture-level city in China and conducts
    empirical tests thereon. However, due to the complexity of the Chinese language,
    which leads to a complex expression of semantics in the context of government
    work reports, a significant inaccuracy may arise if the dictionary method is directly
    utilized to measure GCRA (Nagar and Schoenfeld, 2022). Suppose the dictionary
    method is directly utilized for word-frequency statistics without the aid of machine
    learning or many manual workers to study the corpus. In that case, it is impossible
    to accurately determine the multiple descriptions of Chinese words within the
    government work-report corpus, resulting in the omission of many factors in measuring
    indicators. The word “mangkhut,” for example, may mean fruit in other contexts
    but typhoon in the context of a government work report. Therefore, the use of
    Word2Vec and text analysis methods can more accurately obtain the government''s
    attention for climate risk in the context of the government work report, and capture
    some easily missed words. The use of Word2vec mitigates the problem of subjectivity
    in word selection to a certain extent and is therefore a good complement to the
    traditional dictionary method. Specifically, we use crawler technology to obtain
    the text of government work reports of 296 prefecture-level cities in China from
    2011 to 2021 and use machine-learning and text-analysis techniques to determine
    the word set for government climate-risk concern. Finally, we use the dictionary
    method to derive word-frequency statistics to construct the government climate-risk
    concern index in the Chinese context. We then verify that the indicator can effectively
    measure the Chinese government''s concern about climate risk through the difference-in-differences
    (DID) and actual comparative methods. The study further empirically examines the
    impact of GCRA on emission and carbon reduction in agricultural land and its mechanism
    and spatial-spillover effect. The study provides a crucial reference for promoting
    the emission and carbon reduction of agricultural land, responding to climate
    change and completing the “carbon peak” and “carbon neutrality” goals. This research
    contributes marginally to four areas of the literature. First, it fills a gap
    in the research perspectives. Current research on climate change and ALCE chiefly
    focuses on policy and technology, such as the national agricultural sustainable
    development pilot zone and new agricultural-subsidy policies, agricultural-emission
    reduction technology (Powlson et al., 2014), and organic agriculture (Holka et
    al., 2022). Starting from the GCRA, this study investigates how it affects ALCE
    and ALCI, providing a new research perspective for future carbon reduction in
    agricultural use. Second, we introduce machine-learning and text-analysis methods
    into the research on GCRA, propose a new text indicator to estimate the government''s
    attention to climate-risk events, and administer a novel idea for combining economics
    and machine-learning research in the future. Simultaneously, we broaden the research
    scope on the correlation between global climate change and ALCE. Third, this study
    addresses the mechanism through which GCRA impacts ALCE from the three perspectives
    of environmental regulation, agricultural-mechanization level, and agricultural
    green-technology innovation. Accordingly, our study opens up the theoretical “black
    box” between the two. Fourth, this study investigates the spatial-spillover effects
    of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI from a spatial perspective, which affords theoretical
    and empirical assistance for regional synergistic emission reduction in agricultural
    land. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents
    the theoretical hypotheses and literature review. Section 3 introduces the research
    design. Section 4 reports the empirical analysis. Section 5 contains mechanism
    analysis, followed by further analysis in Section 6. Section 7 concludes and provides
    policy implications. 2. Theoretical hypotheses and literature review 2.1. GCRA
    and ALCE “Attention” was originally a topic of extensive study in psychology and
    was defined as the process of entering consciousness. Simon (1990) introduced
    “attention” into economic research by linking it with managers'' decision-making
    and pointed out that “information is not the factor of real scarcity, but the
    factor of real scarcity is ‘attention,’ and the change of ‘attention’ may cause
    the huge difference in choice.” Jones (1994) further introduced the theory of
    “attention” into the study of government attention and then proposed the “attention-driven
    policy choice model; ” when the government''s attention to a certain issue changes,
    its policy will also change. As GHG emissions continue to rise and climate risks
    intensify, numerous studies have been conducted on achieving GHG-emission reductions
    based on the level of government attention. Liu et al. (2023c) utilized the proportion
    of environmental keywords in government work reports to portray the government''s
    environmental concern and empirically examined whether the government''s environmental
    concern could help to promote enterprises'' emission and carbon reduction. Murray
    (2004) used government work-report data to construct a government economic-growth
    attention indicator using a textual analysis method and found that the lower the
    government''s economic-growth attention, the lower the carbon emissions. However,
    existing studies have rarely mentioned the impact of GCRA on carbon-emission reduction
    from agricultural land, and only some studies have examined the effect of carbon
    reduction on agricultural land from the perspectives of policy and agricultural
    technology. Bauernschuster et al. (2022) pointed out that reasonable agricultural
    policies played a crucial role in the success or failure and efficiency of agricultural
    carbon-emission reduction from the perspective of government policies such as
    the tax standards and subsidy prices formulated by the government. Davidson and
    Gu (2012) discussed the impact of government land-conservation policies on ALCE.
    Du et al. (2023b) empirically examined whether China''s national experimental
    demonstration zones for sustainable agricultural-development policy significantly
    inhibited ALCE using prefecture-level city data in China. From a technical perspective,
    ALCE primarily stem from inputs of agricultural-production factors, including
    fertilizers, agricultural diesel, mulching films, and pesticides (Guo and Zhang,
    2023). A study by Shi et al. (2022) shows that technological innovation in agricultural-production
    factors, such as straw returning to the field, water-saving irrigation, and other
    technologies, are beneficial for enhancing agricultural-land efficiency and advancing
    emission and carbon reduction in agricultural land. Although gaps remain in the
    literature on GCRA and ALCE, against the background of sustainable development,
    such as “carbon peak” and “carbon neutrality,” the government will certainly pay
    increasingly more attention to climate risk. Moreover, as the main source of carbon
    emissions, agricultural land is also a key target for the government to reduce
    carbon emissions (Ahmed et al., 2023). Therefore, the following research hypothesis
    is proposed. Hypothesis 1 Increased GCRA is conducive to promoting a reduction
    in ALCE and ALCI. 2.2. Analysis of the mechanism through which GCRA reduces ALCE
    First, from the perspective of government environmental regulation, why government
    policies are formulated, promulgated, and implemented is closely related to the
    policy environment (Jones, 1994). At present, global warming is becoming increasingly
    severe, and many countries are strengthening environmental regulations to varying
    degrees to restrain GHG emissions and mitigate climate change. Ahmed et al. (2023)
    found that increased environmental regulation significantly impacted regional
    ALCE reduction by examining environmental-regulation policies in the United States
    (U.S). Based on the Chinese perspective, He et al. (2022) analyzed the intrinsic
    relationship between the strength of government environmental regulation and agricultural
    land carbon intensity (ALCI), and their results showed that with increased environmental-regulation
    intensity, ALCI showed an increasingly obvious downward trend. In addition, Dumortier
    and Elobeid (2021) demonstrated that developed countries’ environmental-regulation
    policies played a positive role in the emission and carbon reduction from agricultural
    land. Second, agricultural green-technology innovation is a key component in promoting
    agricultural-resource conservation and increasing agricultural yields; it also
    serves as a crucial driver for achieving the decarbonization of agricultural land
    and ensuring agricultural sustainability (Greenhalgh, 2016). Wang et al. (2023a)
    examined four agricultural green technologies, including automatic composting
    technology, which verified the promotion effect of agricultural green-technology
    innovation on ALCE. Sun et al. (2020) further pointed out that optimizing the
    relationships among energy, water, and agricultural waste in agricultural-land
    systems was conducive to achieving sustainable agricultural development, and agricultural
    green-technology innovations could extend this effect. More specifically, innovations
    in agricultural water-saving technologies can realize the recycling of fertilizers
    and water resources, thereby reducing the carbon emissions generated from fertilizer
    use (Sanyé-Mengual et al., 2015). Furthermore, green innovations in agricultural-waste
    recycling allow organic solid waste to be used as agricultural fertilizer, thus
    avoiding the carbon emissions generated by waste-disposal processes such as landfilling,
    incineration, and transportation (Chia et al., 2020; Mu et al., 2017). Finally,
    from the perspective of upgrading agricultural mechanization, increased GCRA signifies
    that the government will continue to advance efforts to mitigate climate change,
    introduce more carbon-reducing agenda for agricultural land, and provide more
    financial support to enhance the level of agricultural mechanization. Existing
    research has indicated that agricultural mechanization, as a representation of
    advanced productivity, can considerably improve the quality and efficiency of
    agricultural land, subsequently reducing regional ALCE (Benin, 2015). Qiao (2017)''s
    research has also demonstrated that agricultural mechanization contributes to
    bettering agricultural-land conditions, adjusting the agricultural-industry structure,
    and realizing the sustainable development of agricultural land. Therefore, the
    following hypothesis is proposed. Hypothesis 2 GCRA promotes ALCE and ALCI reduction
    by strengthening environmental regulation, promoting agricultural green-technology
    innovation, and upgrading agricultural-land mechanization. 2.3. Analysis of spatial-spillover
    effects of GCRA Local governments play a crucial leadership role in climate-change
    mitigation efforts. When local governments are aware of climate-change risks,
    they will formulate diversified policies to alleviate the detrimental shocks of
    climate change (Yeganeh et al., 2020). However, the impact of climate change is
    extensive and not limited to a single jurisdiction; it can be spread across multiple
    provinces and even have a national impact. Research by Boehnke et al. (2019),
    Hsu et al. (2019), Mi et al. (2019), and Reckien et al. (2018) suggests that the
    effectiveness of local-government climate-mitigation policies depends in part
    on their collaboration across jurisdictions. Due to variations in geographical
    locations, different regions have distinct climates and different regional governments
    have amassed diverse experience in mitigating the detrimental impacts of individualized
    climate change (Adekoya et al., 2022; Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006). Wu et al. (2015)
    found that the horizontal coordination and partnership of local governments in
    climate-change mitigation was beneficial for reducing regional ALCE and ALCI.
    Therefore, an analysis of the spatial perspective is indispensable when considering
    issues related to climate change. In addition, numerous studies have shown significant
    spatial correlations in carbon emissions. Wang et al.’s (2024) research demonstrates
    the spatial effects of new-energy demonstration cities on regional carbon-emission
    suppression. Liu et al.’s (2023b) study demonstrates the spatial-spillover effect
    of the pilot information-consumption policy on urban carbon emissions, which not
    only has a significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions in the pilot area
    but also has an inhibitory effect on carbon emissions in neighboring areas. Apparently,
    previous studies have mainly explored the spatial-spillover effects of relevant
    government policies on regional carbon emissions, without examining those of GCRA
    on regional ALCE and ALCI. Given the wide-ranging nature of the impacts of climate
    change, a greater need arises for horizontal coordination to enhance the effectiveness
    of government efforts when mitigating climate change. Now that horizontal government
    coordination has been demonstrated, governments may strengthen climate-risk attention
    and increase the governance of ALCE when they are more concerned about climate
    risk. Meanwhile, to better ensure the effectiveness of government efforts, local
    governments may develop synergistic governance among themselves. That is, a high
    level of GCRA may influence the climate-risk attention of neighboring governments,
    which may have the impact of lowering neighboring places'' ALCE. Therefore, based
    on the above analysis, we propose the following research hypothesis. Hypothesis
    3 GCRA reduces ALCE and ALCI in neighboring lands through spatial spillovers.
    3. Research design 3.1. The construction of GCRA 3.1.1. Data construction Nagar
    and Schoenfeld (2022) constructed a measure of corporate-level climate risk using
    words such as “weather” from annual reports of publicly traded companies in the
    U.S. Li et al. (2020) similarly constructed corporate-level climate-risk data
    using a set of words including “temperature” based on U.S. company conference-call
    transcripts. Furthermore, Lei et al. (2023) constructed corporate-level climate-risk
    data at the level of Chinese publicly traded companies using a similar lexicon.
    However, existing research has not focused on the significance of GCRA. Noteworthily,
    unlike data at the enterprise level, government work reports, as a summary of
    local governments'' work over a year and plans for future work, encompass information
    about local-development policies and economic- and social-development conditions,
    and they contain information that cannot be captured in enterprises'' annual reports.
    To gain insights into the dynamics of China''s response to climate change and
    the level of GCRA, it is essential to conduct in-depth and detailed research on
    China''s local-government work reports (Hsu et al., 2019). Word2Vec, introduced
    by Mikolov et al. (2013), is a machine-learning technique that is a shallow neural-network
    model for the unsupervised learning of semantic knowledge, which is a recent milestone
    breakthrough in the field of natural-language processing (NLP) (LeCun et al.,
    2015). Specifically, the process of constructing the GCRA indicator is described
    below: First, the text of government work reports from 2011 to 2021 is obtained
    from the government websites of 296 prefecture-level cities in China using crawler
    technology, and the text content is cleaned as follows: (1) As the content of
    Chinese government work reports primarily focuses on domestic issues in China,
    only the Chinese text content is retained. (2) Because tables in the text-conversion
    process would be converted into text boxes and provide no incremental information,
    we remove all tables through text recognition. (3) Due to the characteristics
    of the Chinese language, tokenization is required. Therefore, we use the NLP-analysis
    software package, Jiba, for Chinese tokenization and to remove stop words from
    the text of the government work reports to transform unstructured Chinese text
    data into word-vector models for storage. Second, drawing inspiration from a series
    of studies constructing indicators and their word sets (Lei et al., 2023; Li et
    al., 2020; Nagar and Schoenfeld, 2022; Sautner et al., 2023), we reviewed a corpus
    of 300 government work reports to obtain the characteristics of the textual information.
    We created a seed-word set related to GCRA in the government work reports. The
    specific seed-word set is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Seed words. Seed words Drought,
    Typhoon, Rainstorm, Extreme weather, Climate change, Extreme weather, Flood and
    water-logging, Atmospheric environment, Flood control works, Climate, Low temperature,
    Drought disaster, Water level, Hydro meteorology, Hurricane, Hail, Strong wind,
    Sea level, Climate warming Third, for the same concept or object, speakers often
    use multiple, semantically similar words to describe it; thus, it is necessary
    to enlarge the seed-word set based on word-vector similarity. Therefore, based
    on the identified seed words and to further uncover unique information in government
    work reports in order to comprehensively understand the extent of GCRA, we further
    expanded the seed-word set using the Word2Vec method in machine learning. Essentially,
    Word2Vec utilizes an “embedding” method to transform words into multi-dimensional
    vectors based on contextual semantic information, and it calculates the semantic
    similarity between words by computing the similarity between vectors, thereby
    achieving the goal of expanding the vocabulary. In this study, we use the continuous
    bag-of-words (CBOW) model in Word2Vec to train the corpus of the Chinese government
    work reports. The CBOW model is as follows: (1) where C represents the corpus;
    W represents the center word; and Context represents the context of the center
    word. The fundamental idea of the CBOW model is to predict the probability of
    the current word based on the context, and the Word2Vec word vector corresponding
    to the central word is obtained by maximizing Function (1). Having obtained the
    corresponding word vectors, we calculate vector similarity to obtain the words
    most similar to the center word, thus obtaining the final word set. The specific
    training process is illustrated in Fig. 2. Because the Word2Vec model is trained
    based on numerous government working-report texts, the recommended similar words
    are more suitable for the context of the GCRA level, which can effectively avoid
    the subjectivity of the manually defined word sets and weak relevance of generic
    synonym tools. Download : Download high-res image (423KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. The training process of Word2Vec. Fourth, having compared
    the expansion results with the content in the government work-report texts and
    made a comprehensive judgment, we expanded 62 words for measuring the degree of
    GCRA, as shown in Table 2. Subsequently, we used the dictionary method to compute
    the word frequency of GCRA in government work reports and divided it by the text
    length, and we expressed it in logarithmic form and used it as an indicator of
    GCRA. The larger the indicator, the greater the government''s concern for climate
    risk. Fig. 3 displays the word-cloud map of the used dictionary, illustrating
    that the word set constructed in this study is well-represented in government
    work-report texts. Table 2. Extended word result. Extended word set Flood control

    full-size image Fig. 3. The word cloud of GCRA. 3.1.2. Characteristic analysis
    of GCRA, ALCE, and ALCI Fig. 4 illustrates the ALCE trend from 2011 to 2021. Overall,
    ALCE showed an increasing trend from 2011 to 2015, achieving a peak of 1.685 million
    tons in 2015, while the overall carbon emissions showed a decreasing trend after
    2016. From the perspective of the decomposition of ALCE, fertilizers produce the
    most carbon emissions, while tillage contributes the least carbon emissions, and
    all these components also show an overall decreasing trend. Fig. 5 displays the
    trends of the mean values of GCRA, ALCE, and ALCI. Evidently, the mean value of
    GCRA shows a year-by-year increase, while those of ALCE and ALCI demonstrate a
    year-by-year decrease. These preliminary trends provide evidence that GCRA has
    an inhibitory effect on ALCE and ALCI. Download : Download high-res image (398KB)

    pointed out that when conducting economic textual analysis, if sentence order
    was not crucial, achieving accuracy in analysis could be accomplished through
    word counts alone. Loughran and McDonald (2016) and Hoberg and Maksimovic (2015)
    further state that for the research of text, the dictionary method enhances the
    generalizability and replicability of a study. Moreover, these algorithms are
    highly sensitive to the training dataset, making them susceptible to overfitting
    issues (artificial intelligence faces a reproducibility crisis). The machine-learning
    and textual-analysis methods employed in this study circumvent these complex factors
    and capture the widest range of the extreme weather events caused by climate change,
    allowing for an effective characterization of GCRA. Therefore, this section validates
    the plausibility of the GCRA data. 3.2.1. DID method Because the indicator we
    are measuring essentially represents the GCRA level, it captures the climate risks
    (such as extreme weather events) that regions face due to climate change, to some
    extent. Therefore, when actual climate risks occur, the GCRA indicators should
    also change accordingly. Based hereon, we selected two severe climate-risk events
    for testing, using data released by the China Meteorological Administration. In
    2013, Typhoon Fit made landfall in China and severely impacted several Chinese
    provinces. In 2015, China''s Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces experienced
    a catastrophic flood disaster that resulted in significant losses. Therefore,
    to demonstrate that the increase in indicators is due to climate risk and not
    to other factors, drawing on research by Nagar and Schoenfeld (2022), we used
    a year-city fixed-effects model to perform a DID test on the word frequency for
    GCRA. The results are shown in Fig. 6. It can be observed that for these two severe
    meteorological disasters, the GCRA level significantly increases in the year of
    the events and subsequent years. This demonstrates that changes in GCRA are a
    result of the impact of climate change. Download : Download high-res image (241KB)

    First, this study analyzes the results of word-frequency statistics. Fig. 7 displays
    the 10 most frequently appearing words in the GCRA word set, which are similar
    to the high-frequency words in Lei et al. (2023) and Sautner et al. (2023), which
    indicates that the indicator does indeed capture the extent of GCRA. Download

    Top 10 word frequencies. Second, this study compares the word frequency for GCRA
    with the precipitation and temperature data published by the China Meteorological
    Administration in 2014 and 2016. The table in Fig. 8 lists the five provinces
    with the highest percentage of word frequencies in 2014, and it also shows that
    these top five provinces have more precipitation, which maintains almost the same
    trend as the GCRA word frequencies. Fig. 9 shows the temperature and word frequency
    data for China in 2016. Again, the high and low word frequencies and temperatures
    maintain almost the same trends, further demonstrating the rationality of the
    GCRA indicator constructed in this study. Download : Download high-res image (934KB)

    GCRA on ALCE, building on a study by Liu et al. (2023a), we explore the effect
    of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI from an urban perspective by utilizing the panel data
    of the 296 prefectural-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021. The econometric
    model is set as follows: (2) In this model, Yit is the dependent variable, characterized
    by ALCE (lnCO2) and ALCI (lnPCO2) in year t of the ith city, respectively. lnClmit
    is the independent variable, representing GCRA (lnClm). β1 measures the effect
    of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI. If the coefficient of β1 is significant and negative
    after controlling for the impacts of a range of factors on ALCE and ALCI, it indicates
    an inhibitory effect of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI. Conversely, a positive coefficient
    would indicate a promoting effect. Xit refers to a collection of control variables.
    ui represents area-fixed effects, σi represents time-fixed effects, and εi represents
    the random error term. 3.4. Variable definition and data introduction 3.4.1. Dependent
    variable ALCE and ALCI. Based on findings by West and Marland (2002), we calculate
    ALCE data using the following formula: (3) In Equation (3), E is the total ALCE.
    Ei represents the carbon emissions from six ALCE sources in each prefecture-level
    city: fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, agricultural irrigation, and
    agricultural tilling. δi are the carbon-emission coefficients of the six carbon-emission
    sources: 0.8956 kg kg−1, 4.9341 kg kg−1, 5.18 kg kg−1, 0.5927 kg kg−1, 20.476
    kg hm−2, and 312.6 kg hm−2, respectively. Based on a study by Liu et al. (2023b),
    the ratio of ALCE to the gross domestic product (GDP) at the prefecture-level
    cities is used to measure ALCI. The data are sourced from the China Statistical
    Yearbook and China Agricultural Statistical Yearbook. 3.4.2. Independent variable
    GCRA is calculated using the following formula: (4) In Equation (4), lnClmit represents
    government climate-risk awareness, freqit represents the word frequency, and lengthit
    represents the length of the government work-report text. The data are obtained
    from the government websites of various Chinese prefecture-level cities where
    government work reports are published annually. 3.4.3. Control variable We control
    for the following potential factors that may affect regional ALCE and ALCI: (1)
    level of regional economic development (lnGPD), expressed in logarithmic form
    using real regional gross domestic product per capita (Wang et al., 2023b); (2)
    regional population density (lnPop), which is represented by the number of people
    per square kilometer, expressed in logarithm form (Lin et al., 2023a; H. Wang
    et al., 2023c); (3) regional technological level (lnTec), which is measured using
    regional total factor productivity (Hu et al., 2023); (4) agricultural-land area
    (lnArg), which is calculated as the logarithm of the regional arable-land area
    (Zhang et al., 2023); (5) regional financial-development level (lnFina), which
    is represented by the logarithm of regional deposit and loan balances (Liu et
    al., 2023a; Tong et al., 2024); and (6) regional innovation level (lnRd), which
    is measured using the logarithm of regional research and development (R&D) expenditure
    (Lin et al., 2023b). The control-variable data are all from the China City Statistical
    Yearbook. The descriptive statistics for each variable are shown in Table 3. Table

    analysis Based on Model 2, we use a two-way fixed-effects model and additional
    controls for city- and time-fixed effects and cluster robust standard errors in
    the province-year dimension to test for the effect of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI. The
    baseline regression results are presented in Table 4. When control variables are
    not included, the coefficients of lnClm are −0.012 and −0.144 in Columns (1) and
    (2), respectively, and they are statistically significant at the 1% level, which
    preliminarily confirms the reasonableness of Hypothesis 1. After incorporating
    control variables, as shown in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 4, the coefficients
    of lnClm are −0.010 and −0.121, respectively, which are also significant and negative
    at the 1% level. Specifically, for every 1% increase in GCRA, regional ALCE and
    ALCI will be reduced by an average of 1% and 12.1%, respectively. Supporting Hypothesis
    1, increased GCRA can help promote a reduction in ALCE and ALCI. Table 4. Baseline

    levels, respectively. 4.2. Robustness tests To further demonstrate the reliability
    of the conclusions, we conduct robustness tests on the baseline regression results
    through six different methods: replacement of the dependent variable; replacement
    of the independent variable; lagged-variable analysis; endogeneity test; controlling
    for time trends; and eliminating relevant policy interference. 4.2.1. Replacement
    of the dependent variable Per capita ALCE and ALCI can also reflect the carbon
    emissions of regional agricultural land (Johnson et al., 2007). Therefore, this
    study adopts ALCE and ALCI divided by the total population of prefecture-level
    cities and expressed in logarithm form as alternative indicators of ALCE and ALCI,
    which are denoted as RlnCO2 and RlnPCO2, respectively. The regression outcomes,
    with the dependent variable substituted, are displayed in the first and second
    columns of Table 5. In particular, the coefficients of lnClm are −0.149 and −0.281,
    respectively, and both are significant at the 1% level, demonstrating that even
    after replacing the dependent variable, GCRA has an inhibitory effect on ALCE
    and ALCI, thus further substantiating the robustness of Hypothesis 1. Table 5.

    *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively.
    4.2.2. Replacement of independent variable To further validate the reasonableness
    of the baseline regression results, we utilize the word frequency for GCRA as
    a replacement indicator for measuring GCRA, denoted by lnFclm. Columns (3) and
    (4) of Table 5 present the regression results, where the coefficients of lnFclm
    are −0.005 and −0.070, respectively, and both are significant at the 1% level;
    this suggests that GCRA helps to promote the reduction of ALCE and ALCI, which
    again validates the robustness of the baseline regression. 4.2.3. Lagged-variable
    analysis GCRA is a gradual process, and its impact on ALCE and ALCI may exhibit
    some lag. To examine whether the lagged impact of GCRA exists and to simultaneously
    rule out the possibility of reverse causality between GCRA and ALCE and ALCI,
    we use a one-period lag of government climate-risk concern as an independent variable
    for testing. As indicated in Columns (5) and (6) in Table 5, the coefficient of
    lnClm remains negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that GCRA not
    only helps to suppress current ALCE and ALCI but also helps to promote their future
    reduction, which validates the strength and stability of the baseline results.
    4.2.4. Endogeneity test ALCE, as an important contributor to global climate change,
    exacerbate climate-change risks worldwide. Moreover, the rising climate-change
    risks may affect GCRA, potentially introducing endogeneity issues and reverse
    causality between ALCE and GCRA. Thus, to alleviate potential endogeneity issues,
    we adopt an instrumental-variable (IV) approach for estimation. Related studies
    have indicated that the establishment of local meteorological monitoring stations
    directly impacts GCRA, i.e., the more meteorological monitoring stations in a
    region, the higher the local GCRA (Wei et al., 2021). However, no direct relationship
    exists between ALCE and the establishment of meteorological monitoring stations,
    and the latter does not significantly change regional ALCE. Therefore, in this
    study, the logarithm of the number of regional national meteorological monitoring
    stations is selected as an IV for GCRA and is tested using two-stage least squares
    (2SLS) regression. Table 6 shows the results of the 2SLS test, where Columns (1)
    and (3) show the results of the first stage. The results indicate that the F-values
    for the first-stage are 4185.03 and 3585.25, signifying a significant correlation
    between the IV and the endogenous explanatory variables, without the presence
    of weak-instrument problems. Columns (2) and (4) present the results of the second-stage
    regression, which show that the coefficient of GCRA estimated using the IV is
    always negative and significant at least at the 5% level, regardless of whether
    the dependent variable is ALCE or ALCI. This shows that after considering possible
    endogeneity issues, GCRA still contributes to promote emission and carbon reduction
    on agricultural land, validating the robustness of the baseline regression results.

    1% significance levels, respectively. 4.2.5. Controlling time trend Given other
    ALCE and ALCI factors, such as time trends in control variables that may vary
    between regions with high GCRA and those with low GCRA, these could potentially
    introduce interference in the empirical results. Therefore, we control for the
    time trends of ALCE and ALCI factors by constructing third-order polynomial terms
    for control variables and time as well as interaction terms between control variables
    and time-dummy variables; these two types of interaction terms are added into
    the baseline model to control for the time trend of the many factors in ALCE and
    ALCI, respectively. The specific models are constructed as follows: (5) (6) In
    Models (5) and (6), f(T) denotes a third-order polynomial time trend, which is
    represented by the time trends of the 1st to third orders, and σt represents time-dummy
    variables. f(T) and σt are multiplied by the control variables to control for
    the time trend of the control variables, while the other variables are set as
    in Model (2). The regression results when controlling for the time trends affecting
    ALCE and ALCI are shown in Table 7. The results show that the coefficients of
    GCRA are all negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that higher
    GCRA can significantly suppress ALCE and ALCI, further validating the robustness
    of the baseline results. Table 7. Controlling time trend. Variable (1) (2) (3)

    4.2.6. Excluding relevant policy interference To proactively address the escalating
    global climate issues and attain the targets of “peak carbon” and “carbon neutrality,”
    the Chinese government has initiated and implemented a series of environmental
    protection policies. These policies include the low-carbon city pilot policy (Yu
    and Zhang, 2021), smart-city construction pilot policy (Guo and Zhong, 2022),
    ecological-civilization demonstration zones (Wang et al., 2021), energy-quota
    trading system (Du et al., 2023a) and new-urbanization pilot policy (Peng et al.,
    2021). These policies aim to promote emissions and carbon reduction, thereby slowing
    down the process of global climate change. Therefore, to eliminate potential interference
    from the five policies mentioned above, we separately exclude the observations
    relating to the implementation of the pilot policies mentioned above and reperform
    the empirical test, and the regression results are shown in Fig. 10. After systematically
    eliminating interference from the relevant policies in turns, GCRA still significantly
    mitigates ALCE and ALCI, demonstrating once again that GCRA helps to promote ALCE
    reduction. Download : Download high-res image (507KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Excluding relevant policy interference. 5. Mechanism analysis The
    baseline regression results indicate that GCRA significantly inhibits regional
    ALCE and ALCI. This study further investigates the mechanisms through which GCRA
    influences regional ALCE and ALCI. We construct a mechanism-test model to empirically
    examine the validity of Hypothesis 2. The specific model is as follows: (7) In
    Model (7), mechanismit denotes the mechanism variables, which are government environmental-regulation
    strength (lnER), regional agricultural-mechanization level (lnMec), and agricultural
    green-technology innovation (lnGreen). The rest of the variables are consistent
    with those in the baseline model. 5.1. Environmental regulation Environmental
    regulation is a crucial requirement and precondition for achieving the transformation
    to low-carbon agricultural-land use. The government''s efforts to strengthen environmental
    regulations play a crucial role in promoting emissions and carbon reduction in
    agricultural land, thus contributing to sustainable agricultural development (Ahmed
    et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). This section empirically tests whether GCRA enhances
    the ability of regional governments to increase environmental regulation, which
    in turn promotes regional ALCE and ALCI reductions (Wang et al., 2023b). The regression
    results, as shown in the first column of Table 8, indicate that the coefficient
    of lnClm is 0.442, and it is positive and significant at the 1% level, thus supporting
    Hypothesis 2. This suggests that when GCRA increases, regional governments also
    enhance their environmental regulations, thereby advancing carbon-emissions mitigation
    and diminishing carbon intensity in regional agricultural land. Table 8. Mechanism

    deviations, *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance
    levels, respectively. 5.2. Regional agricultural-mechanization level The mechanization
    of agricultural land facilitates the optimization of agricultural-production resource
    allocation. Additionally, the scale effect of agricultural-land mechanization
    aids in mitigating the carbon-increasing effects caused by distortions in the
    allocation of agricultural land and labor resources, thereby reducing regional
    agricultural carbon-emissions intensity (Qiu et al., 2021; Takeshima, 2018). Therefore,
    we utilize the total power consumed by regional agricultural machinery to measure
    the level of mechanization of agricultural land as a means to test the mechanism
    of the impact of GCRA on ALCE. The regression results are exhibited in the second
    column of Table 8; the coefficient of lnClm is 0.117, which is positive and significant
    at the 1% level; this indicates that when GCRA is elevated, the government will
    increase its efforts to promote the level of mechanization of agricultural land,
    give play to the carbon-reducing effect of the mechanization of agricultural land,
    and boost the development of regional agricultural-land decarbonization. Hypothesis
    2 is supported. 5.3. Agricultural green-technology innovation Green-technology
    innovation exerts a crucial influence in empowering carbon-emission source control
    and end-of-pipe governance. It serves as an effective means to mitigate GHG emissions.
    Agricultural green-technology innovation is an essential prerequisite for facilitating
    carbon mitigation and reducing carbon-emissions intensity in agricultural land.
    Therefore, we utilize agricultural green-patent data to measure regional agricultural
    green-technology innovation. The patent data are from the IncoPat database. Specifically,
    we collected patent-information data from within China, which includes applicant
    addresses and IPC-classification codes. By using applicant addresses, corresponding
    geographic locations were obtained, resulting in prefecture-level city data. In
    addition, we adopt the World Intellectual Property Organization''s IPC green inventory
    in the agriculture forestry patent IPC classification number to determine the
    scope of recognition of agricultural green patents. If a patent classification
    number belongs to the agriculture forestry patent IPC classification, it is recognized
    as an agriculture green patent; otherwise, it is a non-agriculture green patent.
    Furthermore, the number of agricultural green patents was aggregated at the prefecture-level
    city level, ultimately yielding the regional agricultural green-technology innovation
    indicator. The regression results are shown in the third column of Table 8. The
    regression coefficient of lnClm is 0.291, which is positive and significant at
    the 1% level. This indicates that GCRA significantly influences agricultural green-technology
    innovation. With increased GCRA, regional governments are more likely to intensify
    their support for agricultural green-technology innovation, leading to higher
    outputs and applications of agricultural green-technology innovation and ultimately
    facilitating carbon mitigation and reducing carbon-emissions intensity in agricultural
    land. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is supported. 6. Further analysis 6.1. Heterogeneity
    analysis 6.1.1. Regional heterogeneity While GCRA has a significant negative effect
    on ALCE and ALCI, does this effect vary by geographic location? To address this
    question, we divide the sample into eastern, central, and western geographical
    regions to examine the regional heterogeneity of the impact of GCRA on ALCE and
    ALCI. In Table 9, Columns (1) and (4) present the results for the eastern region,
    where the coefficient of lnClm is negative and significant at the 1% level, demonstrating
    that GCRA in the eastern region contributes to a significant reduction in ALCE
    and ALCI. Conversely, within the central and western regions, the coefficients
    of lnClm are not statistically significant. First, in contrast to the central
    and western regions, the eastern region exhibits a superior level of economic
    advancement and a more advanced climate-observation infrastructure. Additionally,
    the eastern region is prone to heavy rainfall and faces higher climate risks.
    Therefore, the government in the eastern region exhibits greater climate-risk
    attention and is more inclined to take action to reduce ALCE and ALCI. Consequently,
    the eastern region experiences a more pronounced effect in reducing ALCE and ALCI.
    Second, the central and western regions have larger-scale agricultural land, which
    has a certain degree of weakening effect on GCRA, thus making the effect of GCRA
    on ALCE and ALCI there nonsignificant. Table 9. Regional heterogeneity. Variable

    1% significance levels, respectively. 6.1.2. Climatic condition heterogeneity
    China''s arid and humid climatic zones are more prone to the extreme weather events
    caused by climate change (Jiang et al., 2015). Therefore, we further explore whether
    there is heterogeneity in the impact of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI based on climatic
    conditions. If agricultural land is located in arid or humid climatic regions,
    it is assigned a value of 1; otherwise, it is assigned a value of 0. We then conducted
    subgroup analysis based on this classification. Table 10 displays the outcomes
    of the climatic-condition heterogeneity test. Columns (1) and (2) show the regression
    outcomes for arid and humid climatic zones, where the regression coefficient of
    GCRA is negative and significant. The regression coefficients are nonsignificant
    in Columns (3) and (4), corresponding to other climatic regions. This indicates
    that higher GCRA is more effective in reducing ALCE and ALCI in arid and humid
    climatic regions, which are more prone to climate change. Table 10. Climatic condition

    at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. 6.1.3. Heterogeneity
    in grain-producing regions ALCE and ALCI are significantly influenced by food-production
    zones, where substantial differences in agricultural-land structure and production
    methods exist between major grain-producing regions and other areas, leading to
    variations in ALCE and ALCI (Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, we divide the sample
    based on whether an observation pertains to a major grain-producing region and
    conduct tests for heterogeneity in grain-producing regions. From Table 11, the
    coefficient of lnClm is negative and significant in other non-grain producing
    regions, indicating that GCRA contributes to the advancement of carbon-emission
    mitigation and decrease in ALCI. In major grain-producing areas, the impact of
    GCRA on ALCE and ALCI is nonsignificant. This may be due to the higher proportion
    of crop cultivation in major grain-producing areas, leading to increased ALCE.
    Additionally, the crucial role of major grain-producing areas in ensuring national
    food security somewhat weakens the inhibitory effect of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI.

    6.2. Analysis of spatial-spillover effects Given the wide range of climate-change
    impacts and synergistic relationship between governments responding to climate
    change, we further examine whether GCRA has spatial-spillover effects on ALCE
    and ALCI in neighboring lands. Initially, an anti-distance matrix is formulated,
    and it is subsequently integrated into the model to derive the precise spatial-weight
    matrix, which is constructed as follows: (8) In Model (8), dij represents the
    actual distance between City i and City j, with Wij being 0 when i equals j. As
    this section shifts the research focus to the spatial-spillover effects of GCRA
    on regional ALCE and ALCI, spatial-lag (SLM) and spatial Durbin (SDM) models are
    employed for testing. To satisfy the identification preconditions for the model,
    we initially used Moran''s I index to test the pertinence of ALCE and ALCI between
    various regions. The mathematical representation of Moran''s I is as follows:
    (9) In Equation (9), n = 296 represents the 296 cities used in this study, and
    xi and xj respectively signify the GDP of the ith and jth prefecture-level cities.
    Additionally, ‾x represents the mean value of x for the 296 prefecture-level cities,
    and wij signifies the spatial weight within the spatial-weight matrix. From Table
    12, a significant and positive spatial correlation can be observed between regional
    ALCE and ALCI during the sample period from 2011 to 2021. Therefore, to further
    investigate the impact of GCRA on regional ALCE and ALCI, spatial econometric
    models should be chosen for further analysis (Anselin, 2001). Table 12. Global

    *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively.
    To further verify the reliability of the spatial-spillover effects of GCRA on
    regional ALCE and ALCI, we construct SLM and SDM models for empirical testing.
    The detailed model structures are presented as follows: SLM: (10) SDM: (11) In
    Models (10) and (11), Wij represents the spatial-weight matrix, ρ and γ are the
    coefficients of the spatial-lag terms, while the other variables remain consistent
    with those in the baseline model. The results of the spatial-effects regression
    are shown in Table 13. The coefficient of Main-lnClm is negative and significant
    at the 1% level for both SLM and SDM. Furthermore, the coefficients of W-lnClm
    are −0.160 and −1.620, respectively, and are significant at the 1% level. This
    indicates that GCRA exerts a substantial suppressive impact on carbon emissions
    and intensity in adjacent agricultural-land areas. In other words, when the government
    becomes aware of potential climate risks, it not only takes measures to reduce
    carbon emissions and intensity in its own region but also engages in cooperative
    governance with neighboring governments to promote carbon reduction in agricultural
    land. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 is supported. Table 13. Spatial effect analysis

    et al. (2022)''s research, we further explore the impact of GCRA on ALCE from
    different quantile perspectives using quantile regression. The results of the
    quantile regression are shown in the following figures. Fig. 11 displays the impact
    of GCRA on ALCE at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles, while Fig.
    12 shows the impact of GCRA on ALCI at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles.
    Evidently, the negative effect of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI increases with an increase
    in GCRA quartile, and all of them are significant above the 25% quartile. This
    result indicates a strong negative correlation between GCRA and ALCE and ALCI.
    The higher the GCRA, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect on ALCE and ALCI.

    and policy implications GHG emissions are causing increasingly severe global climate
    warming, and agricultural land, the second-largest source of GHG emissions, should
    be given due attention. The government, as the guardian of regional sustainable
    development, plays an irreplaceable role in addressing climate risks and promoting
    carbon and emissions reduction in agricultural land. However, in the process of
    achieving China''s strategic goals of “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality,”
    the importance of government climate-risk awareness in mitigating climate change
    and promoting sustainable development, as well as its role in this process, are
    questions that the academic community must urgently explore. Based hereon, we
    utilize the text data of the government work reports from 2011 to 2021 and construct
    an indicator of GCRA using the Word2Vec model in machine learning and text analysis;
    we then empirically explore the relationship between GCRA and ALCE and ALCI using
    a two-way fixed-effects model with ALCE and ALCI as the entry point. The research
    results indicate the following: (1) GCRA contributes to advancing carbon mitigation
    and reducing carbon intensity within agricultural land. This conclusion retains
    its validity even following a battery of rigorous tests for robustness, such as
    the replacement of the dependent variable, replacement of the independent variable,
    lagged-variable analysis, an endogeneity test, controlling for time trends, and
    eliminating relevant policy interference. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that
    GCRA primarily promotes ALCE and ALCI reduction by strengthening environmental
    regulation, promoting agricultural green-technology innovation, and upgrading
    agricultural-land mechanization. (3) Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that
    in the eastern regions, arid and humid climate zones, and non-grain-producing
    areas, GCRA has a more significant effect on carbon and carbon-intensity reduction
    in agricultural land. (4) Spatial-spillover analysis and quantile tests indicate
    that GCRA also has a significant inhibitory effect on neighboring ALCE and ALCI.
    Moreover, the higher the GCRA, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect. Based
    on the above findings, we offer the following policy recommendations: First, the
    government should continue to enhance its climate-change monitoring efforts, increase
    its focus on climate-change risks, and improve its capacity to adapt to climate
    change. It should consistently intensify its efforts to address climate change,
    actively build a fair, equitable, and cooperative global climate-governance system,
    and provide valuable lessons for climate governance in developing countries. Second,
    the government should continue to advance efforts to reduce emissions and sequester
    carbon in agricultural land. This can be achieved by strengthening environmental
    regulations, implementing stricter emission standards for agricultural land, and
    enhancing monitoring indicators for emissions reduction and carbon sequestration
    in agricultural land. Furthermore, increased technological support is crucial
    for developing green technologies that reduce emissions and sequester carbon in
    agricultural land, thereby improving the overall technological framework for emissions
    reduction and carbon sequestration. Additionally, there should be an accelerated
    promotion of advanced and applicable low-carbon, energy-efficient, agricultural-mechanization
    equipment. The widespread adoption of new-energy technologies can enhance the
    mechanization levels in agricultural land, which in turn can contribute to increasing
    the climate resilience of agricultural land and fostering sustainable development.
    Third, first, the central and western regions should accelerate the construction
    of infrastructure to cope with climate change, strengthen the cultivation of green
    industries in the western region, and vigorously develop green land-use patterns
    that are green, low-carbon, and eco-cyclical. Simultaneously, the government should
    attach importance to the dissemination of agricultural-production technologies,
    promote the transfer of the advanced agricultural technologies in the eastern
    region to the central and western regions, promote the in-depth integration of
    green technologies and agricultural land, and improve the level of decarbonization
    of agricultural land. This would contribute to the fight against global climate
    change and promotion of sustainable development. Second, the monitoring of early
    warning and management of climate-change risks in arid and humid climatic zones
    should continue to be strengthened, and the government should continue to increase
    the level of attention paid to climate risks and focus on promoting ALCE reduction.
    Finally, regional governments should emphasize the reduction of emissions and
    carbon emissions in major food-producing areas, comprehensively enhance the production
    capacity of agricultural land, reduce the intensity of GHG emissions, and improve
    the ability of the region to cope with climate-change risk. Fourth, it is essential
    to further leverage collaborative governance among regional governments. Given
    that different local governments may have distinct climate policies, it is crucial
    for them to actively cooperate in addressing the adverse impacts of climate change.
    They should establish a joint prevention-and-control mechanism for climate risks
    and work together through complementary advantages to promote the low-carbon development
    of agricultural land. Thus, they can positively contribute to mitigating global
    climate change and its associated effects. In addition, this study explores the
    dampening effect of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI, providing both theoretical and empirical
    evidence, albeit with some limitations. First, at the level of mechanism analysis,
    there may be alternative pathways of the influence of GCRA on ALCE. Second, the
    analysis of the heterogeneity of ALCE can be further extended. In response to
    the above issues, it is necessary to continuously track the frontiers of practice
    in future to supplement and improve the findings in order to enrich the theoretical
    and practical depth of this study. CRediT authorship contribution statement Minghao

    Description The implementation of image processing and computer vision methods
    can serve as an alternative approach to accelerate the process of identifying
    or classifying plants. The dataset consists of a total of 14094 images, distributed
    across categories as shown in the Table 1. Table 1. Distribution of Thai cannabis
    plant images. The dataset comprises a collection of 14094 images, categorizing
    eight distinct Thai cannabis classes: Foi Thong, Hang Kra Rog Phan ST1, Hang Suea
    Sakonnakhon TT1, KD KT, Kroeng Krawia, Purple Huai Khrai, Tanao Si Kan Khaw WA1,
    and Tanao Si Kan Dang RD1. This diverse collection includes both dried and healthy
    specimens, offering researchers a comprehensive dataset for various research areas,
    including botanical exploration, machine learning, medicinal plant studies, education,
    and cross-disciplinary research initiatives. Each category is organized within
    distinct folders, ensuring straightforward access and identification of specific
    samples. Refer to Fig. 2 for sample images of cannabis plant varieties included
    in the dataset. 3. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 3.1. Experimental
    Design The dataset images were captured using the Iphone 13 pro mobile phone,
    ensuring consistent image quality and resolution for each plant sample. Fig. 2
    shows the experimental setup for dataset creation. The dataset encompasses eight
    categories, introducing variability in lighting and environmental factors to mimic
    real-world scenarios. Fig. 3 shows experimental configuration setup for the Thai
    Cannabis Plant dataset. Fig. 4 shows data acquisition process and Fig. 5 illustrates
    pre-processed image. Step 1: Image Capture (September 2023) - In this step, we
    conducted field visits during both daytime and nighttime to capture images related
    to various conditions. The primary objective was to compile a comprehensive collection
    of images relevant to Thai Cannabis plant categories. Step 2: Image Pre-processing
    (January 2024) - During this step, we enhanced the quality of Thai Cannabis plant
    images by resizing them to 1024 × 768 using FastStone Photo Resizer. The data
    acquisition process involved capturing images during field visits and subsequently
    preparing them through pre-processing for inclusion in the dataset. 3.2. Materials
    or Specification of Image Acquisition System The mobile phone (Iphone 13 pro used
    in the data acquisition process and the specifications of the captured images
    are: Sensor Type: 64 MP GW1 / S5KGW3 Focal Length: 26mm Aperture Range: f/1.79-f/2.2
    Aspect Ratio: 4:3 The images taken were saved in JPG format and were resized to
    a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels using FastStone Photo Resizer. These specifications
    provide crucial details about the cameras used and the image properties obtained
    during the data acquisition process. 3.3. Preprocessing Method In our study, we
    initiated image preprocessing using FastStone Photo Resizer, a versatile tool
    widely known for batch image resizing. This step, outlined in Fig. 6, streamlines
    the resizing process for image batches, proving valuable for preprocessing in
    diverse research applications, such as image-based machine learning, analysis,
    and data augmentation. For subsequent preprocessing, we adopted the ''preprocess_input''
    function within the Keras library, tailored for pre-trained models. This built-in
    function encompasses mean subtraction, channel reordering, scaling, and resizing,
    ensuring proper formatting of images for pre-trained models. Its role is crucial
    in guaranteeing that input images align with the specific requirements of the
    chosen pre-trained model. Fig. 7 shows the augmentation code of Thai cannabis
    dataset and Fig. 8 represents image enhancement steps during preprocessing. 3.4.
    Demonstrating the Significance of the Thai Cannabis Plant Dataset In the realm
    of machine learning datasets, several notable contributions have emerged recently
    [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8],10] catering to machine learning applications.
    We wanted to show just how valuable our Thai Cannabis Plant Dataset [1,9] is,
    so we ran some experiments using well-known pre-trained models like VGG19, DenseNet201,
    and EfficientNetB7. Our goal was to see how this dataset can boost the accuracy
    of machine learning models, especially when it comes to identifying Thai Cannabis
    plants. First, we ran these pre-trained models without any tweaks using our dataset
    as a sort of benchmark. Then, we gave these models a boost by training them on
    our dataset. What we found was pretty exciting. When we fine-tuned these models
    with our dataset, there was a significant jump in accuracy. This was most apparent
    in how well the models could detect and classify Thai cannabis plants. Table 2
    shows accuracy of pretrained machine learning models on the Thai cannabis plant
    dataset before and after training with our dataset. Similarly, Table 3 shows confusion
    matrix of pretrained machine learning models on the Thai cannabis plant dataset
    before and after training with our dataset. Table 2. Accuracy of pretrained machine
    learning models on the Thai cannabis plant dataset: before and after training.
    Machine Learning Model Accuracy (Before Training on our Dataset) Accuracy (After
    Training on our Dataset) VGG19 18.21% 99.67% DenseNet201 9.92% 99.67% EfficientNetB7
    6.83% 99.67% Table 3. Confusion Matrix of pretrained models. In a nutshell, our
    dataset plays a crucial role in making these machine learning models, like VGG19,
    DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB7, perform much better. By offering a solid resource
    for training and fine-tuning, our dataset becomes a vital tool in creating more
    reliable models that can help improve Thai Cannabis Plant cultivation and keep
    those plants healthy (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (241KB) Download

    steps. The above confusion matrix in the Table 3, offers a detailed breakdown
    of the model''s predictive accuracy. It allows us to discern where the model excels,
    correctly identifying instances within each class (true positives), and where
    it stumbles, making classification errors (predicted positives and predicted negatives).
    Limitations Expanding the dataset to encompass a wider range of classes and samples
    from diverse global regions would enhance its overall diversity and applicability.

  description: 'Pomegranate fruit disease detection and classification based on computer
    vision remains challenging because of various diseases, building the task of collecting
    or creating datasets is extremely difficult. The usage of machine learning and
    deep learning in farming has increased significantly in recent years. For developing
    precise and consistent machine learning models and reducing misclassification
    in real-time situations, efficient and clean datasets are a key obligation. The
    current pomegranate fruit diseases classification standardized and publicly accessible
    datasets for agriculture are not adequate to train the models efficiently. To
    address this issue, our primary goal of the current study is to create an image
    dataset of pomegranate fruits of numerous diseases that is ready to use and publicly
    available. We have composed 5 types of pomegranate fruit healthy and diseases
    from different places like Ballari, Bengaluru, Bagalakote, Etc. These images were
    taken from July to October 2023. The dataset contains 5099 pomegranate fruit images
    which are labeled and classified into 5 types: Healthy, Bacterial blight, Anthracnose,
    Cercospora fruit spot, and Alternaria fruit spot. The dataset comprises 5 folders
    entitled with corresponding diseases. This dataset might be useful for locating
    pomegranate diseases in other nations as well as increasing the production of
    pomegranate yield. This dataset is extremely useful for researchers of machine
    learning or deep learning in the field of agriculture for emerging computer vision
    applications.'

    fruit disease detection and classification based on computer vision remains challenging
    because of various diseases, building the task of collecting or creating datasets
    is extremely difficult. The usage of machine learning and deep learning in farming
    has increased significantly in recent years. For developing precise and consistent
    machine learning models and reducing misclassification in real-time situations,
    efficient and clean datasets are a key obligation. The current pomegranate fruit
    diseases classification standardized and publicly accessible datasets for agriculture
    are not adequate to train the models efficiently. To address this issue, our primary
    goal of the current study is to create an image dataset of pomegranate fruits
    of numerous diseases that is ready to use and publicly available. We have composed
    5 types of pomegranate fruit healthy and diseases from different places like Ballari,
    Bengaluru, Bagalakote, Etc. These images were taken from July to October 2023.
    The dataset contains 5099 pomegranate fruit images which are labeled and classified
    into 5 types: Healthy, Bacterial blight, Anthracnose, Cercospora fruit spot, and
    Alternaria fruit spot. The dataset comprises 5 folders entitled with corresponding
    diseases. This dataset might be useful for locating pomegranate diseases in other
    nations as well as increasing the production of pomegranate yield. This dataset
    is extremely useful for researchers of machine learning or deep learning in the
    field of agriculture for emerging computer vision applications. Previous article

    and management. 3. Data Description 3.1. Description of major pomegranate fruit
    diseases and symptoms Pomegranate is susceptible to several diseases that can
    adversely affect fruit quality and yield. Various agricultural specialists, horticulturists,
    and pomegranate plantation farmers have independently validated these diseases
    in pomegranate fruit images. 3.1.1. Healthy A healthy pomegranate should feel
    firm and heavy for its size. Gently squeeze it to check for any soft spots or
    mushiness. Avoid fruits that are overly soft or have blemishes. The skin of a
    healthy pomegranate should be vibrant and have a rich, deep color, typically ranging
    from dark red to reddish-purple. However, the exact shade can vary depending on
    the variety. The skin should have a glossy appearance, which indicates that it
    is fresh and well-hydrated. Inspect the skin for any cracks, splits, or punctures.
    A healthy pomegranate should have smooth, unbroken skin, medium to large, and
    feel heavy in your hand compared to its size. Gently tap the pomegranate with
    your knuckles. It should produce a metallic, ringing sound. It should be well-formed
    and not shriveled or moldy. It should have a plump and round appearance, without
    any visible signs of withering or wrinkling. When you hold a pomegranate, it should
    feel evenly weighted, with no hollow or empty-feeling spots inside [10]. The sample
    images of healthy pomegranate fruits taken from the field are presented in Fig.

    Fig. 1. The Healthy pomegranate fruit. 3.1.2. Bacterial blight Bacterial blight
    is a common disease that affects pomegranate trees and their fruits. It can cause
    dark, sunken lesions on the surface of the fruit. These lesions may be circular
    or irregular in shape and are often surrounded by a reddish-brown or dark border.
    Infected fruit may exhibit a sticky exudate that oozes from the lesions. This
    exudate can be translucent or amber-colored. It may develop cracks or fissures
    around the lesions. These cracks can extend deep into the fruit and may promote
    secondary infections by other pathogens. In severe cases, pomegranate fruit affected
    by bacterial blight may prematurely drop from the tree before reaching maturity.
    This can result in significant yield losses. It may show discoloration, often
    with a water-soaked appearance, around the lesions. The color of the affected
    area can range from brown to black [11]. The sample images of Bacterial blight

    The Bacterial blight pomegranate fruit. 3.1.3. Anthracnose Anthracnose disease
    signs on leaves, the calyx region, and fruits, there are tiny, regular to sporadic
    black specks that subsequently evolve into dark brown depressed patches, and infected
    fruit turn yellow. It is a common fungal disease that can affect pomegranate trees
    and their fruits. Anthracnose can cause circular or oval-shaped lesions on the
    surface of the fruit. These lesions may initially appear small and water-soaked,
    but they can enlarge over time. The lesions caused by anthracnose often become
    sunken as they progress. They may have a dark or brown center with a lighter-colored
    margin. Under humid conditions, pinkish or orange-colored spore masses may develop
    within the lesions. These spore masses are a characteristic feature of anthracnose.
    As the disease progresses, the infected fruit may start to rot. The rotting may
    be accompanied by a foul smell. Severe cases of anthracnose can lead to premature
    fruit drop, where the infected fruits fall from the tree before they fully mature
    [13]. The sample images of Anthracnose disease pomegranate fruits taken from the
    field are presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (831KB) Download

    fruit spot Cercospora fruit spot is a fungal disease that affects pomegranate
    fruit. It is caused by the pathogen Cercospora spp. and can lead to significant
    yield losses if not managed properly. The initial symptoms appear as small, circular
    to irregular spots on the fruit surface. These spots are usually brown or dark
    brown. Over time, the lesions tend to enlarge and may merge, forming larger irregular-shaped
    spots. The affected areas may also become sunken or depressed. As the disease
    progresses, the color of the lesions may change to gray or black, with a dark
    brown border. The affected fruit may develop an overall dull appearance. In severe
    cases, the fruit surface may crack or split near the lesions, providing entry
    points for secondary pathogens or decay-causing organisms. Infected fruits may
    prematurely drop from the tree before reaching maturity. This can result in significant
    yield reduction [14]. The sample images of Cercospora fruit spot disease pomegranate

    fruit spot. 3.1.5. Alternaria fruit spot Alternaria fruit spot, caused by the
    fungus Alternaria alternata, is a common disease that affects pomegranate fruit.
    It primarily occurs in warm and humid conditions. The disease initially appears
    as small, brown, or black circular spots on the surface of the fruit. These spots
    may be slightly sunken and have a dark margin. As the disease progresses, the
    spots may enlarge and merge, forming larger irregularly shaped lesions. The affected
    areas may become soft and sunken. The lesions often turn dark brown or black as
    they mature. The center of the lesions may appear dry and corky, while the surrounding
    area remains slightly sunken. Under favourable conditions, the lesions may develop
    a velvety black appearance due to the presence of fungal spores. These spores
    are responsible for the spread of the disease. It''s worth noting that the symptoms
    of Alternaria fruit spot can vary depending on the severity of the infection and
    environmental conditions [12]. The sample images of Alternaria fruit spot disease

    a crucial resource for accurately identifying and managing diseases affecting
    pomegranate fruits, aiding in the development of effective strategies for disease
    control. By providing a comprehensive collection of data, the dataset facilitates
    the development of algorithms for early disease detection, enabling timely intervention
    to mitigate the impact on pomegranate crops [7]. Researchers and practitioners
    in precision agriculture can leverage the dataset to enhance farming practices,
    ensuring targeted and efficient application of resources for disease prevention
    and control. The dataset supports research endeavors, fostering innovation in
    the fields of agriculture, plant pathology, and data science. It provides a foundation
    for exploring new methodologies and techniques. 3.3. Description of dataset folders

    and Methods 4.1. Data gathering India is now one of the world''s top producers
    of pomegranates because of years of considerable development in pomegranate production.
    Pomegranates are grown in several states across the nation, with Karnataka, Gujarat,
    Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh functioning as the top producers. It is feasible
    to identify and categorize pomegranate fruit diseases based on images through
    the application of some computer vision and deep learning algorithms [8]. The
    proposed dataset contains images of various pomegranate fruit diseases gathered
    from various farms. Because these farms are affected by many diseases, we discussed
    with farm owners the issues and it is a major cause of crop failure to overcome
    these issues the study focuses on a specific fruit instead of many. We have collected
    5 types of pomegranate fruit disease images including healthy from different places
    like Ballari, Bengaluru, Bagalakote, Etc. the pomegranate photographs were taken
    with the high-definition camera on the Redmi 9 Phone. The original photos were
    in the JPG file format, 1:1 aspect ratio, and 3120 × 3120 pixel size. These photos
    of pomegranates were taken on a farm in a sunny and cloudy environment from 9
    am to 4 pm. The pictures were shot between July to October of 2023. A total of
    5099 photos were produced after these photographs were then divided into five
    categories: Healthy, Bacterial blight, Anthracnose, Cercospora fruit spot, and
    Alternaria fruit spot. The dataset was divided into five folders that are ideal
    for deep learning model training. The dataset''s folder is 4.18GB in size, and
    a RAR file has been made available for convenient downloading. We have also consulted
    and discussed with ICAR- Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bengaluru,
    to classify the respective images and fruits. The responsibility typically falls
    on a team of experts, including plant pathologists, researchers, and agricultural
    scientists. Their expertise in pomegranate fruit diseases enables us to accurately
    label images based on the observed symptoms and characteristics. A decent and
    sufficient dataset can significantly improve the performance of machine learning
    algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural
    Networks, etc., and deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks,
    Recurrent Neural Networks, etc., hence it is essential for their success. Deep
    learning algorithms excel at learning intricate patterns from data through the
    layers of a neural network. The hidden layers, in particular, act as feature extractors,
    enabling the model to identify and understand complex relationships. When faced
    with new, unseen data, the model can leverage these learned features to recognize
    and categorize unknown events, As a result, there is a strong connection between
    the effectiveness of the machine learning or deep learning system and the dataset''s
    quality. Aspects of the dataset''s quality can be assessed including its size,
    intraclass consistency, interclass disparity, and imbalance in the distribution
    of the data among the many categories [9]. 4.2. Image acquisition unit The dataset
    was composed using a Redmi 9 phone camera with a 13 megapixel primary sensor and
    a 2 megapixel depth camera f/2.2 aperture. The rear camera features a time stamp
    on photos, optical image stabilization, OV13B10 sensor with 1.12µm pixels, autofocus,
    and location information. The photos were taken with 1:1 aspect ratio, high picture
    quality, with different viewpoints hand-held by a person at a height of 100 cm
    -150 cm and a distance of 20 cm - 30 cm from the fruit. A brief description of
    the camera device is shown in Table 1 and the shooting method is shown in Fig.

    connection with image processing of pomegranate fruits. We have searched many
    platforms to find a pomegranate fruit disease dataset but none of the platforms
    have specific pomegranate fruit disease datasets. Because the agriculture industry
    is inherently uncertain, creating datasets in this field is a very difficult undertaking.
    Due to this issue, many authors collected images locally and proceeded with their
    research work. Our future work will be on the pomegranate diseases dataset this
    dataset is extremely supportive for the machine learning or deep learning experts
    working in the field of precision agriculture to develop computer applications
    using machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning algorithms. Table 3.

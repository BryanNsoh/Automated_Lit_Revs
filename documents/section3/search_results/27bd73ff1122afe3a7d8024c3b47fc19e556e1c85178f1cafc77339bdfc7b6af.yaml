    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    the calibration of SIMDualKc for winter wheat in North China plain: (a) simulated
    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    Inner Mongolia, China, comparing a wet and a dry year with focusing on the groundwater
    contribution from a shallow water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results
    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\
    \ decision\nsupport tools are required to help the user decide where to apply\
    \ how much irrigation water at\ndifferent crop growth stages to optimize water\
    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n2 of 21\nefﬁcient management\
    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    \ applied to plant\nstress research in Europe.\nAbstract: In the last few years,\
    \ large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize\nstress detection\
    \ in crop ﬁelds. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become\
    \ an\nessential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable\
    \ indicator of the physiological\nstatus of plants, responding to both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging\nsensors and data-mining\
    \ techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more\nautomatized,\
    \ precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections\n\
    related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct\
    \ interpretation of\nthe data. This review focuses on the state of the art of\
    \ thermography applied to the detection of biotic\nstress. The work will also\
    \ revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements\n\
    as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this\
    \ technique, particularly\nat the ﬁeld scale.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; proximal\
    \ sensing; thermography; plant phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental conditions\
    \ driven by climate change and infections are great challenges\nthat need to be\
    \ overcome by modern agriculture. The economic loss in agriculture caused by\n\
    increasing environmental pressures could reach an annual 0.3% to 0.8% of projected\
    \ global\ngross domestic product by the end of the century [1]. Moreover, plant\
    \ diseases are the main\ncause of the drop in production and economic losses in\
    \ agriculture worldwide, reaching\nyield losses of 20 to 30% depending on the\
    \ crop [2]. Current practices and social activities\n-such as intensiﬁed monoculture\
    \ in large areas, the use of genetically uniform plant varieties\nand the development\
    \ of global supply chains and logistic activities- contribute largely to\nthe\
    \ widespread of plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution [3].\nPlant\
    \ phenotyping based on imaging techniques is a pertinent approach to quantify\n\
    the appearance and performance of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ while\naddressing the spatial heterogeneity of crop ﬁelds. Therefore, plant\
    \ phenotyping, applied\nto precision agriculture, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis\
    \ and detection of plant stress,\neven in the absence of symptoms. Optical sensors\
    \ have been used to study (a) the response\nof plants to pathogens, pests and\
    \ abiotic stressors; (b) to identify primary disease foci; (c) to\nmonitor resistance\
    \ or susceptibility of different plant genotypes to speciﬁc stress factors;\n\
    (d) to evaluate the severity of symptoms; (e) and to assess plant biomass and\
    \ yield [4].\nStomatal activity is one of the most important physiological traits\
    \ for plant growth\nand development. It plays a crucial role in the carbon and\
    \ water balance by controlling\nphotosynthesis and transpiration [5]. Hence, stomatal\
    \ conductance to water (gs) is related\nto yield and to the tolerance of environmental\
    \ stresses [6] and correlates strongly with leaf\ntemperature [7–9]. Thermal long-wave\
    \ infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras)\nare calibrated sensors able\
    \ to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm)\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68. https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13010068\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n2 of 21\nand provide images representing temperature\
    \ values per pixel. Thus, conventional, time-\nconsuming ground-based gs measurements\
    \ can be feasibly replaced by thermal images\nevaluating plant physiological status\
    \ at different scales in short periods of time [10,11]. Ad-\nditionally, highly\
    \ sensitive thermal cameras with a relatively simple operational procedure\nhave\
    \ become more available to research groups, at a lower cost and at higher spatial\
    \ reso-\nlution [12,13]. Moreover, TIR imaging is a very valuable method of stress\
    \ detection prior to\nthe appearance of symptoms since it operates out of the\
    \ visual range of the spectrum [14].\nHowever, some considerations must be taken\
    \ when interpreting thermograms in terms\nof gs since plant surface temperature\
    \ is mainly driven by environmental factors such as\nair temperature and relative\
    \ humidity. Even though high-end thermal cameras carry out\ncorrections for these\
    \ two parameters, there are other factors affecting canopy temperatures,\nsuch\
    \ as wind speed and light intensity, as well as by plant features, ranging from\
    \ leaf size\nor angle to canopy structure. A number of corrections for these factors\
    \ can be found in\nthe literature as TIR stress indices (Table 1). Some of these\
    \ parameters have been found\nto correlate with physiological traits related to\
    \ the water balance status of plants (Table 2).\nThe most common TIR parameters\
    \ are:\n1.\nNormalized canopy or leaf temperature with reference to air temperature\
    \ (∆T), uti-\nlized as an index of crop water status. The applications of ∆T was\
    \ recently reviewed\nby Still et al. [15];\n2.\nCrop water stress index (CSWI),\
    \ which introduces two baselines: (Tcanopy − Tair)wet\nas the estimated difference\
    \ for a well-watered plant, and (Tcanopy − Tair)dry for a\ndry (non-transpiring)\
    \ plant. CWSI is one of the most commonly used normalization\nmethods for TIR\
    \ measurements, which overcomes the effects of other environmental\nparameters\
    \ affecting plant temperature [16,17];\n3.\nIndex of stomatal conductance (IG),\
    \ since it is directly proportional to this parame-\nter [18];\n4.\nMaximum temperature\
    \ difference (MTD), calculated for every leaf or sample [19].\nThis parameter\
    \ has only been correlated with the severity of symptoms for several\ndiseases,\
    \ as reviewed in [20,21];\n5.\nNormalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT),\
    \ based on the maximum and the\nminimum temperature measured in the whole ﬁeld\
    \ trial. This parameter has been\nfound to be a valid estimation of the crop water\
    \ status [22];\n6.\nAverage canopy temperature (Tav), based on maximum and minimum\
    \ values of\ntemperature, was one of the ﬁrst parameters used by the conventional\
    \ infrared\nthermography [23,24]. However, this parameter can excessively simplify\
    \ outcome\ndata, and some important thermal information can be lost. Estimated\
    \ shape factors\nderived by ﬁtting the whole temperature data of the thermal images\
    \ to the Weibull\ndistribution could solve this constraint [25].\nTable 1. Most\

    AN\nPapaya\nPS\n[28]\nDespite the wide use of thermography applied to agronomy,\
    \ this technique per se\nhas a very limited capacity for diagnosis. Indeed, temperature\
    \ raises may be due to\nstomatal closure, which is on its own an unspeciﬁc mechanism\
    \ of plant defense against\nboth abiotic and biotic stressors. Even more, temperature\
    \ raises can also respond to a\ndecreased capacity for water evaporation or even\
    \ to the loss of vegetation [10]. In contrast,\nsome stresses can cause temporary\
    \ decreases in leaf temperature. That would be the case\nof some pathogens that\
    \ can interfere in the regulation of stomatal movements to favor\ntheir entry\
    \ to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence, alterations in TIR parameters stand\n\
    as ambiguous clues for diagnosis. Moreover, abiotic stress factors (mostly drought,\
    \ soil\nsalinity or extreme ambient temperature) also cause increases in canopy\
    \ temperature.\nThis is most important under natural conditions, where abiotic\
    \ stressors are difﬁcult to\nassess and avoid. Keeping in mind that under such\
    \ conditions, several stress factors often\naffect the vegetation simultaneously,\
    \ possible misinterpretations of TIR data would lead to\ninaccurate determination\
    \ of the incidence and severity of a particular pathogen infection\nor even to\
    \ a wrong diagnosis.\nTo overcome the restraints of thermography as a diagnostic\
    \ technique, authors have\nincreasingly applied it in combination with other imaging\
    \ techniques. Roitsch et al. [69]\nand Sperschneider [70] reviewed the implementation\
    \ of TIR cameras with other sensors,\nsuch as RGB, multi- or hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ in phenotyping platforms. The identiﬁcation\nof spatial and temporal patterns\
    \ of TIR parameters in combination with other relevant\nvegetation indices (VIs)\

    \ been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [15,20]. Furthermore,\nvery recent works\
    \ reviewed the state of the art in the application of artiﬁcial intelligence to\n\
    stress detection [70,72]. Despite the vast number of works addressing the use\
    \ of thermogra-\nphy for plant stress detection, little attention has been paid\
    \ to the physiological perspective\nof temperature alterations related to stressed\
    \ plants. Attending to this need, this review will\nrevise the most relevant applications\
    \ of thermography to agriculture with the main aim of\nproviding TIR camera users\
    \ with a collection of host plant–pathogen systems described in\nthe literature\
    \ in terms of thermal response and the mechanisms of plant defense involved.\n\
    Furthermore, a state-of-art review on the detection of abiotic stress by thermography\
    \ will\ncomplement our current knowledge on thermography applied to the diagnosis\
    \ of biotic\nstress in plants.\n2. Biotic Stress Detection by Thermography at\
    \ Different Scales\nStomata are the main natural entry of pathogens into the plant\
    \ tissues. Hence, the regu-\nlation of the stomatal movements plays a key role\
    \ in plant defense against microbes [86]. The\nrecognition of a potential pathogen\
    \ by plants usually triggers stomatal closure; to counteract\nthis defense response,\
    \ some pathogens are able to override the plant signaling pathways to\nactivate\
    \ stomatal aperture [87]. Other effects of pathogen infection include disturbances\
    \ on\nleaf development, cell wall and leaf cuticle composition or integrity, alterations\
    \ in the plant\nmetabolism or even necrosis of the tissues. These physical and\
    \ chemical disturbances affect\nthe plant water status, which can be monitored\
    \ by thermography [88–90].\n2.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    2.1.1. Viral Infections\nEven when some virosis cause alterations neither in gs\
    \ nor in leaf temperature [91],\nthermography is very often helpful in tracking\
    \ viral infections on plants. Most of those\nworks report temperature increases\
    \ between +0.5 and +1.5 K; on the contrary, some works\nreported decreases in\
    \ leaf temperature of −0.5 K relative to mock-controls. Hypersensi-\ntive response\
    \ (HR) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could be visualized as spots of elevated\n\
    temperature before any disease symptoms became visible on tobacco leaves. Those\
    \ spots\nwere conﬁned to the site of infection as a result of the HR triggered\
    \ by salicylic acid. On\nthe other hand, no thermal response was observed on susceptible\
    \ tobacco-TMV-infected\nplants [92]. In the case of Pepper middle mottle virus\
    \ (PMMoV)-Nicotiana benthamiana plants,\nvirus spreading through asymptomatic\
    \ leaves could be ﬁrst detected by an increase in\ntemperature on the tissues\
    \ around the main veins. This effect extended to adjacent tissues\nbefore the\
    \ spreading of the virus across the midrib of the leaf, as shown by immunolocaliza-\n\
    tion. Interestingly, the thermal symptoms caused by the most severe strain of\
    \ PMMoV were\ndetected before those caused by the less virulent one [93]. Among\
    \ other tobamoviruses,\nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucumber green mottle\
    \ mosaic virus (CGMMV) have a\nparticular impact on cucumber production. Plants\
    \ infected with CMV displayed homoge-\nneously higher temperature in the whole\
    \ inoculated leaf relative to the controls, whereas\nleaves of CGMMV-infected\
    \ cucumber plants showed a heterogeneous temperature pattern,\nconsisting of cold\
    \ spots at the infection sites. However, none of those changes was de-\ntectable\
    \ presymptomatically. Nevertheless, classiﬁcatory algorithms could early detect\
    \ the\ninfection caused by each pathogen when combining data obtained by TIR,\
    \ ﬂuorescence and\nhyperspectral imaging [94]. Another virus of agricultural interest\
    \ is the Sweet potato feathery\nmottle virus, which is the most widespread virus\
    \ that infects sweet potato plants, causing\ndevastating problems when co-infecting\
    \ with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus. Higher leaf\ntemperatures were associated\
    \ with more severe symptoms; thus, plants co-infected with\nboth viruses displayed\
    \ higher temperatures than single virus-infected plants [95].\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68\n6 of 21\n2.1.2. Bacterial Infections\nIn the case of bacterial-infected\
    \ plants, literature reports temperature changes relative\nto the controls ranging\
    \ between −3.3 K and +3 K. The tumor caused by Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens in the\
    \ hypocotyl of castor oil plant produces irreversible disruption of the plant\n\
    epidermis and hence, the tumor lacks a protective cuticle against water loss.\
    \ Moreover,\nstomata located at the tumor edge are hypertrophied and non-functional;\
    \ as a consequence,\nthe tumor surface was the coldest part of the plant [96].\
    \ Some works have studied the\nrole of plant defense elicitors produced by bacterial\
    \ pathogens. That is the case of the\nproteinaceous harpin synthesized by the\
    \ bacterium Erwinia amylovora. When inﬁltrated\nin the leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris\
    \ wild plants, harpin induced a marked presymptomatic\ncooling at the inoculation\
    \ sites, followed by an increase of temperature during the HR [97].\nThe same\
    \ trend was described for spots of bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae\n\
    pv. actinidiae on kiwifruit leaves [98]. The decrease in temperature localized\
    \ at the infection\nsites could be related to bacterial virulence factors that\
    \ actively open the stomata by\ninterfering with hormonal signaling pathways leading\
    \ to stomatal closure [99]. On the\nother hand, it is well known that recognition\
    \ of some pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns triggers stomatal closure to\
    \ impede bacterial entrance through these natural\napertures [68]. In bean plants,\
    \ P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces an HR, whereas\nP. syringae pv. phaseolicola\
    \ 1448A produces systemic infection. First symptoms are evident\nafter 10 h and\
    \ 2 days post-infection, respectively. Thermography could presymptomatically\n\
    reveal those bacterial challenges as an increase of temperature of the inoculated\
    \ areas at 1\nand 2 h post-infection in the case of HR and systemic infection,\
    \ respectively [100].\nSeveral works have addressed the effect of the Dickeya\
    \ dadantii infection on plant tran-\nspiration by thermography. This bacterium\
    \ usually produces soft-rot, a characteristic tissue\nmaceration, as in the case\
    \ of N. benthamiana infected at high inoculum dose. After mechani-\ncal inﬁltration,\
    \ the temperature of the affected areas raised presymptomatically, linked to\n\
    an increase in hormones controlling stomatal closure. In subsequent days, the\
    \ temperature\ncontinued rising, affecting the whole leaf. However, N. benthamiana\
    \ can activate an efﬁcient\ndefense response against D. dadantii when the plant\
    \ is inoculated at doses resembling the\nnatural infection. In this case, after\
    \ an initial increase in temperature of the inﬁltrated\narea, infected plants\
    \ could recover, and temperature subsequently decreased [101]. Inde-\npendently\
    \ of the inoculum dose, D. dadantii does not cause tissue maceration on melon\n\
    leaves. It produces brownish spots at the inoculation sites that evolve chlorosis\
    \ in the\nsurrounding tissues in successive days; those symptoms appeared earlier\
    \ when high dose\nconcentrations were applied. Only inﬁltrated areas shown increased\
    \ temperatures at the\nbeginning of the infection process when inoculated at a\
    \ low dose; the whole leaf ﬁnally\ndisplaying higher temperature respecting to\
    \ the controls. However, when a high inoculum\ndose was applied, the whole melon\
    \ leaf displayed a higher temperature [102]. The whole\nleaf of another cucurbit,\
    \ such as zucchini, displayed higher temperature relative to the\ncontrols when\
    \ inoculated with D. dadantii, whereas visual symptoms (different degrees\nof\
    \ chlorosis proportional to the inoculated dose) were circumscribed to the inﬁltrated\n\
    spots [103,104]. Features extracted from TIR and multicolor ﬂuorescence images\
    \ were used\nto feed algorithms, which provided a good performance of classiﬁcation\
    \ of plants into\ncategories of infected and controls in both melon and zucchini\
    \ plants [102–104].\n2.1.3. Interactions with Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes\n\
    Thermography has been widely used to assess the effect of fungi and oomycetes\
    \ on\nhost plant transpiration. Depending on how these pathogens interact with\
    \ host plants,\ninitial phases of pathogenesis can induce increases or decreases\
    \ in leaf temperatures\naffecting only the inoculation sites or wholes leaves.\
    \ Subsequent symptoms development\nmay cause transitory drops in temperature as\
    \ the affected cells die and lose water. Later\ninfection phases usually lead\
    \ to an increase in temperature due to the lack of natural\ncooling of the necrotic\
    \ tissues. Concerning healthy areas, it is possible to ﬁnd in the cited\nliterature\
    \ that biotrophic fungi and oomycetes can cause temperature decreases ranging\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n7 of 21\nfrom −0.1 to −2.5 K, whereas increases have\
    \ been registered from +0.6 to +2 K. For their\npart, hemibiotrophic pathogens\
    \ can decrease leaf temperature between −0.6 and −2.2 K, or\ncontrary, increase\
    \ it in +0.4 to +7.5 K. Finally, it is possible to register temperatures decreases\n\
    between −2 and −5 K and increases ranging from +0.3 to +9 K when necrotrophic\
    \ fungi\nare studied by TIR imaging.\nConcerning infections caused by biotrophic\
    \ fungi leaves from wheat plants infected\nwith Blumeria graminis or Puccinia\
    \ striiformis (fungi causing powdery mildew and stripe\nrust, respectively) displayed\
    \ low temperatures due to the very low resistance to water\nevaporation of growing\
    \ mycelia [105,106]. The phytopathogens Pseudoperonospora cubensis\nand Podosphaera\
    \ xanthii are the causal agents of cucumber downy mildew and cucurbits\npowdery\
    \ mildew, respectively. In cucumber leaves, these pathogens produce infective\n\
    spots with lower temperatures than the surrounding healthy areas due to an abnormal\n\
    stomatal opening. In the case of P. xanthii infection, the thermographic detection\
    \ was\nnot presymptomatic, whereas disease caused by P. cubensis could be revealed\
    \ one day\nbefore the appearance of symptoms. Under laboratory conditions, the\
    \ MTD increased\nduring both pathogenesis and was related to disease severity\
    \ [19,94,107,108]. Despite\nbeing a biotrophic oomycete, P. cubensis also produces\
    \ necrosis in the latest infection phase\nassociated with an increase in cucumber\
    \ leaf temperature [19,108]. Leaves of rose infected\nwith the fungus Podosphaera\
    \ pannosa var. rosae (causal agent of powdery mildew in roses)\nshowed a presymptomatic\
    \ decrease in temperature. Furthermore, two algorithms were\ntrained on features\
    \ extracted from TIR images, obtaining high accuracy in classifying\nhealthy and\
    \ infected plants [109]. Raza et al. [110] also used information extracted from\
    \ TIR\nand RGB pictures to automatically detect tomato plants infected with Oidium\
    \ neolycopersici\nin a presymptomatic way, but the work did not address the physiological\
    \ changes caused\nby the fungus.\nRegarding hemibiotrophic fungi, TIR imaging\
    \ could describe the severity of the\ninfection, which could be related to the\
    \ disease stages but also to the host plant resistance\nto the pathogen. Thus,\
    \ Oerke et al. [111] and Belin et al. [112] analyzed apple trees\nsuffering from\
    \ apple scab. In that case, the detection of infection, as well as differences\n\
    in the virulence of several Venturia inaequalis isolates infecting apple trees,\
    \ were detected\nmore accurately by thermography than by chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging. The thermal\nresponse was presymptomatic and consisted of spots of\
    \ decreased temperature due to\nthe subcuticular growth of V. inaequalis. A soilborne\
    \ fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, induces\nnecrosis in lettuce plants, which could\
    \ be visualized as an increase in leaf temperature\nand MTD [113]. The damage\
    \ produced by another soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum,\nto whole cucumber\
    \ leaves could be detected as a presymptomatic raise in temperature\ninduced by\
    \ abscisic acid, followed by a slight decrease as wilt symptoms developed. Finally,\n\
    the temperature of whole leaves presenting necrosis increased again [114]. On\
    \ the contrary,\npea plants infected with this fungus showed an early and slight\
    \ reduction of temperature\ncompared to the control plants. At an advanced stage\
    \ of the infection, the leaf temperature\nincreased above control levels in the\
    \ case of susceptible plants, whereas the temperature of\nthose showing F. oxysporum-resistance\
    \ remained similar to the controls [115].\nIn the case of infections caused by\
    \ necrotrophic fungi, sugar beet plants inoculated\nwith Cercospora beticola (causal\
    \ agent of Cercospora leaf spot) displayed spots of presymp-\ntomatic low temperature\
    \ corresponding to the infection sites. Cold spots appeared pro-\ngressively until\
    \ covering the whole leaf surface, whereas lesions were hardly visible by\nthe\
    \ naked eye. Toxins inﬂuencing cell membrane permeability and produced by C. beticola\n\
    could account for this temperature decrease [92]. Aspergillus carbonarius is a\
    \ fungus causing\nsour rot of grape berries and produces ochratoxin-As, toxic\
    \ for humans. Mycelium growth\nareas showed low temperatures that identiﬁed affected\
    \ fruit sites at the very early-stages of\nA. carbonarius infection [25]. Thermography\
    \ also revealed that Alternaria alternata, A. bras-\nsicae and A. brassicicola\
    \ caused a decrease of temperature during the ﬁrst seven days of\ninfection on\
    \ oilseed rape leaves, followed by a temperature increase in successive days.\n\
    However, those plants inoculated with A. dauci only developed increases of mean\
    \ tem-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n8 of 21\nperature at 21 days after inoculation\
    \ [116]. The infection with Botrytis cinerea (gray mold)\non bean plants caused\
    \ a presymptomatic increase of temperature at the infection sites. In\nsubsequent\
    \ days, leaves developed hot brownish necrotic lesions surrounded by a lower\n\
    temperature area [117]. Contrary, B. cinerea–infected roses ﬁrst showed a decrease\
    \ of tem-\nperature at regions where lesions were initially formed, followed by\
    \ a rise in temperature\nonce necrosis occurred [109]. Rosellinia necatrix (soilborne\
    \ fungus causing white root rot) is\none of the most important constraints to\
    \ production for a wide range of woody crops such\nas avocado. In the late phases\
    \ of R. necatrix infection, trees undergo a water deﬁcit in the\naerial part due\
    \ to failure of the root system [118]. As a result, infected plants experienced\
    \ a\nsigniﬁcant increase in leaf temperature from the early symptomatic stage\
    \ onwards [119].\nFurthermore, infected avocado trees in an orchard could be detected\
    \ by thermography (see\nSection 2.2) [120].\n2.1.4. Herbivory and Parasitic Plants\n\
    Herbivore insects disrupt the integrity of leaves, leading to uncontrolled water\
    \ loss\nfrom wounds and triggering intricate processes that affect gas exchange\
    \ also in the re-\nmaining leaf tissue. Thus, it is possible to ﬁnd temperature\
    \ drops from −0.3 to −3 K\nin the literature. TIR images of soybean leaﬂets affected\
    \ by corn earworm caterpillars\n(Helicoverpa zea) showed that leaf areas adjacent\
    \ to wounds were cooler than distant regions\nor sister leaﬂets [121]. The same\
    \ leaf temperature pattern was visible after injuries caused\nby cabbage looper\
    \ (Trichoplusia ni) instars on Arabidopsis [122], tobacco hornworm (Man-\nduca\
    \ sexta) on Nicotiana attenuata [123], or larval gypsy moth (Lymantria dyspar)\
    \ and gall\ndamage produced by midge ﬂies (Harmandia sp.) on aspen leaves [124].\
    \ When elevated\nCO2 was applied to the atmosphere, the cooling effect of gall\
    \ formation on remaining leaf\ntissue was reduced [124].\nThermography was also\
    \ useful in the detection of plants infested by parasites, reveal-\ning temperature\
    \ increases (from +0.4 to +0.9 K) due to a reduction in the plant water uptake\n\
    by affected roots. Examples of these interactions are the nematode Heterodera\
    \ schachtii\nwith susceptible sugar beet cultivars [125], as well as the obligatory\
    \ root parasitic plant\nOrobanche cumana (broomrape) and sunﬂower [126]. The early\
    \ detection of broomrape\nby nondestructive techniques was unprecedented since\
    \ natural infestation causes subtle\nalterations on host physiology and proceeds\
    \ unnoticed until the emergence of the ﬂoral\nshoots, by the time of sunﬂower\
    \ bloom.\n2.2. Remote Sensing on Crop Fields\nIn crop ﬁelds, thermography has\
    \ facilitated the detailed analysis of crop ﬁelds affected\nby pathogens, helping\
    \ in the localization of areas where plants are infected and requiring\nurgent\
    \ intervention [127]. In general, pathogen-infected plants show changes in their\n\
    temperature of -2 K to +3.1 K, relative to the temperature of healthy plants;\
    \ however, it is\nworth noticing that these values should be handled with care\
    \ depending on the sensitivity\nand the accuracy of the used TIR cameras. The\
    \ identiﬁcation of potentially infected plants\nusing classiﬁers provides accuracies\
    \ ranging between 59 and 89%, depending on the\napplied algorithm and parameters\
    \ used to feed it.\nIn sugar beet, canopy temperature correlated signiﬁcantly\
    \ with the density of the\nnematode parasite H. schachtii in the case of a susceptible\
    \ cultivar, whereas no correlation\ncould be found for the resistant one [128].\
    \ P. syringae pv. actinidiae infection in kiwifruit\norchards was assessed by\
    \ TIR maps based on canopy temperature. Images revealed\nthat infected trees were\
    \ signiﬁcantly warmer than the healthy ones, being localized in\nthe outer canes\
    \ of the canopy [98]. Temperature increases measured on pines infected\nwith Dothistroma\
    \ septosporum (causal agent of red band needle blight) and on winter wheat\ninfected\
    \ with Zymoseptoria tritici (causing septoria leaf blotch) could be positively\
    \ correlated\nto the damages caused by these hemibiotrophic fungi [90,129]. Necrotic\
    \ spots on leaves\nfrom three woody trees (oriental cherry, Japanese cornel and\
    \ sawtooth oak) caused by three\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n9 of 21\nfungi (Mycosphaerella\
    \ cerasella, Elsinoe corni and Tubakia dryina, respectively) can also be\ndetected\
    \ as dots with higher temperatures relative to healthy areas [130].\nThe fusion\
    \ of thermography with other imaging techniques such as multi- or hyper-\nspectral\
    \ reﬂectance or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging cameras is very often an adequate\n\
    approach for stress detection. The combination with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging\
    \ al-\nlowed monitoring several constraints (fungal infection, galls and chewing\
    \ damages caused\nby arthropods) in understory hardwood saplings. Thus, changes\
    \ in transpiration could be\nrelated to photosynthesis impairment in affected\
    \ trees [131]. However, the combination\nof TIR imaging with multi- or hyper-spectroscopy\
    \ reﬂectance is more feasible since both\ntechniques are based on passive measurements.\
    \ Moreover, it is possible to obtain multi-\nple reﬂectance VIs that could correlate\
    \ with physiological parameters. Furthermore, VIs,\ntogether with temperature\
    \ derived parameters, could be implemented on algorithms to\nclassify plants into\
    \ categories of interest in the earliest stages of infection. That was the\ncase\
    \ of important bacterial diseases causing a high impact on both agriculture and\
    \ the envi-\nronment, such as citrus greening or Huanglongbing in citrus trees\
    \ [132], or Xylella fastidiosa,\na quarantine pathogen in olive orchards [133].\n\
    In the case of diseases caused by foliar fungal pathogens, the joint use of thermography\n\
    and reﬂectance made it possible to discriminate between severity levels. That\
    \ was the\ncase of red leaf blotch (caused by Polystigma amygdalinum) in almond\
    \ trees [134] and also\nearly and late leaf spot diseases (caused by Passalora\
    \ arachidicola S. Hori and Cercosporidium\npersonatum, respectively) on peanut\
    \ trees [135]. Minimum temperature corrected by air\ntemperature showed a negative\
    \ correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) in opium\
    \ poppy orchards infected by the oomycete Peronospora arborescens (causal\nagent\
    \ of downy mildew) [136]. Furthermore, a strong relationship between yield, several\n\
    VIs and canopy temperature was observed in maize plants suffering tar spot complex\n\
    (caused by Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis) [137], as well as in chickpea\n\
    infected with Ascochyta rabiei (causing Ascochyta blight disease) [138].\n∆T correlated\
    \ with disease severity caused by soilborne fungal pathogens, such as\nVerticillium\
    \ dahliae (causal agent of Verticillium wilt) in olive trees or R. necatrix in\
    \ avocado\ntrees. Moreover, classifying algorithms applied to the data obtained\
    \ by spectral and TIR\nimaging could identify affected trees with high accuracy\
    \ [120,139,140].\n3. Assessing of Plant Abiotic Stress by Thermography\nIn natural\
    \ environments, abiotic stress conditions often concur with biotic stresses,\n\
    making their evaluation difﬁcult. For this reason, it is important to understand\
    \ how abiotic\nconditions can affect vegetation. The successive sections will\
    \ review how thermography\nhas been applied to monitor crop water stress, salinity,\
    \ nutrient availability, and application\nof herbicides, among others, at proximal\
    \ and remote scales.\n3.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    Drought, which importance emerges from the damage caused and its extent, is con-\n\
    sequently one of the main abiotic stresses monitored by TIR imaging to help farmers\
    \ to\nestablish precise water management and scheduling [141]. Most of the studies\

    \ for plants. In addition, ions can accumulate in plant leaves\nup to toxic concentrations\
    \ [142]. Thus, TIR imaging provides an opportunity to screen\nfor salinity tolerance\

    \ +0.7 to +7 K between healthy and stressed\nplants have been reported in the\
    \ literature at a remote sensing scale. These alterations in\ncanopy temperature\
    \ allowed stress detection with accuracies up to 75% using classiﬁcatory\nalgorithms\
    \ based on TIR stress indices.\nVineyards under different water regimes are proposed\
    \ as an exemplary study model\nthanks to the geometry of orchards. Moreover, climate\
    \ change threatens the most important\nwine-producer countries worldwide, which\
    \ will suffer increased frequency and severity\nof drought periods. On the contrary,\
    \ ﬁne-tuning irrigation management during the grow-\ning season leads to a slight-to-moderate\
    \ water deﬁcit, which stimulates optimal grape\nquality without signiﬁcantly compromising\
    \ yield [47]. Many authors have monitored\nphysiological parameters related to\
    \ water balance by handheld devices and correlated\nthem with stress indices extracted\
    \ from TIR images (Table 2). They found that TIR imaging\ncan distinguish between\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated canopies and even between different\ndeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments. However, the relationship between TIR stress indices and\nphysiological\
    \ parameters was found to be stable throughout the season in some cases [47]\n\
    or, on the contrary, affected by the phenological stage or the varieties [49,158].\
    \ All these\nworks have used TIR ground-based cameras positioned (lateral or nadir)\
    \ or implemented\non UAVs. However, it is also possible to use TIR images from\
    \ Landsat-5 for irrigation\nmanagement purposes [159].\nAs the water demand for\
    \ agriculture is steadily increasing, exploring indices obtained\nby thermography\
    \ to evaluate drought stress in other crops different from vineyards also\nhas\
    \ been extensively addressed (Table 2). The efﬁciency of the VI named photochemical\n\
    reﬂectance index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress was evaluated by TIR imaging\
    \ in\nolive and peach orchards under different water regimes. It was found that\
    \ PRI showed a\nhigher correlation with ∆T and gs than other vegetation indices\
    \ [30,160]. Regarding the\nmonitoring of water regimes in crops using satellite\
    \ images, thermal images taken with\nASTER could distinguish between rain-fed\
    \ and artiﬁcially irrigated olive tree orchards [161].\nBased on these works,\
    \ it can be concluded that thermal information remotely obtained by\nTIR cameras,\
    \ alone or in combination with other imaging techniques, is robust enough to\n\
    estimate the water status of crops and to help farmers to establish an appropriate\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling for plantations. However, this conclusion should be taken\
    \ with caution since\nthere are exceptions to the rule. As an example, canopy\
    \ temperature in maize ﬁelds under\ndrought stress only partially reﬂected gas\
    \ exchange rates and grain yield, presumably as a\nconsequence of other alterations\
    \ caused by this stress factor in plants, such as impairments\nin photosynthesis\
    \ and partitioning rates or alterations in plant leaves and canopy structures\n\
    (leading to ﬂuctuations in energy absorption and/or dissipation) [162]. Moreover,\
    \ the use\nof TIR imaging to ﬁgure out biologically relevant traits constitutes\
    \ a challenge under\nﬂuctuating conditions, as recently reviewed by Vialet-Chabrand\
    \ and Lawson [75].\nIn addition to physiological variables related to the water\
    \ status of plants, production\nparameters such as grain yield could be evaluated\
    \ by thermography in cereals. That was\nthe case of spring barley [163], maize\
    \ [162] and wheat [61,164,165], where grain yield under\ndifferent water regimes\
    \ showed good correlations with TIR stress indices. CWSI is a good\npredictor\
    \ of garlic bulb biomass under different water availability levels [166]. Another\n\
    production parameter, the average fruit weight of mandarins “clementina de Nules”\
    \ at\nharvest, could also be correlated signiﬁcantly with canopy temperature when\
    \ different\nirrigation regimes were tested [32].\nRegarding the nutrient availability\
    \ in soils, wheat crops growing under higher nitrogen\nsupplies exhibited lower\
    \ canopy temperature (and thus, lower CWSI) than those that were\nnot treated\
    \ [167]. Kefauver et al. [168] compared different nitrogen treatments in three\n\
    barley varieties and elaborated a detailed correlation network of physiological\
    \ traits, TIR\nand other imaging data. Another common stress in crop ﬁelds is\
    \ low temperatures. TIR\nimaging has been applied to study frost resistance in\
    \ apple orchards. When the soil was\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n12 of 21\ndefrosted,\
    \ the whole tree froze starting from peripheral twigs, whereas when the soil was\n\
    frosted, the tree started to freeze from the trunk at the tree base [169].\n4.\
    \ Future Perspectives\nFor more sustainable agriculture, the development of tools\
    \ providing real-time in-\nformation on the health status of plants is highly\
    \ demanded, as well as on their physical\nand physiological interactions with\
    \ their micro- and macro-environment, from soil to\natmosphere. In this sense,\
    \ the progressive implementation of high-throughput analysis\nbased on imaging\
    \ sensors and big data have represented an outstanding innovation [72].\nAutomation\
    \ allows rapid evaluations of plants and crops, avoiding subjectivity associ-\n\
    ated with visual assessments, reducing the cost of labor and permitting more frequent\n\
    assessments on the same plants over time [21]. Indeed, thermography implemented\
    \ in\nhigh-throughput facilities is contributing to the development of next-generation\
    \ crops by\ncrop breeders. However, before thermal sensing is adopted as a routine\
    \ tool in agriculture\nand integrated into decision-making for a wide range of\
    \ users, further research is necessary\nto address current challenges of the technology\
    \ and interpretation of thermal data [13,76].\n4.1. Future Technical Development\
    \ of Thermography\nTIR cameras suffer from challenges common to sensors for image\
    \ acquisition. At the\nproximal sensor scale, the volume of plants that can be\
    \ monitored at the same time is a\nlimitation. On the other hand, standardized\
    \ environments of measurements at a short\ndistance from the target may complicate\
    \ the scale up to the ﬁeld. Indeed, at a remote\nsensing scale, atmospheric conditions\
    \ are challenging. Wind makes the crops move around\nor may destabilize UAVs affecting\
    \ the quality of images. Rain, fog, and other atmospheric\nfactors could delay\
    \ scheduled measurements. Even more, satellites could not cover the\nentire desired\
    \ area or do it when atmospheric conditions are inadequate, reducing their\ntime\
    \ resolution or even limiting the measurements during long periods in the rainy\
    \ seasons.\nOperational conditions of TIR cameras must be observed, whereas technical\
    \ features,\nsuch as sensitivity and accuracy, should be taken into consideration\
    \ when handling thermal\ndata to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Thermography\
    \ also needs corrections\nto the accuracy of leaf or canopy measurements via the\
    \ development of more accurate\ncomplementary measurements of atmospheric conditions\
    \ disturbing the temperature of\nthe vegetation. That would include wind speed\
    \ and reﬂection of solar radiation on canopy\nsurfaces, dependent on the intensity\
    \ and quality of light affected by weather conditions\non day ﬂights, as reviewed\
    \ in [15,80]. Particular attention must be paid to the spatial\nand temporal variations\
    \ in these factors during the actual measurement. Even though\nthe last generation\
    \ of thermal cameras can make corrections for relative humidity and\ntemperature\
    \ of the air, these atmospheric parameters should be taken into account for other\n\
    TIR sensors. These complementary measurements are needed to improve the quality\
    \ of\nthe thermal data and to help in interpreting thermal information [15]. The\
    \ use of current\nUAVs minimizes the time-of-measurement effects [76]. On the\
    \ other hand, ﬂight altitude\naffects the measurements due to thermal infrared\
    \ radiation attenuation by the atmosphere,\nrequiring some corrections [65]. Focal\
    \ length, related to the ﬂying altitude, is another\ntechnical feature to take\
    \ into consideration in airborne thermography [170]. Nonetheless,\nnanosatellites\
    \ and new generation satellites with increasingly higher time and spatial\nresolution\
    \ could be the future of remote sensing applied to agriculture [84].\nPublic datasets\
    \ are progressively gaining relevance in plant phenotyping, as in many\nother\
    \ research ﬁelds since they offer great opportunities for networking and collaboration.\n\
    However, comparing data with other researchers is limited by technical features.\
    \ A possible\nsolution for this issue would be the development of a system of\
    \ standardization (similar to\nthose issued by the International Commission on\
    \ Illumination, CIE) that could be adopted\nby the international community.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n13 of 21\n4.2. Strategies to Overcome the Intrinsic\
    \ Non-Speciﬁcity of Thermal Patterns\nThermography is a sensitive tool for plant\
    \ stress detection. However, alterations in leaf\nor canopy temperature are intrinsically\
    \ unspeciﬁc for the stressor. Indeed, on crop ﬁelds\nunder natural conditions,\
    \ plant diseases are often found concurrent with abiotic stresses.\nConsequently,\
    \ in terms of diagnosis, thermography must be used in combination with other\n\
    phenomics techniques with the aim of ﬁnding distinctive patterns that better explain\
    \ the\netiology of the disorder, thus helping to cut down potential causes of\
    \ disease. Appropriate\nmanagement and control of abiotic stress factors considering\
    \ the heterogeneities of the\nfarmed land appear mandatory to avoid misinterpretations\
    \ of the thermal imagery. For\nexample, in orchards, water management can be improved\
    \ by precise measurements of\nsoil humidity by thermography, as reviewed by [171].\
    \ Thus, an accurate diagnosis and\nquantiﬁcation of the extent and severity of\
    \ disease-related symptoms can only be achieved\nbased on a collection of inputs\
    \ such as the geological features and history of the farmed\nland or weather conditions\
    \ at the time of image collection.\nDeep learning is key in the process of turning\
    \ data into knowledge, particularly when\nthermography is integrated with other\
    \ imaging techniques in a multidimensional analysis,\nas recently reviewed by\
    \ [72]. Public accessibility and interoperability of datasets, from\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platforms and satellites, promoted by cooperative initiatives\n\
    such as those funded by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-\n\
    phenotyping.org), are contributing to develop the potential of plant phenotyping\
    \ [172].\n4.3. Uses of Plant Thermography for Agriculture in the Near Future\n\
    In recent years, huge investments have been made in plant phenotyping facilities\
    \ to\nsupport basic and applied research. Further work is needed to widen our\
    \ knowledge on\nplant physiology upon stress as well as developing improved stress\
    \ detection methods.\nFuture research should also address the development of more\
    \ general stress detection\nmethods, valid for a range of plant species and growth\
    \ conditions, including location,\nor even independent from those factors. The\
    \ contribution of thermography to precision\nagriculture should not be limited\
    \ to the detection of stress.\nThermography also appears as a very convenient\
    \ tool to study other aspects of plants\nthat are out of the scope of this review,\
    \ such as seeds vigor [173], investigations on circadian\nrhythms [174,175], the\
    \ effects of microgravity on plant physiology [176], interactions with\nplant-symbiotic\
    \ microorganisms [177–180], the impact of climate change in ecology [15],\nor\
    \ food industry [181]. Thermography is also a very relevant tool for screening\
    \ for mu-\ntants [182,183] and cultivars [21] with desirable phenotypes such as\
    \ pathogen resistance\nor improved performance upon certain abiotic stress conditions.\
    \ In summary, thermog-\nraphy implemented in high-throughput facilities is contributing\
    \ to the development of\nnext-generation crops by crop breeders.\n5. Concluding\
    \ Remarks\nThe huge collection of works applying thermography to plants and crops\
    \ shows that\nthis technique is overcoming inherent constraints, being able to\
    \ determine plant water\nstatus and to detect plant stress in a robust, reliable,\
    \ low-cost way. On one hand, TIR stress\nindices are often more reliable than\
    \ actual temperature values as they counteract the effects\nof ambient conditions\
    \ on the measurement, providing good correlations with physiological\nparameters\
    \ related to the plant water status. On the other hand, the combined use of\n\
    thermography with other imaging sensors and the application of big data tools\
    \ are an\nadvantageous approach that allows identifying stressed plants and even\
    \ evaluating the\nseverity of symptoms. In spite of this, more detailed studies\
    \ are needed to build a solid\nbase of knowledge applicable to practitioners.\
    \ Additionally, platforms based on imaging\ntechnologies should be developed to\
    \ cover the needs of a wide range of end-users.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n14\

    Spatiotemporal Crop Water Stress in schedule Irrigation: A review Elham Koohi,
    Silvio Jose Gumiere, and Hossein Bonakdari Laval University, Soils and Agri-Food
    Engineering, Canada (elham.koohikeradeh.1@ulaval.ca) Water used in agricultural
    crops can be managed by irrigation scheduling based on plant water stress thresholds.
    Automated irrigation scheduling limits crop physiological damage and yield reduction.
    Knowledge of crop water stress monitoring approaches can be effective in optimizing
    the use of agricultural water. Understanding the physiological mechanisms of crop
    responding and adapting to water deficit ensures sustainable agricultural management
    and food supply. This aim could be achieved by analyzing stomatal conductance,
    growth rate, leaf water potential, and stem water potential. Calculating thresholds
    of soil matric potential, and available water content improves the precision of
    irrigation management by preventing water limitations between irrigations. Crop
    monitoring and irrigation management make informed decisions using geospatial
    technologies, the internet of things, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
    Remote sensing (RS) could be applied whenever in situ data are not available.
    High-resolution crop mapping extracts information through index-based methods
    fed by the multitemporal and multi-sensor data used in detection and classification.
    Precision Agriculture (PA) means applying farm inputs at the right amount, at
    the right time, and in the right place. RS in PA captures images in different
    spatial, and spectral resolutions through in-field, satellites, aerial, and handheld
    or tractor-mounted such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) sensors. RS sensors
    receive the electromagnetic signals of plant responses in different spectral domains.
    Optical satellite data, including narrow-band multispectral remote sensing techniques
    and thermal imagery, is used for water stress detection. To process and analysis
    RS data, cloud storage and computing platforms simplify the complex mathematical
    of incorporating various datasets for irrigation scheduling. Machine learning
    (ML) algorithms construct models for the regression and classification of multivariate
    and non-linear crop mapping. The web-based software gathered from all different
    datasets makes a reliable product to reinforce farmers’ ability to make appropriate
    decisions in irrigating agricultural crops. Keywords: Agricultural crops; Crop
    water stress detection; Irrigation scheduling; Precision agriculture; Remote Sensing.

    scale. • Modeled MODIS ET was validated using LAS observations over different
    land covers. • Land surface heterogeneity was evaluated with Landsat data. Abstract
    Operational estimation of spatio-temporal continuously daily evapotranspiration
    (ET), and the components evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), at river basin
    scale is very useful for developing sustainable water resource strategies, particularly
    in regions of limited water supplies. In this study, multi-year all-weather daily
    ET, E and T were estimated using MODIS-based (Dual Temperature Difference) DTD
    model under different land covers in the Heihe river basin in China, with a total
    area of approximately 143 × 103 km2. The remotely sensed ET was validated using
    ground measurements from large aperture scintillometer systems, with a source
    area of several kilometers, over grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest
    land cover. The results showed that the remotely sensed ET produced mean absolute
    percent differences (MAPD) of around 20% with the ground measurements during the
    growing season under clear sky conditions, but the model performance deteriorated
    for cloudy days. However, the daily ET product gave reasonable estimates for croplands
    with an MAPD value of about 20% and the estimates of T/ET and E/ET in good agreement
    with ground measurements. The DTD model also significantly outperformed other
    remote sensing-based models being applied globally. Based on these results the
    DTD model is considered reliable for monitoring crop water use and stress and
    to develop efficient irrigation strategies. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Arid and semi-arid lands cover approximately 40% of the world''s
    land surface, which are inhabited by nearly 40% of the total global population
    (Reynolds et al., 2007). Many of these regions are affected by periodic droughts
    resulting in water and food shortages as well as environmental degradation. What''s
    more, many endorheic basins (closed inland river basin) in these areas have experienced
    significant environmental stresses from rapid population growth and economic development.
    In many of these river basins, water requirements for sustaining economic growth
    while maintaining ecosystem functioning have exceeded the available resources
    (Li et al., 2018a, Li et al., 2018b). Specifically, the significant increase in
    water consumption from the agricultural irrigation from the upland water sources
    of the catchment has led to serious degradation downstream. Therefore, it is critical
    to develop a water resource strategy that can not only support agricultural and
    commercial development but also sustains the ecological integrity of the river
    basin. The aim of efficient and effective irrigation management is to provide
    sufficient water to a growing crop, replenishing depleted plant available water,
    and avoid crop water stress (Wright, 1985). However, the actual rate of water
    use by vegetation can vary significantly due to soil properties, amount of vegetation
    cover, phenology, atmospheric demand and disease. Usually, the difference between
    the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration (ET) are applied to identify
    crop water deficits as well as the variable crop water use rate (Anderson et al.,
    2012). This ET information is needed for developing efficient irrigation strategies
    under different land cover conditions. One approach to efficiently assess and
    monitor spatially distributed water use and stress at large scale is using satellite-based
    estimates of ET and its components of evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), quantifying
    the net loss of water vapor to the atmosphere (Semmens et al., 2016; Yang et al.,
    2018). In addition, accurate partitioning of ET into E and T permits the assessment
    of how much irrigated water contributes to the crop growth and ultimately yield
    compared with non-beneficial water loss from bare soil evaporation. What''s more,
    at global scale, spatial distribution of land ET, E and T play an essential role
    in modeling water, energy and carbon cycles (Miralles et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
    2016). The two-source energy balance model (TSEB) is a relatively simple physically-based
    approach that can partition the composite radiative temperature and energy fluxes
    into their components from soil and vegetation (Kustas and Anderson, 2009; Kustas
    and Norman, 1999; Norman et al., 1995). Based on the TSEB scheme, the Dual Temperature
    Difference (DTD) model reduces sensitivity to errors in remote sensing land surface
    temperature retrievals and to some extent non-local meteorological forcing (Guzinski
    et al., 2013; Norman et al., 2000). DTD has already been applied to use land surface
    temperatures from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board
    the Terra and Aqua satellites to estimate daily land surface fluxes, ET, E and
    T at different spatial resolutions (Guzinski et al., 2014). However, satellite-based
    thermal infrared measurements cannot penetrate clouds, which produces spatio-temporal
    discontinuities in the land surface temperature retrievals and consequently ET
    at regional scales. On a global basis nearly 50% of the land surface is cloud
    cover prohibiting estimates of ET using thermal-infrared (Jin and Dickinson, 1999).
    Therefore, a reliable interpolation technique is needed, which integrates meteorological
    data on cloudy days and remotely sensed fluxes from a recent clear-sky observation
    to provide continuous daily ET (Van Niel et al., 2012; Van Niel et al., 2011).
    An example of an interpolation approach is using data assimilation approach coupled
    to a prognostic land surface model (Xu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016). The accuracy
    of remotely sensed ET products varies over space and time, and land cover type.
    Their uncertainty at the instantaneous and daily scales range from approximately
    15–30%, however, errors can exceed 50% on an annual basis (Kalma et al., 2008;
    Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Understanding these variations in the accuracy of remotely
    sensed ET products is important when implementing water resource management strategy
    at watershed scales, especially in water limited regions where irrigation from
    surface or ground water resources exceeds recharge rates. Moreover, knowledge
    of how the accuracy of remotely sensed ET products varies with season, land cover
    type and climate zones are critical for improving the models in order that they
    can be used to develop more efficient irrigation management tools, and water resource
    planning for sustainable agricultural production and ecosystem functioning. The
    objectives of this paper are to estimate and validate daily land surface ET, E
    and T partitioning using the remote sensing-based DTD model together with MODIS
    and meteorological data at river basin scale. These instantaneous and daily remote
    sensing-based ET products are validated with in situ ET measurements at the satellite
    pixel resolution derived from optical large aperture scintillometer (LAS) estimates
    of sensible heat flux in combination with aggregated net radiation and surface
    soil heat flux. DTD model estimates of the partitioning of ET into E and T were
    evaluated using the T/ET and E/ET ratios derived from the flux variance similarity
    (FVS) partitioning method (Skaggs et al., 2018) and from isotopic technology (Wen
    et al., 2016), respectively, at the midstream site during the HiWATER experiment
    (June to September in 2012). Finally, the spatio-temporal dynamics of water use
    is analyzed for both natural vegetation and agroecosystems in the river basin.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area and field measurements The study area
    is the Heihe River Basin, which is in the middle of the Hexi corridor in northwestern
    China (Fig. 1) and covers an area of approximately 1,432,000 km2 (Cheng et al.,
    2014; Li et al., 2013). The basin is characterized by cryosphere in mountainous
    headwaters that include glaciers, frozen soil, alpine meadow and forest; by crops
    such as maize, wheat and vegetable symmetrically distributed along the irrigation
    district in the midstream; and by riparian ecosystems and widespread desert downstream
    (Cheng et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013). The basin is in an arid and semi-arid region
    where the mean annual (1971–2000) air temperatures are 0.4 °C upstream, 7.3 °C
    midstream and 8.2 °C downstream. The annual precipitation decreases rapidly from
    322.1 mm upstream to 130.4 mm midstream and 30.7 mm downstream, while the crop
    reference ET (McVicar et al., 2012) (measured by Chinese micro-pans) increases
    significantly from 954.8 mm to 1324.6 mm and 2248.8 mm in the three reaches respectively

    full-size image Fig. 1. Study region and map of land cover/land use in Heihe River
    Basin, and the LAS observation locations in the upstream, midstream and downstream,
    along with examples of the footprint coverage at daily scale (90%) in the images
    on the right and the MODIS pixels. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental
    Research (HiWATER) was conducted in this region and three key experimental areas
    respectively in the upstream, midstream and downstream were selected for intensive
    and long term observations since 2012 (Li et al., 2013). Here, the tower-based
    flux observation systems consisted of networks of optical large-aperture scintillometers
    (LASs) and eddy covariance (EC) towers that were deployed over grassland in the
    upland, irrigated cropland mixed with sparse residential areas in the midstream
    and sparse riparian shrub-forest in the downstream (Fig. 1). In the upstream,
    a LAS system (BLS450, LAS7) was installed in October 2012 at an elevation higher
    than 3 km above mean sea level, on flux tower platforms. The LAS system measures
    over an alpine meadow along a 2.39 km path and has an effective height of 9.5 m
    above ground level. This allows the beam to cross more than two MODIS pixels.
    In the agricultural plains region, four LAS flux observation systems (LAS1, LAS2,
    LAS3, LAS4) were installed to measure large scale surface fluxes (up to 10 km2)
    over flat irrigated seed maize fields at an elevation higher than 1.5 km above
    mean sea level from May to September 2012. These LAS systems measure over croplands
    with path lengths of 3.3, 2.8, 3.1 and 1.9 km for LAS1 through LAS4, respectively.
    The first three LAS flux observation systems have the same effective height of
    33.45 m above ground level, while LAS4 has an effective height of 22.45 m. The
    LAS1, LAS2 and LAS3 observation systems were dismantled after September 2012,
    but LAS4 system (BLS900) was left to measure the sensible heat flux and its measurements
    were used to evaluate the modeled fluxes. In addition, two LAS systems (BLS900,
    LAS5 and LAS6) were installed over riparian shrub-forest (in the natural oasis
    of the Ejin) at an elevation about 0.9 km near the watershed downstream area starting
    in July of 2013. These two LAS systems measured along a 2.4 km path and have the
    same effective height of 22.5 m above ground level but one LAS system was left
    from May 2015 and its measurements were used to assess the modeled fluxes. These
    long beams allow the LAS systems to measure surface fluxes over several MODIS
    pixels. Along these LAS transects, one or multiple EC and automated weather station
    (AWS) systems were also installed over the dominant land cover types. The EC data
    with sampling frequency of 10 Hz used in partitioning ET into E and T were collected
    at the Daman superstation located in a maize field in 2012 during HiWATER (Liu
    et al., 2016; X. Li et al., 2017; Y. Li et al., 2017). EC systems consisted of
    an open-path infrared gas analyzer (Li-7500A, LiCor Inc., Lincoln,1 Nebraska,
    USA) and a 3-D sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah,
    USA), with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. The sensor data were collected using
    a data logger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah, USA). Estimates
    of E and T using the FVS partitioning method with the EC 10 Hz CO2 and water vapor
    data used the algorithms proposed by Scanlon and Kustas (2010) with refinements
    performed by Skaggs et al. (2018). This method assumes that contributions to the
    EC measured high-frequency time series of water vapor and carbon dioxide concentrations
    derived from stomatal processes and non-stomatal processes separately conform
    to flux-variance similarity and therefore can be separated (Scanlon and Kustas,
    2010; Skaggs et al., 2018). Additionally, an isotropic analyzer measured δ18O
    of atmospheric water vapor and their flux ratios at the Daman superstation in
    2012 during HiWATER also was used to quantify the E from soil and T from the maize
    crop (Wen et al., 2016). Given the measured δ18O of atmospheric water vapor and
    evapotranspiration (δET), the O18 composition of soil evaporation (δE) was computed
    using the Craig-Gordon model (Williams et al., 2004) and that of transpiration
    (δT) was approximated by xylem water near by early afternoon. Finally, the ratio
    of E and T to the total ET can be calculated based on the conservation principles
    with the determined δET, δE, δE (Wen et al., 2016). The collection interval of
    all the LASs was 1-min structure parameter of the refractive index of air Cn2,
    which was then averaged over 30 min periods after careful screening. The main
    quality control steps were as follows: (1) the data were rejected when Cn2 was
    beyond the saturated criterion; (2) Data were rejected when the demodulation signal
    was small; (3) Data were rejected within 1 h of precipitation; (4) Data were rejected
    at night when weak turbulence occurred. Then, the sensible heat flux (H) values
    over heterogeneous areas are derived by combining with the meteorological data
    and based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory as described by Liu et al., 2011,
    Liu et al., 2013. The optical LAS flux observation system can derive the surface
    fluxes of H across a path of several kilometers over a heterogeneous land surface.
    Before evaluating the representativeness of the LAS flux observation system, a
    footprint model was applied to calculate the source area of the flux measurements.
    The detailed theory of the footprint model is described in Liu et al. (2011).
    Fig. 1 shows the flux footprints of the LAS (corresponding to approximately 90%
    of the source area contributing to H) on a daily time scale under different landcover
    conditions in the Heihe River Basin. From Fig. 1, the footprint model indicates
    that the source area of LAS flux observation system covers an area encompassing
    several MODIS pixels (3 × 1 or 2 × 2 MODIS pixels) in the upwind direction, depending
    on LAS instrument height and path length, wind speed/direction, atmospheric stability
    and surface conditions (Bai et al., 2015; Kormann and Meixner, 2001). The optical
    LAS flux observation system can only measure an integrated H over its path length.
    To obtain an estimate of the latent heat flux (LE), spatially representative net
    radiation (Rn) and surface soil heat flux (G) values are required to solve for
    LE as a residual in the surface energy balance, LE = Rn − G − H. In this study,
    the average Rn and G values within the estimated LAS source area/flux footprint
    were obtained from weighting multiple net radiation and soil heat flux measurements
    from the EC systems for the predominant landcover types and/or divided into homogeneous
    landcover zones (Hemakumara et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013;
    Liu et al., 2016). The Rn was measured using model PSP & PIR, sensors (Eppley
    Laboratory, Inc., Newport, Rhode Island, USA) and G measurements were made using
    model HFP01SC sensors (Hukseflux Thermal Sensors, Delftechpark, Delft, Netherlands).
    2.2. Satellite and meteorological data The remote sensing based DTD model can
    be driven by MODIS data products and standard meteorological forcing. Here daytime
    and nighttime land surface temperature maps over the Heihe River Basin were obtained
    from the global 1 km MODIS land surface temperature products (MOD11A1 Terra satellite
    obtained, Collection 5 and MYD11A1 Aqua satellite obtained, Collection 5). However,
    the thermal infrared satellite images are affected by cloud contamination, and
    the cloudy pixels should be masked when generating a LST product. This typically
    results in greater than half the LST data being removed from a scene. To obtain
    a continuous LST time-series a robust gap filling algorithm according to clear-sky
    neighboring pixels was applied to reconstruct cloud-contaminated pixels in MODIS
    daily and night LST products. The details of this gap filling algorithm are described
    in Sun et al. (2017b). Another important model input parameter is leaf area index
    (LAI) which is used in partitioning the LST and surface fluxes between soil and
    canopy. Here, the daily LAI maps over the Heihe River Basin were obtained from
    4-day global 1 km MODIS LAI product (MCD15A3 Terra-Aqua combined, Collection 5)
    and in combination with 8-day global 1 km GLASS LAI product (Xiao et al., 2014)
    used to correct known errors in the MODIS LAI product. The MODIS LAI product was
    temporally smoothed and gap-filled using the TIMESAT algorithm proposed by Jönsson
    and Eklundh (2004). Landsat 8 visible and near-infrared (VNIR) surface reflectance
    and thermal infrared data from 2013 to 2015 used to run TSEB were obtained from
    USGS. Landsat-scale LAI was estimated from Landsat VNIR surface reflectance data
    applying MODIS LAI products as reference (Butscher and Huggenberger, 2009). To
    evaluate the relative utility of the DTD model for estimating ET to other remote
    sensing-based methods, a comparison was conducted with several global ET products.
    These included MOD16A2, BESS-ET and GLASS ET, whose output was acquired over our
    study sites. The MOD16A2 Version 6 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux product
    is an 8-day composite product produced at 500-meter pixel resolution (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/),
    is based on the Penman-Monteith equation. The BESS-ET product uses the Breathing
    Earth System Simulator (BESS) that couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfers,
    canopy photosynthesis, transpiration, and energy balance (Ryu et al., 2011). The
    GLASS ET produced by the Bayesian model averaging which merges five process-based
    ET algorithms (Yao et al., 2014). These algorithms included the MODIS LE products
    (MOD16) (Mu et al., 2011), the Revised remote-sensing-based Penman-Monteith approach
    (RRS-PM) (Yuan et al., 2010), the Priestley-Taylor technique from the Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory, Caltech (PT-JPL) (Fisher et al., 2008), the Modified satellite-based
    Priestley-Taylor method (MS-PT) (Yao et al., 2013), and the Semi-empirical Penman
    scheme of the University of Maryland (UMD-SEMI) (Wang et al., 2010). In this study,
    the standard meteorological forcing including hourly wind speed, air temperature,
    atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and solar radiation were simulated at
    5 km spatial resolution by the WRF (weather research and forecasting) model in
    combination with observations from China Meteorological Administration station
    (Pan et al., 2012). These weather data are freely accessible from the following
    website (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn/data/). 2.3. MODIS remote sensing-based DTD
    model The DTD model implements the TSEB modeling scheme but uses a morning time
    differential radiometric and air temperature to overcome possible systematic bias
    in the temperature retrievals. Although originally designed to be used with geostationary
    satellite or with continuous in situ radiometer data, Guzinski et al. (2013) validated
    its utility with daytime and nighttime MODIS surface temperature products and
    interpolated weather station air temperature observations (Guzinski et al., 2015).
    The DTD model applied to MODIS data can potentially estimate the surface fluxes
    from watershed to regional, continental and even at global scales, while reducing
    the effect of errors associated with the MODIS LST product and coarse spatial
    resolution meteorological forcing. Details of the derivation of the remote sensing
    based DTD model is originally described by Norman et al. (2000) with refinements
    and applications with MODIS data described in Guzinski et al., 2013, Guzinski
    et al., 2014. In the original DTD model, the sensible heat flux (H) can be derived
    with application of Eq. (14) in Anderson et al. (1997): (1) H = T R − T a ρ c
    ρ − f θ ⋅ H c ⋅ r a 1 − f θ r a + r s + H c where TR is the satellite derived
    directional surface temperature (K), Ta is the air temperature (K), f(θ) is the
    vegetation fraction observed by the satellite sensor over a zenith angle θ, ra
    is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in air above the canopy (m s−1),
    rs in the resistance to heat flow in the boundary immediately above the soil surface
    (m s−1), ρ is the air density (kg m−3), cp is the heat capacity of air (J kg−1 K−1).
    To improve the DTD model, the resistance network to sensible heat flux was replaced
    with the series TSEB scheme, which allows for iteration between the soil and canopy,
    with the following formulation: (2) T R − T a = H 1 − f θ r s + r a ρ c p + H
    c f θ r x − ( 1 − f θ r s ρ c p If we can obtain two times remote sensing LST
    products and meteorological data during a day, the first time is t0 and the second
    time is ti, then the Eq. (1) can be applied twice, and H can express as (Guzinski
    et al., 2014): (3) H i = ρ c ρ T R , i θ i − T R , 0 θ 0 − T a , i − T a , 0 1
    − f θ i r s , i + r a , i + H c , i 1 − f θ i r s , i − f θ i r x , i 1 − f θ

    , i + H c , 0 f θ 0 r x , 0 − 1 − f θ 0 r s , 0 1 − f θ i r s , i + r a , i In
    the original DTD model scheme, the t0 observation is taken to be 1 h after the
    sunrise, the heat flux for soil surface Hs,0 = H0 − Hc,0 and Hc,0 are minimal
    and can be negligible (Norman et al., 2000). Here the nighttime observation was
    used instead of the observation one hour after the sunrise, for the energy fluxes
    are small they only cause minimal influence in the daytime flux estimation, and
    sometime even showed improvement by this adjustment (Guzinski et al., 2013). While
    the night fluxes could be assumed to be negligible, the MODIS night-day LST based
    DTD can be simplified as: (4) H i = ρ c ρ T R , i θ i − T R , 0 θ 0 − T a , i
    − T a , 0 1 − f θ i r s , i + r a , i ) + H c , i 1 − f θ i r s , i − f θ i r
    x , i 1 − f θ i r s , i + r a , i and Hci is constrained by canopy energy budget,
    (5) H ci = Rn ci 1 − α PT f G Δ Δ + γ Then the total latent heat flux, LEi, at
    i time can be calculated as a residual of the surface energy balance equation
    (Gi being the ground heat flux), (7) LE i = Rn i − G i − H i and the latent heat
    flux of soil LEsi also can be calculated as a residual, (8) LE si = LE i − LE
    ci The TSEB model net radiation equations (Eqs. (9), (10)) for soil and canopy
    net radiation, namely Rnsi and Rnci come from the formulation of (Kustas and Norman,
    1999) at time i. (9) Rn = si τ longwave L ↓ i + 1 − τ longwave ε c σ T ci 4 −

    si 4 − 2 ε c σ T ci 4 + 1 − τ solar 1 − α c S ↓ where ε, α, are the emissivity
    and albedo, respectively; the subscripts c and s refer to the canopy and soil,
    respectively. S↓ and L↓i are the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation (W m−2)
    from the sky, τlongwave and τsolar are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances
    through the canopy, respectively. To estimate the component surface fluxes from
    the soil and vegetation, the Priestley-Taylor and parallel resistance formulations
    are combined, and the initial vegetation temperature is computed as (Norman et
    al., 1995): (11) T ci = T a + Rn c r AH ρ C p 1 − α PT f G Δ Δ + γ where Tci is
    the initial estimate of Tc, Ta is the air temperature at the reference height,
    rAH is the aerodynamic resistance to turbulent heat transport between the canopy
    source height and the reference height (W m−2). The value of αPT for the canopy
    transpiration under non-stressed conditions is assumed to have a value ~1.26 derived
    from the original Priestley-Taylor formulation (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), except
    perhaps under well-watered vegetation cover conditions in strongly advective environments
    where αPT may approach a value on the order of 2 (Kustas and Norman, 1999). The
    variable fG is the fraction of green vegetation, Δ is the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure versus temperature curve and γ is the psychrometric constant of
    ~0.06. Once Tc is computed, soil temperature is derived using the Stefan-Boltzmann
    law for the soil and vegetation system via Eq. (1). Under canopy stress conditions,
    using a αc value of ~1.26 can result in an elevated canopy temperature, then lower-derived
    Ts-values and hence LEs < 0, which under daytime conditions is clearly not a physical
    solution. Under such conditions, the model iteratively reduces the initial αc
    until LEs > 0 (see Anderson et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2005) for details). The
    soil heat flux, G at 0 and i time when the MODIS satellite overpass are modeled
    according to the scheme proposed by Santanello and Friedl (2003): (12) G 0 = Rn
    s a ⋅ cos 2 π b t + c where t is the solar time angle (in seconds), and a, b,
    and c are constants that define the maximum ratio (a = 0.30) and the shape and
    phase shift of the sinusoidal curve (b = 80,000 s, and c = 3600 s) (Colaizzi et
    al., 2012). The instantaneous soil and canopy latent heat fluxes estimated at
    MODIS overpass time are then upscaled to daily ET using the ratio of instantaneous
    to daily insolation approach (Cammalleri et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2017a), using
    the following equations (13) f SUN = LE i / R si (14) LE id = f SUN × R sid where
    LEi and Rsi are the instantaneous latent heat and insolation for soil or vegetation
    at satellite overpass time, while LEid and Risd are the daily total fluxes. Finally,
    the daily latent heat fluxes were converted to daily E and T (mm) by dividing
    by the coefficient of latent heat vaporization λ. One key aspect in DTD (as well
    as in TSEB) is the assumption of initial potential transpiration and its sensitivity
    to the αPT and/or fG. In our case, since the retrieval of fG is challenging, and
    a robust method for its estimation is still needed, we assumed a constant fG of
    1, which is likely to contribute to errors in ET estimates later in the growing
    season as the vegetation undergoes senescence. 2.4. Spatial characterization Although
    the source areas of LAS measurement can cover several kilometers, they are not
    necessarily representative of the model output from one/several coarse satellite
    pixels. This means that if the mean flux value from several pixels was directly
    compared with the in situ measurements, it is likely to introduce uncertainties
    for strongly heterogeneous surfaces when there is a spatial mismatch between the
    model output and LAS source area. To understand the intrinsic properties of the
    land surface in the MODIS pixels, high-resolution surface latent heat fluxes estimated
    using TSEB model and Landsat 8 image data were applied to assess the degree of
    spatial representativeness between a given LAS measurement source area and the
    surrounding land surface extending to the MODIS pixel resolution. The semivariogram,
    a widely used geostatistical tool, was applied to quantitatively describe the
    spatial variability of land surface conditions (Román et al., 2009) and the spatial
    representativeness of the LAS measurements by using the finer resolution Landsat-based
    LE estimated by TSEB model across the MODIS pixels. In this study, the semivariogram
    was used to obtain the average squared semi-difference between the ET values which
    are within certain distance bins defined by multiples of 30 m (the spatial resolution
    of a Landsat 8 pixel). (15) r h = 1 2 N h ∑ i = 1 N h z x i − z x i + h 2 where
    r(h) is the variogram estimator between the ET that are within the certain distance
    h. zx is the ET at pixel location x, and zx+h is the ET at another pixel within
    a lag distance h, N(h) is the number of pairs within this distance. Here the spherical,
    Gaussian and exponential models are used to fit the variogram model parameters,
    such as range, sill and nugget effect to the variogram estimator: Spherical (16)
    r sph = c 0 + c ⋅ 1.5 ⋅ h a − 0.5 h a 3 for 0 ≤ h ≤ a c 0 + c for h > a Gaussian
    (17) r h = c 0 + c 1 − e − h a h > 0 Exponential (18) r h = c 0 + c 1 − e − h
    a 2 h > 0 The range (a) describes the average patch size of the land surface where
    there is no further correlation of water and heat flux conditional property associated
    with a point. The sill (c) describes the maximum semivariance, which is the ordinate
    value of range where the variogram levels off to an asymptote while the lag (h)
    goes to infinity. The nugget effect (c0) describes the offset variance value of
    the variogram at h = 0. Here, smaller sill values indicate a more homogenous water
    and energy flux spatial distribution condition. This would mean that the LAS measurements
    are more spatially representative and more appropriate to be used to validate
    the remotely sensed ET products even if the flux footprints only represent a fraction
    of the MODIS pixel. On the other hand, the spatial representative of LAS measurements
    is reduced with the increasing sill values, and hence larger uncertainty may be
    introduced when applying these measurements to evaluate the remotely sensed ET
    products at MODIS resolution. 3. Results 3.1. Representativeness of measurements
    One of the main objectives of this study is to produce continuous spatio-temporal
    remotely-sensed ET estimates, and its components of E and T, at watershed scale.
    As a secondary objective, this study aimed also to develop approaches to validate
    MODIS-derived estimations of the ET based on measurements from LAS towers, which
    can represent a much larger footprint compared to EC towers. However, the model-measurement
    comparison not only depends on the quality of LAS data but also on the heterogeneity
    of the source area of integrated by the LAS instrument and the representativeness
    of the available energy (Rn-G) which at the MODIS coarse pixel resolution is assumed
    to be homogeneous. By applying the variogram to the finer resolution Landsat based
    estimates of LE using the TSEB model, the within pixel heterogeneity of the MODIS-based
    output of ET could be assessed. In other words, the finer pixel output from TSEB
    could be selected and aggregated according to source area of LAS system (see Fig.
    1) (Hoedjes et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2016; Román et al., 2009). The results of
    the variogram analysis indicates that the ET is relatively homogeneous over an
    extended region at the midstream site, but the upstream and downstream sites are
    more spatially complex and heterogeneous during the growing season. Smaller sill
    value indicates a more homogenous moisture state suggesting that the observations
    are representative of a significantly greater area than just the flux tower footprint.
    This also means that ET was relatively homogenous at the scale of LAS source-area
    resolutions which also correspond to the MODIS pixel size. At the midstream site
    smaller values of semivariance computed for Landsat derived ET existed over much
    of the growing season except very early in the season. However, the upstream and
    downstream sites are more spatially heterogeneous during the growing season and
    hence the LAS measurements are less representative of ET flux at the MODIS resolution.
    Fig. 2 shows relatively high semivariance values in early season at upstream site
    followed by lower rates in the mid-season, and then to extremely small values
    at the end of the growing season. This means the surface conditions are more homogeneous
    towards the end of the growing season for the grassland-dominated upstream and
    ET becomes more uniform since variability in cover and moisture have less impact
    on ET. Download : Download high-res image (1012KB) Download : Download full-size

    Land surface fluxes estimated from MODIS based DTD model for the satellite overpass
    times, averaged over the LAS tower footprint are compared to LAS estimates of
    available energy (Rn-G) upscaled from ground point measurements (Fig. 3), direct
    measurements of H (Fig. 4) and LE (Fig. 5) computed as a residual during the MODIS
    acquisition dates. At all the upstream, midstream and downstream sites in the
    Heihe River Basin, the DTD model estimates of the flux components Rn-G, H and
    LE fall generally along the one-to-one line with the LAS estimates during the
    growing season. The difference statistics between modeled and observed surface

    and measured heat fluxes existed at the midstream site mainly covered predominately
    by maize than for the upstream and downstream sites, which are mainly covered
    by grassland and mixed forest, respectively. The DTD model tend to have higher
    values of Rn-G and LE in both upstream and midstream sites, and slightly lower
    values of Rn-G, H and LE for downstream site. The scatter between modeled and
    measured H is particularly troublesome, and may be due in part to the small variability
    in H and size source area sampled by the LAS sensors within the larger MODIS pixel.
    For LE, DTD yielded a mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD) value of 28%, 16%
    and 22% for the upstream, midstream and downstream sites, respectively when compared
    with LE calculated from ground measurements. This is encouraging given that Rn-G
    is derived from several point samples on the ground and is not likely to be fully
    representative of the values for a whole MODIS pixel. The higher MAPD values for
    H relative to Rn-G and LE are due in part to the overall smaller range in H values
    The highest values of MAPD for H is at the midstream site caused by many extremely
    low H values from the irrigated densely vegetated maize fields which are often
    affected by significant advection of heat from the surrounding dryland region
    (Song et al., 2016). When applying the model under cloudy conditions, the estimated
    fluxes were derived using the reconstructed MODIS LST according to clear-sky neighboring
    pixels from nearby data and adjustment factors that involve the distance and similarity
    between the absent and neighboring pixels. Scatterplot of in situ surface heat
    fluxes including Rn-G, H and LE and modeled surface heat fluxes for both clear
    and cloudy days are also provided in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5. Not surprisingly,
    the agreement between MODIS based DTD model output and the flux observations is
    better on clear days, having lower scatter, than under cloudy days where the input
    of LST had to be derived from spatial interpolation. Table 2 lists the difference
    statistics for daily ET estimated from the DTD model at MODIS coarse pixels versus
    ground measurements, including both clear days and cloudy days. The MODIS based
    DTD model yielded larger daily ET values at upstream and midstream with the mean
    bias values of 0.69 and 0.40 mm/day, respectively, while smaller daily ET values
    were computed for downstream site in Heihe River Basin. MAPD for daily ET estimates
    are slightly greater than for the instantaneous estimates, with significant large
    value of 46% at upstream but lower values of 29% and 28%, respectively at midstream
    and downstream. However, the model performed significantly better under clearly
    sky condition at upstream and midstream sites, with MAPD values of 27% and 15%,
    respectively. Table 2. Statistical results of modeled vs measured daily ET at
    upstream, midstream and downstream sites in Heihe watershed. Empty Cell Area Mean

    3.1 −0.04 30% 1.2 0.34 The larger errors of daily ET time series for the upstream
    area are associated with the frequent rain events. The MODIS LST spatial interpolation
    is likely to add additional noise when applying these data to estimate surface
    heat fluxes for the cloudy days. The average modeled and measured coarse scale
    ET in grasslands in the upstream, croplands in the midstream and the riparian
    shrub-forests in the downstream regions were between 3 and 4 mm/day, with higher
    rate of water consumption for the riparian shrub-forest and cropland than the
    grassland. The DTD ET product significantly outperformed the global remote sensing
    ET products (8 day) which included MOD16A2, BESS-ET and GLASS for the 2014 growing
    season (see Table 3). Moreover, the daily ET product from DTD was comparable or
    had slightly better accuracy than reported in studies using these other remote
    sensing models (X. Li et al., 2017; Y. Li et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2015; Wang
    et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018). In addition, with DTD there is estimation of
    ET partitioning between E and T which is useful information for detecting plant
    stress and improving water use efficiency. In the MOD16A2 algorithm, the stomatal
    conductance is restricted by the VPD (Mu et al., 2011), while the plant is always
    under unstressed condition in the agricultural areas even when the VPD value is
    elevated. Consequently, application of this algorithm over irrigated agriculture
    in arid regions is likely to result in an underestimation of canopy conductance,
    which will lead to the underestimation of transpiration and ET. (Yang et al.,
    2015). This is also the case for BESS-ET since it makes use of the MOD16A2 algorithm
    to produce ET (Ryu et al., 2011). For the GLASS ET performance was slightly better
    since this scheme merged several different model output (an ensemble) which tends
    to yield a more reliable output in the ensemble than any individual model (Yao
    et al., 2014). Table 3. Statistical results of modeled vs measured daily ET under

    of observed and modeled daily ET at coarse scale for 2012–2015 growing seasons
    under grassland, cropland and shrub-forest cover conditions are shown in Fig.
    6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8. In these plots, the observed ET is computed from LAS measurements
    of H and multiple tower measurements of Rn and G computing LE by residual. The
    modeled values represent a spatial average over all 1-km pixels within the given
    LAS footprint area. The observed seasonal ET showed very similar patterns for
    the growing season, where ET values increased rapidly in the early growing season,
    reached the maximum in the mid-July and then declined gradually starting at the
    end of July as plants matured and then began to go into the seeding and subsequent
    senescent stage. The remotely sensed LAI computed from NDVI will decrease in response
    to plant senescence but the uncertainty in the total LAI (the contributions from
    both the green and senescent plant material) is likely to increase in the later
    part of the season affecting DTD model performance. The seasonal modeled and observed
    ET patterns also fluctuated greatly on the rainy days due to the absence of high
    levels of solar radiation and low atmospheric demand. The number of rainy days
    decreased from the wetter upstream site to the generally drier downstream area
    within the Heihe River Basin. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    period (2013–2015). Fig. 6, Fig. 7 illustrate the similarity in model performance
    between grassland and irrigated cropland in the Heihe River Basin during the growing
    season under clear sky conditions. Here, the modeled ET closely tracked the seasonal
    dynamics of field water consumption derived from solving LE as a residual using
    daily LAS H measurements together with multiple flux tower observations of Rn-G.
    In contrast, the model showed a much stronger response to the rainfall events,
    producing a significant overestimation of daily ET when compared with LAS measurements
    on days where rain occurred. These discrepancies caused by the large precipitation
    events contribute to a major part of the MAPD statistic during model evaluation
    especially at the upstream site where there was frequent cloud cover and rainfall
    events during the growing season. On the other hand, there are larger discrepancies
    at the downstream site containing the riparian shrub-tree even though this location
    showed a lower cloud cover frequency. The greater model-measurement discrepancies
    is due in part to underestimation of daily solar radiation simulated by WRF when
    interpolating the instantaneous modeled LE to daily ET combined with the significant
    heterogeneity in moisture state as indicated by the semivariogram analysis. A
    more extensive assessment of DTD model T and E partitioning was conducted using
    the ratio of T/ET and E/ET estimated from the FVS partitioning method (Skaggs
    et al., 2018) and estimated from isotopic technology (Wen et al., 2016), respectively,
    at the midstream site during the HiWATER experiment (June to September in 2012).
    The T/ET and E/ET values from the DTD model are in good agreement with those derived
    from the isotope approach for the entire growing season (Fig. 9). On the other
    hand, the DTD model yielded T/ET and E/ET values that were approximately 10% higher
    and lower, respectively, than estimated by the FVS partitioning method, and there
    is greater scatter in comparison to the isotope method. Download : Download high-res

    (a) T/ET% and (b) E/ET% values from DTD with the ground measurement data using
    the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic and high-frequency EC data using FVS flux
    partitioning method. Greater discrepancies in the partitioning between modeled
    and the two measurement techniques occurred under rainy or cloudy day conditions
    and later in the season where the vegetation was undergoing senescence. These
    conditions generally led to a larger estimate of T relative to E from DTD model
    compared with the FVS partitioning method. The season trends in T/ET and E/ET
    over the cropland area given by the DTD model follow the temporal trend in LAI.
    There is gradual increase T/ET from the early growing season followed by a plateau
    in these values during the middle season and then rapid decreases associated with
    the leaf senescence resulting in decreasing crop LAI towards harvest. The day-to-day
    fluctuations in T/ET and E/ET estimated from both DTD and the FVS flux partitioning
    method was mainly associated with variations in solar radiation forcing (cloudiness)
    and atmospheric demand. The isotropic technique had less variability perhaps due
    to more restrictions on what data was acceptable for estimating the partitioning.
    3.4. Spatial patterns and statistics in evaporation and transpiration during growing
    season Spatial patterns at coarse scale of monthly E and T over the Heihe watershed
    during the growing season are varied and complex for the diverse land cover and
    climate conditions. Fig. 10 demonstrates the variability in monthly cumulative
    E and T from the modeled daily values through the whole Heihe watershed from June
    to September 2013. In the early season (June), T values are greater for the cropland
    in the midstream and woodlands while its values are relatively uniformly distributed
    over the other surfaces including the grasslands and desert. The higher T rates
    for the cropland at the midstream, and forest and shrub at the upstream are associated
    with the maize seeding in the later May, followed by irrigation, and tree leafing
    out later in the spring. In July and August, vegetation water use increases rapidly
    since over these two months the highest rate of vegetation growth and biomass
    accumulation occurs. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    under different land cover conditions over Heihe river basin. Where the blank
    areas are bare soil and deserts, and the LAI estimated from MODIS is set to zero.
    There are several identifiable cases with greatest T rates accumulation under
    oasis irrigation districts in the Ganzhou district, Linze, Gaotai, Jinta, Jiuquan,
    and others, in the midstream. T variations between irrigation districts can be
    the result of different crop types or may relate to different irrigation scheduling.
    In addition, the forest, shrub and grass distributed along the upstream river
    also show high water consumption during this peak vegetation growth period. Here
    the T variation is associated with the magnitude of vegetation biomass and leaf
    area for the different vegetation types. Later in the season, from about early
    September, the vegetation undergoes senescence resulting in generally lower water
    use by the vegetation within the Heihe watershed. The irrigation districts in
    the midstream have a distinctly greater T rate than at the upstream region, which
    includes forests, shrubs and alpine meadows, having slightly lower vegetation
    biomass, and followed by even lower T rates at the downstream area which is a
    natural oasis site covered by a sparse riparian shrub-forest ecosystem. The greatest
    T rate in the irrigation districts is associated with the densest plant biomass
    and abundant plant available water via flood irrigation, which was applied four
    times during the growing season. In addition, the high temporal frequency of clear-skies
    and high evaporative demand also accelerated the water consumption by the crops.
    However, in the upstream, with similar dense vegetation coverage, the higher temporal
    frequency of rainfall and cloudy-skies tends to reduce vegetation water use due
    to generally lower daily available energy (Rn-G). While in the downstream, the
    low flows from the Heihe River due to significant withdrawals for irrigation by
    the midstream region, together with the very little precipitation exacerbates
    the limited water available for this area. As a result, this causes water stress
    conditions to sometimes exist in this part of the watershed, suggesting that additional
    available water is required, especially during drought, to maintain a healthy
    shrub-forest ecosystem. The magnitude of E/ET for the Heihe river basin is relatively
    high, >65%. This is because much of the basin is largely (84%) comprised of semi-arid
    and arid sparse vegetation cover (see Fig. 1). In the early growing season, the
    vegetation coverage is relatively low in the upstream and midstream but there
    is a high soil moisture content, resulting in large evaporation rates from the
    soil surface. However, the E rate decreased gradually in the middle of the growing
    season due to rapid plant growth that significantly increases the interception
    of incoming solar radiation and attenuation of wind so that little radiation and
    wind reach the soil surface. This in turn leads to limited radiation and turbulent
    exchange at the soil surface and hence, small E rates. The monthly E and T rates
    under different landcovers during the growing season in the Heihe River Basin
    are illustrated in Fig. 11, which were calculated according to the landuse and
    landcover map. The monthly accumulated T values increased rapidly in the early
    growing season and then reached a peak in July. The crops consumed most of the
    water because they have high leaf area index, shading much of the soil surface,
    and a fully developed rooting system accessing irrigated water through the soil
    profile, which remained at a high moisture content due to frequent irrigation
    and rainfall. The next highest level of T values is obtained for wetlands, forests
    and shrubs, while the alpine meadow yielded the lowest plant water use. The ability
    for photosynthesis and transpiration for the different canopies declined greatly
    in September when they began to undergo senescence. However, the E rates from
    the soil surface have small fluctuations that is affected by the variable solar
    irradiance, vegetation cover, and soil moisture content. The E values for soil
    surfaces covered by moderate canopy density deceased gradually from June to September
    as the solar irradiance reduced and the vegetation cover grew. Here, the E rates
    for semiarid sparsely vegetated surfaces also have a similar variability to the
    areas with more vegetation, which may be due to the sparse plant cover in the
    desert. However, deriving canopy fraction and a canopy temperature related to
    estimating T for the semi-arid site is very difficult at such coarse MODIS resolutions.
    In addition, MODIS LAI product for the desert/semi-arid sites often would provide
    LAI values essentially equal to zero, which often is not the case and had to be
    corrected based on the GLASS LAI product. Download : Download high-res image (834KB)

    irrigated agricultural areas and heterogeneous surface may not be an ideal test
    case for both measurement and modeling of ET using LST, they are having a major
    impact on water resources in many regions world-wide, particularly those that
    are water-limited. The discrepancies between ET measurements (both LAS and EC)
    and ET receives using LST are caused by several factors which include uncertainty
    in LST and vegetation cover, key boundary condition for the thermal-infrared ET
    models. For EC and LAS measurements, advection and surface heterogeneity cause
    uncertainty in ET observations. However, there are also issues related to the
    mismatch in spatial resolution between the remote sensing model output which is
    restricted by the pixel resolution and the spatial representativeness of the flux
    measurements. Depending on the model resolution, this involves upscaling the tower-based
    EC measurements of ET, the available energy term using LAS measurements of sensible
    heat flux to derive ET or microwave LAS measurements of ET. For many landscapes
    this is a significant challenge when combined with the uncertainty in flux footprint
    models for validating model output (Li et al., 2018a, Li et al., 2018b; Liu et
    al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). These issues are discussed in greater detail below.
    4.1. Issues of model limitation There is a significant scatter in the comparison
    scatterplots of H from DTD model and LAS measurements. This may be introduced
    by the issues related to the representativeness of MODIS resolution output of
    DTD model and the LAS measurements, or by the limitation of the TSEB and its single
    set of resistant parameterizations for various landscapes. To understand the poor
    performance of DTD model under heterogeneous land surface conditions, the finer
    30 m resolution of remotely sensed H and Rn-G were estimated using the TSEB model
    in combination with Landsat images during the growing season from 2013 to 2015
    and the pixels within the footprint of the LAS sensors were aggregated. The aggregated
    H and Rn-G values were compared with the LAS measured H and average Rn and G values
    (Fig. 12) within their footprint at the upstream, midstream and downstream, respectively.
    In Fig. 12 there tends be lower scatter compared with Fig. 4, which suggests there
    may be a lack of equivalence in the representativeness of DTD output with LAS
    source area/flux footprint. Download : Download high-res image (298KB) Download

    LAS observation and estimates aggregated from Landsat based TSEB model output
    on satellite overpass times for the upstream, midstream and downstream sites in
    the Heihe river basin. But the general underestimation of H from TSEB model was
    still observed particularly for the downstream site. This may be due in part to
    the use of the Priestley-Taylor assumption with fG = 1 while the canopy had undergone
    senescence (Guzinski et al., 2013; Guzinski et al., 2014; Song et al., 2016).
    Another contributing factor could be the underestimation of the LAI under high
    land surface temperature conditions. At higher LAI with the same elevated land
    surface temperature can result in a reduction in the Priestley-Taylor term indicating
    vegetation stress conditions. Additionally, under this natural oasis-desert system
    with native plants adapted to arid environments, the defined Priestley-Taylor
    coefficient α or the fG may be generally lower (Agam et al., 2010; Kustas et al.,
    2016). However, in the DTD model, the Priestley-Taylor coefficient αPT for the
    vegetated canopy is normally set to an initial value equal to 1.26, and there
    is a procedure in place that can incrementally reduce αPT to account for water-limited
    conditions. However, there is no a priori methodology for increasing αPT under
    well-watered advective conditions (Kustas and Norman, 1999). In this study, the
    midstream area is in an oasis-desert ecosystem, where well-irrigated cropland
    will be strongly influenced by heat advection from the surrounding desert area.
    The influence of strong advection can result in the value of αPT exceeding 1.26,
    especially during mid-season. However, since the DTD model is unable to automatically
    adjust (increase) αPT for this condition, this explains in part the increased
    scatter between modeled and observed H and LE for the midstream area. 4.2. The
    spatial representativeness of ground measurement The comparison between observed
    and MODIS estimated daily ET showed good agreement for midstream site under clear-sky
    days in Fig. 7 which may be associated with better spatial representativeness
    of LAS measurements at MODIS resolution given the lower variogram range (Román
    et al., 2010; Román et al., 2009). Additionally, the values of semivariance and
    variogram range over the extended region at 1.5 × 2.5 km are also smaller during
    the growing season. Consequently, the MODIS derived instantaneous heat flux and
    daily ET can be assessed directly by applying the ground measurements from LAS
    tower except during of rainfall events (described in Section 4.2). At the midstream
    site, the soil moisture and heat flux conditions are more heterogeneous during
    the early growing season, which is indicated by the higher value of semivariance
    calculated using Landsat-estimated surface latent heat flux on June 22th in 2014.
    This could partly explain the larger discrepancy between the ground measurements
    and MODIS estimated daily ET in the early growing season over the four years (Liu
    et al., 2016). For agricultural areas containing a patchwork of fields of irrigated
    crops with areas of hot and dry bare soil, however, the footprints of LAS a s
    well as MODIS pixels have significant subpixel heterogeneity (Bai et al., 2015;
    Jia et al., 2012). This could compromise the spatial representativeness of both
    the model output and the LAS measurements and thus reduce the reliability in validating
    the MODIS coarse scale ET products using the ground-based LAS observations. As
    the spatial representativeness improves with the decrease in semivariance, the
    assessment of MODIS ET products using the ground observation should be more robust.
    Over the riparian shrub-forest, values of the semivariance remain at the highest
    level during the growing season, and hence the water and heat fluxes are more
    heterogeneous which is likely to significantly deteriorate the spatial representativeness
    of the LAS measurements (Jia et al., 2012). Additionally, there is a mismatch
    between the source area of ground observation and the 2 × 1 MODIS pixels (Liu
    et al., 2016) (Fig.1). This could account in part for the discrepancy between
    the MODIS derived daily ET consisting of a mixture of natural oasis and surrounded
    desert landscape and the LAS measurements representing mainly the ET from the
    natural oasis. 4.3. Uncertainty introduced by measurement and model inputs To
    ensure the high quality of LAS measurements, measured sensible heat flux data
    were rejected when the demodulation signal was small and/or was collected within
    1 h before or after rainfall events. This results in a significant number of missing
    data, especially in wet regions such as the upstream of Heihe River Basin with
    abundant precipitation. The absence of LAS sensible heat flux data required temporal
    interpolation of available energy using the nonlinear regression relationship
    between the area-averaged observed net radiations derived by multiple flux tower
    measurements. Then the large scale latent heat flux was computed applying the
    surface energy balance model. However, errors in daily ET on the order of 5% to
    as high as 15% under extreme conditions (Hui et al., 2004; Novick et al., 2009),
    are introduced with this applied data gap filling methodology (Falge et al., 2001).
    These errors will contribute to the discrepancies between the modeled and observed
    daily ET. The longer gaps caused by the higher rainfall frequency will likely
    exacerbate the difference between the modeled and measured daily ET at the upstream
    sites (Fig. 3). The regression method may work well when the relationship between
    the net radiation and sensible heat flux data is robust, but the absence of significant
    correlation in their relationship can add much noise in the gap filled data. The
    nonlinear regression relationship was developed using observed data under fair
    weather conditions (mostly clear sky), hence it is be able to produce the mean
    flux densities under these conditions (Hui et al., 2004). Thus for days with variable
    cloudiness or rainy weather where there is a much greater variability in flux
    magnitudes than under clear-sky conditions, these interpolations are highly unreliable.
    Finally, the length of the time used to gap fill due to rainfall or poor weather
    conditions also is significant and will cause greater uncertainty in the observed
    fluxes. The MODIS based DTD model reduced the sensitivity to errors of input remote
    sensing surface temperature data (Norman et al., 2000), but using land surface
    temperature not representative of the flux measurement footprint can result in
    significant discrepancies with the observation (Kustas et al., 2012; Tang et al.,
    2011). Moreover, the cloud-contaminated pixels of MODIS land surface temperature
    products are reconstructed using the underplot approach developed based on the
    clear-sky neighboring pixels from nearby dates. However, significant uncertainty
    is likely introduced when there are longer time gaps and large area of cloud obscured
    pixels in the images (Alfieri et al., 2017). This will result in a higher degree
    of scatter between the modeled and observed fluxes as is evident in Fig. 3, Fig.
    4, Fig. 5. These suggest that more accurate model inputs under all-weather conditions
    such as in combining land surface temperature derived from Ka-band microwave data
    under cloudy conditions could improve model performance (Duan et al., 2017; Holmes
    et al., 2015). 5. Conclusion Multi-year daily ET maps in a semi-arid region were
    generated using MODIS-based DTD model. The remotely sensed daily ET was assessed
    at MODIS satellite pixel scale using the LAS measurements under different landcovers
    including grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest. Differences with the
    LAS estimates of daily ET were generally within 20%. The daily ET estimates from
    DTD were also compared to several global scale ET models and shown to be superior.
    These results support the utility of the DTD modeling approach as a potential
    tool for developing a more effective watershed irrigation management and a water
    resource strategy for water allocations to agricultural, commercial and environmental
    uses. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: 1. The MODIS-based DTD model
    performed best over croplands and on clear days when compared with ground measurements.
    Additionally, the modeled spatially-distributed time series of daily ET for the
    cropland, grassland and riparian shrub-forest ecosystems show interesting details
    of water use variability during the growing season. Generally, acceptable instantaneous
    LE estimates from 2012 to 2015 growing season at 1-km spatial resolution in Heihe
    River Basin were obtained using MODIS-based DTD model under all weather conditions.
    However, heterogeneous nature of the landscape and the representativeness of LAS
    measurements compared to the resolution of MODIS-based DTD output was investigated
    using finer pixel resolution Landsat data. These factors were shown to contribute
    to the measured-modeled discrepancies in surface fluxes for some land cover conditions.
    This spatial mismatch between the measured and modeled fluxes was especially apparent
    for the downstream shrub-forest and desert land covers existing in the MODIS pixel.
    2. Despite the observed limitations, the river basin scale daily ET from the MODIS-based
    DTD model significantly outperformed the three other global ET models. Moreover,
    the E and T estimates derived using the MODIS-based DTD model in combination with
    meteorology data, provide some insight to daily plant water use for the different
    landscapes vegetation types. This information can be utilized by water managers
    to better allocate limited water resource between agroecosystems and natural ecosystems
    in a more sustainable way fostering agricultural development while maintaining
    ecosystem functioning. Although decisions regarding allocation of water resources
    depend on multiple factors, including economic impacts, population growth and
    environmental sustainability, daily T and E maps can provide a more comprehensive
    measurement of how efficiently water is used for plant biomass production and
    ultimately crop yield versus the soil which provides little if any benefit to
    increasing production. This information could be used to improve irrigation and
    water conservation techniques in the irrigated agricultural areas. 3. Model produced
    ET estimates at MODIS satellite pixel scale are being compared to direct ET observations
    from microwave LAS systems and from a network of EC flux tower systems. However
    further refinements/improvements to remote sensing-based ET models will require
    more reliable inputs of meteorological forcing, and better tracking of plant phenology,
    such as more accurate determination of the seasonal progression of the actively
    transpiring vegetation or green fraction, fG. In addition, methodologies for measuring
    E and T contributions at coarse satellite resolutions (1 km) (e.g., Scanlon and
    Kustas, 2012) is needed before remote sensing-based methods estimating E and T
    can be adequately tested. Acknowledgments We thank all the scientists, engineers,

    interpolation The cloudy MODIS LST reconstruction approach proposed by Sun et
    al. (2017b), is based on assumption that the LST difference between nearby pixels
    is small during a short time period. For two clear-sky neighboring pixels with
    the same weather conditions, the their LST recorded at the satellite overpass
    time on day t0 can be expressed as, (A1) LST x 0 y 0 t 0 = LST x 1 y 1 t 0 + ε
    0 where (x0, y0), (x1, y1) are the locations of two nearby pixels, t0 is satellite
    observation date, ɛ0 is the LST difference between two pixels. Similarly, on the
    next day, t1: (A2) LST x 0 y 0 t 0 = LST x 1 y 1 t 1 + ε 1 where ɛ1 is the LST
    difference on day t1. Both of the ɛ0 and ɛ1 should be close to zero while the
    land surface is homogenous. And the ɛ0 can be assumed close to ɛ1 even under heterogeneous
    surface under similar weather conditions. With this assumption, if LST at location
    (x0, y0) is absent at day t0, it can be calculated as: (A3) LST x 0 y 0 t 0 ≈
    LST x 0 y 0 t 1 + LST x 1 y 1 t 0 − LST x 1 y 1 t 1 The LST for a missing central
    pixel (x0, y0) on day t0 can be interpolated with a weighting function, in combination
    with additional information from neighboring valid pixels. (A4) LST x 0 y 0 t
    0 = ∑ p = 1 8 ∑ i = 1 N W i LST x 0 y 0 t p + LST x 1 y 1 t 0 − LST x 1 y 1 t
    p − CF (A5) W i = 1 / D i ⋅ S i ∑ i = 1 N 1 / D i ⋅ S i where Wi is a weighting
    function, Di is the distance factor and Si is the environment similarity factor,
    CF is the cloud correction factor, here, it is defined according to the difference
    of the red band reflectance between the cloudy and clear sky conditions. p is
    the day of the comparison image, i is the position of a valid neighboring pixel,
    and N represents the total number of valid pixels selected from 9 × 9 pixels''
    window for each date p. We not only use valid pixels from the nearest day, but
    also from the 8 days surrounding the target reconstruction date to increase sample
    size. Due to a dearth of reliable land surface temperature measurements with a
    source area about 1 km in our study area, the MODIS LST was evaluated with the
    radiometric surface temperatures calculated from four-component radiation measurements
    (Fig. A1). The results showed that the remote sensing LST products with RMSEs
    of 3.4 K, 2.3 K and 3.8 K under grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest,
    respectively, compared with the radiometric temperatures in Heihe River Basin.

    \ population and rising living standards are increasing the\ndemand for agricultural\
    \ products. Under higher pressure over natural resources, environmental\nconcerns\
    \ are increasing as well, challenging current water use decision-making processes\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. Higher agricultural productivity means water should\
    \ be applied more eﬃciently, which\nrequires instant information on weather, soil,\
    \ and plant conditions throughout the growing season.\nAn information-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling application tightened to the spatiotemporal variability of\nthe ﬁelds\
    \ is critical for enhancing the current irrigation system and making better irrigation\
    \ scheduling\ndecisions. The aim of this study is to review current irrigation\
    \ scheduling methodologies based on\ntwo case studies (woody and ﬁeld crops) located\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain. We realize\nthat optimal irrigation programming\
    \ requires consistent investment in equipment, expenditure on\noperation and maintenance,\
    \ and qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services. These technological\napproaches\
    \ will be worthwhile in farms with low water availability, high proﬁtability,\
    \ and signiﬁcant\ntechnical-economic capacity.\nKeywords: water proﬁtability;\
    \ water scarcity; sensors; big data; information and communication\ntechnologies;\
    \ irrigation scheduling\n1. Introduction\nA growing international population and\
    \ rising living standards are increasing the demand for\nagricultural products.\
    \ At the same time, globalization, markets liberalization, growing pressure on\n\
    natural resources, and environmental concerns are heightening the need for improved\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nIn the case of irrigated agriculture, meeting\
    \ this requirement involves a paradigm shift. Maximizing\nnet proﬁts will demand\
    \ a more economic approach than simply maximizing crop yields. This is\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ complex and challenging, requiring that water be applied in a wiser, more precise,\
    \ and\naccurate fashion because the margin for error narrows [3].\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785; doi:10.3390/w12030785\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n2 of 26\nFrom an engineering standpoint, achieving the above depends on\
    \ having more information, using\nenhanced irrigation systems and making better\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. Instant information is\nrequired for a thorough\
    \ understanding of weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing\n\
    season. Enhanced irrigation systems are needed for a uniform application of water\
    \ depths tailored to\nthe spatiotemporal variability of the ﬁelds. Better decisions\
    \ are necessary to convert these capacities\ninto proﬁts.\nThe scientiﬁc community\
    \ and industry work to meet these needs, taking advantage of geolocated\nand internet-enabled\
    \ devices. As a result, a wide range of technologies has been developed. Multiple\n\
    sensors for weather, soil and plant measurements can supply data continuously\
    \ and automatically in\nﬁxed points located within the ﬁeld. Weather conditions,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature, plant sap ﬂow,\ntrunk diameter, and leaf turgor\
    \ pressure are some of the variables monitored by these sensors [4,5].\nData can\
    \ also be obtained for the whole ﬁeld area. Remote and proximal sensing based\
    \ on radar\nand spectral sensors onboard satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ tractors and even centre-pivots and\nlinear-moving irrigation systems allow\
    \ high spatial and/or temporal resolution monitoring of soil\nmoisture and plant\
    \ water and nutrient status. Proximal electromagnetic induction sensors can also\
    \ be\nused for mapping soil properties along with soil sampling and testing [6–8].\n\
    High quality equipment for water application has also been developed. If adequately\
    \ selected\nand dimensioned modern irrigation systems can provide excellent performance\
    \ under a wide range of\nenvironmental conditions. Furthermore, variable rate\
    \ technology enables the application of site-speciﬁc\nwater depths according to\
    \ the spatial variability of the soil and plant conditions throughout the ﬁeld\
    \ [8].\nDealing with all these data and irrigation system capabilities involves\
    \ great analytical complexity.\nAutomated irrigation controllers have been designed\
    \ for this purpose. These controllers include\na module that computes an optimized\
    \ irrigation scheduling (and a prescription map in the case\nof variable rate\
    \ systems) according to a predeﬁned irrigation strategy and goal. The optimization\n\
    process is based on sensor data or/and output data from simulation models. Given\
    \ the complexity of\nthe soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and the uncertainty of\
    \ the available data, artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques are used to search for\
    \ the optimal solution. These techniques are also applied in other\nrelated processes,\
    \ such as model calibration and weather and water demand forecasting [4,8,9].\n\
    Despite the sophistication of this cutting-edge hardware and software, their prices\
    \ have become\naﬀordable for commercial use. Recent advances in sensors and information\
    \ and communication\ntechnologies have slashed the cost of generating, transmitting,\
    \ storing and processing large amounts\nof data. Consequently, the implementation\
    \ of these technologies in commercial farms is considered\nfeasible, in practice,\
    \ for improving their economic and environmental footprint. Likewise, its use\n\
    could improve the adaptation to climate change and to changing water demand and\
    \ supply patterns,\nenhancing food security [10–13].\nAs a consequence, these\
    \ technologies for irrigation and agriculture are generally being considered\n\
    by governments and international organizations as promising tools to achieve a\
    \ sustainable\nintensiﬁcation of agricultural production [14–16]. However, some\
    \ studies carried out in industrialized\ncountries conclude that their adoption\
    \ is not widespread, and, on average, their economic proﬁtability\nis low [17,18].\n\
    Farmers readily adopt technologies, such as auto-steer machinery and irrigation\
    \ pivots, which\nrequire limited new training and skills. However, adoption of\
    \ information-intensive technologies,\nsuch as soil or plant moisture sensors\
    \ and related software, is often limited. These technologies\nrequire further\
    \ investments in learning and/or hiring external services for data analysis. Changes\
    \ in\nmanagement practices are also often needed to accommodate data-driven decisions.\
    \ Such requirements\nmay even aﬀect the proﬁle of farmers, shifting from that\
    \ of a land manager, who grows crops according\nto his/her practical experience,\
    \ to farm technician, whose work should also be based on technical\nknowledge\
    \ [18–20].\nFarmers can adopt very diﬀerent information technology levels to ﬁne-tune\
    \ their management\npractices. Each level encompasses the use of diﬀerent layers\
    \ of information. Assessing the value\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n3 of 26\ngiven by\
    \ each information layer is essential for selecting the most suitable technological\
    \ level for each\nfarm [5,19,21].\nThe value of information is the increase in\
    \ the expected value of the outcome arising from the\nintroduction of an additional\
    \ layer of information in the decision process [22]. It depends on the\nquality\
    \ of the data (e.g., precision, trueness and timing), its total cost (e.g., investment,\
    \ operation\nand maintenance) and the conditions of the farm (e.g., environmental,\
    \ agronomic, socio-economic,\nand technical). Therefore, a particular technology\
    \ can provide diﬀerent economic and environmental\nresults depending on the region\
    \ and farm where it is used [5,18,21].\nSelecting and managing the most suitable\
    \ technological level requires technical knowledge and\nskills, as well as unbiased\
    \ information about the performance of the available technologies. Poor\ninformation\
    \ and/or low knowledge and skills mean decisions are made in a context of uncertainty,\n\
    which in turn, means cultural factors and cognitive biases may lead to the adoption\
    \ of sub-optimal\nsolutions or simply to no decisions being made. Thus, the early\
    \ adopters of new technologies are usually\nyounger farmers, with higher education\
    \ levels and larger farms in terms of economic size [17–19,23,24].\nFarms located\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries of the EU are usually smallholdings managed\n\
    by aged farmers with a low level of technical education. These features hamper\
    \ the uptake of new\ntechnologies [24]. An example of this situation is Spain,\
    \ where 59% of the farmers are older than\n55 years and only 18% have agricultural\
    \ technical training for the implementation of information and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies (ICTs) on their farms. The mean economic farm size is 37,284 €\
    \ in terms\nof standard output, which is lower than two thirds of the EU15 average\
    \ (member states of the EU on\n30 April 2004), although the 1% largest farms (≥0.5\
    \ M€) accounts for 32% of the national standard\noutput [25].\nThe Government\
    \ is tackling this problem by promoting and subsidizing the modernization of\n\
    irrigation infrastructures. As a result, water transport and distribution facilities,\
    \ as well as on-farm\nirrigation systems have been modernized across 1.5 Mha since\
    \ the beginning of this century [26].\nHowever, a number of studies have suggested\
    \ that irrigation management should be enhanced in\norder to capture the full\
    \ economic and environmental value that modern infrastructure can potentially\n\
    provide [27–31].\nMuch research has been speciﬁcally conducted to bridge this\
    \ gap [32–36]. Nevertheless, there are\nvery few analyses focused on identifying\
    \ the farm conditions that make the techniques developed\nin these studies proﬁtable.\
    \ Such analyses, along with a strengthening of extension services, training\n\
    programs, and regional trials among other measures, would enhance farmers’ capabilities\
    \ to select and\nuse technologies that help them to optimize the management of\
    \ their irrigation infrastructures [18,21,24].\nIt is clear from the above overview\
    \ that carrying out an optimal irrigation scheduling is essential\nfor improving\
    \ water and energy use in irrigated agriculture. Accordingly, methodologies focused\
    \ on\nthis issue and advances in new technologies and equipment to be implemented\
    \ in this sector have been\ndeveloped. However, in the majority of farms, these\
    \ advances have not properly got oﬀ the ground due\nto the low technical training\
    \ of farmers and the reduced proﬁtability of agricultural products, making\nthe\
    \ investment of new technologies unaﬀordable. Hence, the aim of this study is\
    \ to review the main\nfactors inﬂuencing irrigation scheduling and document the\
    \ impact of ICTs on these factors to identify\nthe conditions that drive the return\
    \ on investment of various irrigation scheduling methodologies.\nThis review is\
    \ supported by the analysis of several case studies located in semi-arid areas\
    \ of Southeast\nSpain, a country with a 30% of irrigated cropland [37] and most\
    \ of this area being under Mediterranean\nnatural conditions. The review starts\
    \ by describing the main factors that should be considered for\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Then, several case studies methodologies focused on optimal irrigation\n\
    scheduling applied in both woody and ﬁeld crops under semi-arid conditions are\
    \ presented. In the\nﬁnal section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of\
    \ these irrigation scheduling methodologies,\nbased on the case studies evaluated.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n4 of 26\n2. Factors that Aﬀect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated,\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 1. Diﬀerent combinations of these factors enable optimal\
    \ irrigation schedules to be achieved\ndepending on the technological level of\
    \ the farms (low, intermediate, or high) as regards the technological\nelements\
    \ used, as described below.\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n4  of  25 \n \n2. Factors that Affect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling \n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated, as shown in \n\
    Fig.1.  Different  combinations  of  these  factors  enable  optimal  irrigation \
    \ schedules  to  be  achieved \ndepending  on  the  technological  level  of \
    \ the  farms  (low,  intermediate,  or  high)  as  regards  the \ntechnological elements used, as described below. \n\
     \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors. \n \nCrop \n\
    The crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to satisfy the fraction \n\
    of crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisfied with rainwater during the crop season. WR \n\
    are equivalent to the amount of water evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the \n\
    agro‐climatic variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coefficient, Kc [38]. It depends \n\
    on  the  crop  characteristics,  taking  into  account  crop  height,  the  crop‐soil \
    \ surface  resistance,  and \nalbedo of the crop soil surface [39].   \nRecommended Kc values for different crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there \n\
    are  no  available  Kc  values  for  certain  crops,  or  the  recommended  values \
    \ are  suited  to  different \nenvironmental  conditions  [40].  Thus,  different \
    \ works  have  focused  on  setting  specific  Kc  values \nconsidering on‐site environmental conditions by relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44]. \n\
    Alternatively, other authors have used crop simulation models to determine specific Kc values for \n\
    non‐stressed and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]). \
    \  \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors.\n• Crop\nThe\
    \ crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to\
    \ satisfy the fraction\nof crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisﬁed\
    \ with rainwater during the crop season. WR are\nequivalent to the amount of water\
    \ evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the\nagro-climatic\
    \ variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coeﬃcient, Kc [38].\
    \ It depends\non the crop characteristics, taking into account crop height, the\
    \ crop-soil surface resistance, and albedo\nof the crop soil surface [39].\nRecommended\
    \ Kc values for diﬀerent crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there\n\
    are no available Kc values for certain crops, or the recommended values are suited\
    \ to diﬀerent\nenvironmental conditions [40]. Thus, diﬀerent works have focused\
    \ on setting speciﬁc Kc values\nconsidering on-site environmental conditions by\
    \ relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44].\nAlternatively, other authors\
    \ have used crop simulation models to determine speciﬁc Kc values for\nnon-stressed\
    \ and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]).\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 785\n5 of 26\nThe use of speciﬁc crop coeﬃcients can improve irrigation\
    \ programming, generating both higher\nyields and water use eﬃciency [46].\n•\
    \ Weather data\nLocal weather determines crop irrigation requirements (IR) and\
    \ consequently irrigation programming.\nRainfall and air temperature are the basic\
    \ data required to calculate IR using values of eﬀective\nprecipitation (Pe) and\
    \ ETo estimated by low-parameter procedures like the Hargreaves equation [47].\n\
    However, many weather stations can now also record data such as humidity, solar\
    \ radiation and wind\nspeed, among others (e.g., [48]). When this information\
    \ is available, physically based ETo calculation\nmethods, such as the Penman-Monteith\
    \ model [38], can be used to provide accurate estimations of\nETo [49,50]. Thus,\
    \ in many cases, there is either a lack of data or their quality is not guaranteed,\n\
    or the weather station is located too far from the area studied [51,52]. This\
    \ leads to non-accurate ETo\nestimations [53] which means uncertainties in the\
    \ irrigation programming.\n• Soil data\nSoil characteristics such as soil condition,\
    \ slope, texture, structure, depth, organic matter content,\nbulk density, salinity,\
    \ acidity drainage, fertility and chemical parameters aﬀect soil water distribution\n\
    and root water absorption [54]. Standard numerical soil properties at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 250 m and at\na global scale can be obtained from systems such\
    \ as SoilGridsTM [55]. However, soil measurements are\npoint measurements that\
    \ show spatiotemporal variability in the same ﬁeld during the irrigation season.\n\
    Accordingly, these authors evaluated the time and spatial variability of soil\
    \ hydraulic characteristics\nduring the cropping season, showing that soil variations\
    \ during the season are important and lead to\ninaccurate irrigation programming.\
    \ Irrigation events also aﬀect soil hydraulic characteristics, which\nhighlights\
    \ the importance of carrying out soil hydraulic parameter analysis during the\
    \ cropping season\nto improve irrigation programming [56].\nIn sandy soils, with\
    \ a low water retention capacity, spatiotemporal hydraulic characterization is\n\
    crucial [57,58]. As an example of watering diﬃculties in sandy soils, in a two-season\
    \ study of irrigated\npotato cultivated in a sandy soil in USA, soil water storage\
    \ and deep drainage at several zones across\nthe farm were evaluated [57], detecting\
    \ a signiﬁcant spatiotemporal variability in soil water storage\nand temporal\
    \ diﬀerences on deep drainage. To reduce deep drainage, soil water movement models\n\
    like Hydrus 2-D were used to set the optimum duration of irrigation pulses in\
    \ strawberries cultivated\nin extremely sandy soils in Spain, for each crop development\
    \ stage [58].\n• Irrigation scheduling criteria\nIrrigation scheduling consists\
    \ of setting the timing and the amount of water to be applied to the\ncrop [59]\
    \ to either maximize the production or to maximize the beneﬁt [59]. Over recent\
    \ decades, these\ngoals have also been linked to eﬃciency criteria in the use\
    \ of both water and energy resources [60].\nTo achieve them, several “irrigation\
    \ criteria” have been used to establish the irrigation scheduling:\n(1) A farmer’s\
    \ perception/ experience of crop irrigation needs, which usually results in less-than-optimal\n\
    irrigation scheduling (lack of water during some crop stages and over-irrigation\
    \ in others) and hence,\nlower production and proﬁts [61]; (2) Rational estimation\
    \ of daily crop irrigation requirements using\nhistorical climate data that are\
    \ daily updated during the irrigation season [62]; (3) Rational estimation\nof\
    \ daily crop irrigation requirements based on both climate information and on\
    \ daily soil water\nbalance [63,64]; (4) Estimation of daily irrigation needs\
    \ using soil water data collected from soil\nmoisture sensors [65,66]; (5) Irrigation\
    \ needs estimated from plant water status monitoring using sap\nﬂow sensors [5,67],\
    \ trunk growth rate sensors [68], leaf water potential [69], or leaf turgor pressure\n\
    sensors [70], among others.\nThe above criteria deﬁne the daily irrigation program\
    \ once the irrigation strategy is established.\nSeveral factors condition the\
    \ irrigation strategy: the water allocation for the whole season (from full\n\
    irrigation to diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation [71]); the type of irrigation\
    \ system and its hydraulic\ncharacteristics [62,63]; or water availability at\
    \ ﬁeld scale, according to the management of the irrigation\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n\
    6 of 26\ndistrict (on demand irrigation in which farmers can irrigate 24 h a day\
    \ or by irrigation turns [72,73]),\nto name a few.\n• Water source, water rights,\
    \ and water markets\nWater sources for irrigation include groundwater from wells,\
    \ surface water, rain harvesting and\ntreated water from municipal areas [74].\
    \ The kind and quality of water source aﬀects water availability\nat ﬁeld scale.\
    \ For example, groundwater is a more reliable water source and less vulnerable\
    \ to drought\ncompared to surface water [75]. As for using rain harvesting pond\
    \ or treated water for irrigation, water\navailability will be aﬀected by climatic\
    \ variables, the pond storage capacity, and the legislation on that\nissue [76,77].\n\
    Water rights are required to legally establish the available water at ﬁeld scale.\
    \ “A water right\nis a legal entitlement authorizing water to be diverted from\
    \ a speciﬁed source and put to beneﬁcial,\nnon-wasteful use” [78]. Hence, water\
    \ rights aﬀect irrigation programming.\nTo name a few examples, in England, a\
    \ license is required to abstract water for irrigation and to\nobtain/ renew this\
    \ license, farmers must demonstrate that water is used eﬃciently [79]. In areas\
    \ of\nhigh competition for water, such as the Mediterranean basin, the water authorities\
    \ usually impose\nrestrictions on water use that do not always make the producer\
    \ aware of the eﬃcient use of irrigation\nwater, implementing precision irrigation\
    \ based on optimal irrigation schedules [80]. In Spain, water\nallocations are\
    \ usually assigned per crop, causing occasional disputes between water authorities\
    \ and\nfarmers, who demand more water [81].\nIn other areas, water rights are\
    \ characterized by elements such as priority date, whereby users\nwho ﬁrst acquired\
    \ water rights take preference in accessing water resources over other users who\n\
    obtained their rights later. Hence, during droughts periods, reductions in water\
    \ allocations aﬀect “new”\nfarmers ﬁrst [82]. Accordingly, in a study carried\
    \ out in California’s Central Valley on the eﬀects of\nwater rights on agricultural\
    \ production during drought periods, it was shown that watersheds whose\nfarmers\
    \ have more senior water rights have on average better agricultural productivity\
    \ outcomes than\nwatersheds with more junior rights [83].\nIn some semi-arid countries,\
    \ particularly during droughts, economic instruments to deal with\nwater allocations\
    \ are available. Water markets are one such instrument, enabling voluntary water\n\
    exchanges between users. Australia, and to a lesser extent, Spain and California,\
    \ are three representative\nexamples of water trade [84]. In a study on the eﬀects\
    \ of droughts on water markets in the three regions\nindicated above, the authors\
    \ highlighted that drought periods are a triggering factor for water trade\nbetween\
    \ users [84].\n• Water distribution system and irrigation system.\nOpen channel\
    \ water distribution networks usually entail higher water losses than pressurized\n\
    irrigation networks [85]. Therefore, these losses must be taken into account for\
    \ irrigation programming [86].\nConversely, pressurized irrigation networks show\
    \ higher water use eﬃciency but also increased energy\nrequirements [87]. In these\
    \ kinds of networks, the operating conditions should be considered in the\ndesign\
    \ of such networks. This ensures that hydrant service conditions are adequate\
    \ for the proper\nfunctioning of on-ﬁeld irrigation systems, applying the expected\
    \ water depth and avoiding inadequate\nirrigation schedules that lead to ineﬃcient\
    \ use of water [88].\nThe hydraulic features of the on-farm irrigation system\
    \ must also be considered to establish the\nirrigation programming. These features\
    \ depend on the type of system (surface, sprinkler, or trickle)\nand its design\
    \ (layout) and hydrant operation (sectoring) [63,89].\n• Energy source and its\
    \ management\nPressurized water distribution and application systems are generally\
    \ more eﬃcient in the use of\nwater than open channel systems. For this reason,\
    \ they have become common in recent decades [90].\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n7 of 26\n\
    However, the price to be paid for this improvement is the augmentation of energy\
    \ costs, in many\ncases leading to increases of more than 50% in the cost of irrigation\
    \ compared to previous gravity\nirrigation systems [85].\nIn recent years, numerous\
    \ studies have aimed to optimize the use of water and energy in irrigation\nsystems\
    \ at irrigation district scale considering the operation of the network (sectoring,\
    \ control of critical\npoints or electric tariﬀ selection, [91–93]). The operation\
    \ of the main hydraulic networks designed\nto reduce energy costs may limit the\
    \ available irrigation time for farmers conditioning the irrigation\nschedule\
    \ of their ﬁelds. For example, some irrigation districts (ID) in Spain have reduced\
    \ their energy\ncosts by choosing the lowest electric tariﬀ: farmers can irrigate\
    \ during the night from Monday to Friday\nand for 24 h on Saturdays, Sundays,\
    \ and bank holidays [73]. Their energy costs savings are about 25%\nfor similar\
    \ water use [94].\nHowever, optimal management of irrigation networks does not\
    \ avoid the dependence of irrigation\nagriculture on ﬂuctuations in energy prices.\
    \ Therefore, in recent years, the reduction of electricity\nproduction costs from\
    \ renewable energy sources (wind, solar photovoltaic and micro hydropower)\nis\
    \ facilitating their incorporation into the irrigation sector [64,95,96]. Since\
    \ the generation of energy\ndepends on suitable weather conditions (suﬃcient wind\
    \ or solar radiation for pumping), irrigation\nmust be scheduled around the availability\
    \ of renewably sourced energy [64].\n• Management and control technologies\nThe\
    \ technological development of the last decade has had enormous repercussions\
    \ in irrigation\nmanagement and control. Today’s commercial sensors and irrigation\
    \ controllers, ICs, provide a good\nvalue for money in an aﬀordable price range\
    \ for most farmers. In addition, the constant improvement\nof information and\
    \ communication technologies, ICTs, facilitates the interaction between sensors,\
    \ IC,\nand users through web platforms and applications for mobile devices [62,97].\n\
    ICs open and close pipes remotely enabling or disabling the electro-valves associated\
    \ with each\nirrigation sector according to the irrigation times programmed (input\
    \ data). These are key devices to\nmake irrigation easier for farmers as they\
    \ can start and ﬁnish irrigation at any time, no matter day or\nnight, during\
    \ the daily period available for irrigation with daily, weekly or monthly frequency.\
    \ Input\ndata are introduced by the user, or a baseline irrigation schedule is\
    \ updated periodically according to\nreal time information on the variables that\
    \ aﬀect irrigation (e.g., soil moisture, pressure at the pumping\nstation, irradiance)\
    \ measured by sensors [64]. The IC’s operational rules may be simple (exceedance\
    \ of\nthreshold values) or optimal irrigation schedules based on soil-plant-water\
    \ models and optimization\nprocedures [34,98–101]. Thus, the IC installed on a\
    \ farm conditions the irrigation programming.\nThere currently exists a wide range\
    \ of commercial sensors to monitor and control crop, soil,\nclimatic variables\
    \ and the irrigation network. Their records are stored in data loggers that, in\
    \ most\ncases, can be remotely accessed by ICs and/or web platforms/app for mobile\
    \ terminals.\nWeb platforms funded by either public institutions or private associations\
    \ to support irrigation\nprogramming have become a common tool among technical\
    \ staﬀ and farmers, many of them accessible\nby apps for smartphones/tablets,\
    \ thanks to the exponential development of ICTs in recent years [102].\nIrrigation\
    \ apps allow farmers to visualize the key variables of each event, and even act\
    \ on the system\nfrom almost anywhere, as telecommunication coverage has improved\
    \ in rural areas. Web platforms\nand apps are accessible for both individual farmers\
    \ and irrigators’ associations, expanding the number\nof potential users compared\
    \ to the supervisory control and acquisition data systems, SCADA, which\nmonitored\
    \ and controlled systems from a ﬁxed location and were restricted to associations\
    \ and large\nfarms, but which have been a key factor in the digitization of irrigated\
    \ agriculture [103].\nThe spatiotemporal variability of applied water depth should\
    \ be considered to improve irrigation\nscheduling. Remote sensing techniques based\
    \ on the use of satellite images and unmanned aerial\nvehicles, or geostatistical\
    \ methods that require either detailed soil study and dense sampling or\nestimation\
    \ of soil moisture content from alternative low-cost techniques (e.g., electromagnetic\
    \ induction\nexploration techniques) are complementary tools for monitoring the\
    \ real application of irrigation water.\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n8 of 26\nThis permits\
    \ the visualization of the spatial variability of soil water content, splitting\
    \ the cropped area\ninto irrigation sectors with ad hoc irrigation programs [30,104,105].\n\
    • Data analysis and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nThe modernization of many irrigation\
    \ networks involved not only the change of hydraulic\ninfrastructures, but also\
    \ the installation of telemetry devices, initially aimed at automating billing,\n\
    recording consumption at user level at certain intervals (big data collection)\
    \ [103].\nThe robustness of the current telemetry systems, most of which are based\
    \ on wireless communication,\nfacilitates database feeding with large amounts\
    \ of data. It is increasingly common today for farmers’\nassociations to record\
    \ detailed information on their users’ water consumption (hourly consumption)\n\
    throughout the irrigation campaign. These massive data sets (weather, crop, soil,\
    \ irrigation network\noperation and even markets data) require storage space (e.g.,\
    \ cloud storage) to be further processed by\nAI techniques. There are a wide variety\
    \ of AI techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, fuzzy logic,\nor decision\
    \ trees, that can be applied separately or combined to improve the accuracy of\
    \ irrigation\nprogramming [98,102].\nConsumption data linked to water use features\
    \ at hydrant level (soil, critical periods of crop\ndevelopment, water allocation,\
    \ etc.), agroclimatic information provided by public and/or private\nweb platforms\
    \ and, when available, the knowledge of farmer’s behaviour (related, for example,\n\
    to their perception of weather conditions, national holidays and vacation periods)\
    \ allow accurate\npredictions of irrigation scheduling at farmer scale (when,\
    \ how much and for how long he/she\nirrigates) [106–108]. Accurate individual\
    \ irrigation schedules aggregated at irrigation district level\nprovide valuable\
    \ information for managers to optimize the use of water and energy.\n• Economy\
    \ and farmer’s behaviour\nThe costs of current irrigation scheduling systems (e.g.,\
    \ ICs, sensors, apps, web platforms,\netc.) are generally falling. However, for\
    \ moderate- to low-proﬁt crops, this technology may still be\ncost-prohibitive\
    \ if it doesn’t signiﬁcantly increase farmer income [61]. However, the production\
    \ of\nhigh value crops in areas with low water availability, such as greenhouse\
    \ crops in Southeast Spain, is\nhighly technological, particularly in irrigation\
    \ scheduling [109].\nMarket demands have a great inﬂuence on farmers, as the economic\
    \ factor is the main driver for\nimproving their irrigation management (including\
    \ technology). Markets, especially for fresh products,\ndemand products be obtained\
    \ sustainably. Water plays a crucial role in the concept of sustainability\napplied\
    \ to irrigated agricultural production. For growers, it is increasingly important\
    \ that their\nproducts are identiﬁed as sustainable through the corresponding\
    \ indicators and certiﬁcations, in order\nto maintain or even increase their market\
    \ price. For example, the use of the Water Footprint indicator\n(volume of water\
    \ used throughout the growing season divided by the production obtained) [110],\
    \ which\ncan be estimated by applying diﬀerent methodologies (waterfootprint.org,\
    \ ISO14046 standard [80,111]),\nencourages the use of optimal irrigation scheduling\
    \ systems to make eﬃcient use of water while\nmaintaining production levels.\n\
    3. Actual Cases of Application of Optimal Irrigation Programming\n3.1. Automatic\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling in Woody Crops\nThis study case focuses on the results\
    \ obtained in the implementation of an automated irrigation\nprotocol based on\
    \ water uptake estimated from soil water content data, measured by multi-capacitance\n\
    probes, on two early-maturing Prunus persica L. orchards growing in semi-arid\
    \ conditions in Southeast\nSpain. This area is subject to Mediterranean climate\
    \ where water resources are dwindling, and\nagriculture sector accounts for 80%\
    \ of all water withdrawals.\nUnder this scenario, most water\nuser associations\
    \ must deal with permanent water deﬁcits through the irrigation season. The water\n\
    application for high crop yield and quality must be carried out in such a way\
    \ as to be eﬃcient in relieving\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n9 of 26\nstress in the most\
    \ sensitive phenological phases by applying deﬁcit irrigation (DI) strategies\
    \ [112].\nDI requires the use of sensors for real time monitoring of the soil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ system [113].\nA controlled deﬁcit irrigated peach tree experiment and a full-irrigated\
    \ nectarine tree experiments\nare described in the following subsections. Both\
    \ studies aim to compare irrigation scheduling based on\nsoil water sensors with\
    \ an ETc-based treatment.\n3.1.1. Experimental Site and Plant Material\nThe experiments\
    \ were carried out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station in Santomera,\n\
    Murcia, Spain (38◦06′31” N, 1◦02′14” W, 110 m altitude) in two adjacent early-maturing\
    \ Prunus persica\n(L.) Batsch tree orchards: peach trees (cv. Flordastar) were\
    \ spaced 5 × 5 m, and nectarine trees\n(cv. Flariba) 6.5 m × 3.5 m, both trained\
    \ to an open-centre canopy. The soil in the 0–0.5 m layer was\nstony, highly calcareous\
    \ (45% calcium carbonate), with a clay loam texture (clay fraction: 41% Illite,\n\
    17% Smectite, and 30% Paligorskita). The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3.\
    \ The soil water content\nat ﬁeld capacity and wilting permanent point were 0.29\
    \ and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively.\nThe average electrical conductivity (EC25ºC)\
    \ of the irrigation water was close to 1.3 dS m−1.\nThe irrigation system (97%\
    \ uniformity coeﬃcient) consisted of a single drip line per tree row with\npressure-compensated\
    \ emitters (8 × 2 Lh−1 and 4 × 4 Lh−1 per tree for peach and nectarine trees,\n\
    respectively) evenly distributed along the lateral.\nHarvesting took place in\
    \ the ﬁrst week of May. Other standard cultural practices such as winter\npruning\
    \ (during dormancy), thinning (March) and pest control were performed by experiment\
    \ station\npersonnel. More details on plant phenology can be found in [114].\n\
    Two treatments were considered: a control (conventional 100% ETc as ET0 × Kc computations,\
    \ [37],\nKc from [115] and an automated irrigation scheduling based on soil water\
    \ content values. These were\ndistributed in a completely randomized design with\
    \ four repetitions per irrigation treatment, each\nconsisting of one row of 13\
    \ trees (peach) and six trees (nectarine).\n3.1.2. Measurements\nAgrometeorological\
    \ data, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global\nradiation,\
    \ precipitation, and ET0 (FAO56-Penman Monteith, [37]) were recorded by an automated\n\
    weather station located at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station and integrated\
    \ in a web server\n(http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.html). The\
    \ climate conditions registered were those\ntypical of Mediterranean areas, characterized\
    \ by high seasonality summarized as hot and dry summers\nand cool and wet winters\
    \ with high evaporative demand (ET0 ten-year average values of 1320 mm)\nand low\
    \ rainfall, normally below 250 mm.\nThe volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was\
    \ monitored with multi-depth capacitance FDR\n(Frequency Domain Reﬂectometry)\
    \ probes (EnviroSCAN) assembled with a PCB interface SDI-12.\nFour PVC access\
    \ tubes were installed 0.1 m to the emitter located close to the tree trunk in\
    \ four\nrepresentative trees, one of each replication. Each capacitance probe\
    \ had sensors ﬁtted to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5\nand 0.7 (nectarine), 0.8 (peach) m depth,\
    \ and were connected to a radio transmission unit, which read\nevery 5 min and\
    \ recorded the average value every 15 min. The sensors were previously normalized\
    \ on\nair and irrigation water and, subsequently, converted to VSWC using Sentek’s\
    \ default calibration for a\nclay-loam soil. Average VSWC values in the 0–0.5\
    \ m soil proﬁle were calculated, since they correspond\nto the maximum root density\
    \ area [116]. Volumetric counters were installed for each treatment and\ndrip\
    \ gauges were placed below the emitter, in the same place location as the capacitance\
    \ probe, to\nmonitor real time irrigation amount.\nProbes were connected to a\
    \ radio transmission unit network sending data to a gateway connected\nvia TCP/IP\
    \ to an AddVantage web server. In this server, a feedback condition was in charge\
    \ of triggering\nand closing electrovalves depending on mean ﬁeld values. Irrigation\
    \ alarms were also deﬁned to\nprevent water losses, and electrovalve failures.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n10 of 26\nTree water status was evaluated weekly from March\
    \ to October in one mature leaf per tree and\nreplications (n = 4), by measuring\
    \ midday stem water potential (Ψstem, MPa) using a pressure chamber\n(Soil Moisture\
    \ Equip. Corp. Model 3000). Net CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance\
    \ were\nmeasured along the season with a portable gas exchange system (LI-COR,\
    \ LI-6400) for validating\nirrigation practices.\n3.1.3. Automated Irrigation\
    \ Criteria\nThe automated irrigation treatment was based on VSWC values in the\
    \ 0–0.5 m depth, thus soil\nsensors become practical biosensors of the root water\
    \ uptake. One deeper sensor would monitor the\nwetting front beyond the roots.\
    \ Integration of average VSWC values and the threshold values acted on\nelectro-valves\
    \ by the telemetry system.\nAs described by [117,118] in the peach orchard, the\
    \ ﬁrst approach consisted of monitoring the\nVSWC pattern in the peach orchard\
    \ throughout the season using conventional ETc values for irrigation.\nThis resulted\
    \ in over- and under-irrigation, indicating that better scheduling was needed.\
    \ In the second\napproach, irrigation was automatically managed by checking the\
    \ VSWC at 22:00 h, and irrigation only\nstarted if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer\
    \ at this time was below 95% of ﬁeld capacity (FC) and stopped\nwhen the sensor\
    \ at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded at 22:00 h.\
    \ This\nprocedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive decrease\
    \ in VSWC at 0.8 m,\nwith increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the\
    \ target.\nIn the third approach, real-time irrigation was managed according to\
    \ diﬀerent VSWC threshold\nvalues, as proposed by [119,120], based on the diﬀerent\
    \ sensitivities to water stress depending on the\nphenological stage of the tree\
    \ [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at\n95%\
    \ FC and ended at FC, and during post-harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and\
    \ ended at 95% FC.\nSubsequently, the post-harvest period was divided into two:\
    \ early (mid-May to mid-July, with 90 and\n95% FC, for start and end of irrigation,\
    \ respectively) and late (from mid-July onwards, with 85 and 90%\nFC, respectively).\n\
    The fourth approach consisted of converting previous trigger/stopping criteria\
    \ into the universal\nmanagement allowed depletion (MAD) fraction, derived from\
    \ the original water availability\nconcept [122].\nFor stone fruit tress under\
    \ drip irrigation, the values α = 0.1 MAD during the\ncritical period (fruit growth\
    \ and early postharvest) and α = 0.3 MAD during late-postharvest were\napplied\
    \ (Figure 2). This approach was studied in a nectarine orchard (with a similar\
    \ phenology\ncalendar as in peach) with the aim of fulﬁlling plant water requirements\
    \ [123].\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n10  of  25 \nirrigation only started if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer at this time was below 95% of field capacity \n\
    (FC) and stopped when the sensor at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded \n\
    at 22:00 h. This procedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive decrease in \n\
    VSWC at 0.8 m, with increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the target. \
    \  \nIn the third approach, real‐time irrigation was managed according to different VSWC threshold \n\
    values, as proposed by [119,120], based on the different sensitivities to water stress depending on the \n\
    phenological stage of the tree [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at \n\
    95% FC and ended at FC, and during post‐harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and ended at 95% \n\
    FC. Subsequently, the post‐harvest period was divided into two: early (mid‐May to mid‐July, with 90 \n\
    and 95% FC, for start and end of irrigation, respectively) and late (from mid‐July onwards, with 85 \n\
    and 90% FC, respectively). \nThe  fourth  approach  consisted  of  converting \
    \    previous  trigger/stopping  criteria  into  \nthe  universal   management \
    \  allowed   depletion   (MAD)   fraction,   derived   from   the   original \
    \ \nwater availability concept [122]. For stone fruit tress under drip irrigation, the values α=0.1 MAD \n\
    during  the  critical  period  (fruit  growth  and  early  postharvest)  and \
    \ α=0.3  MAD  during  late‐\npostharvest were \nFigure 2. Average volumetric soil water content (VSWC, θv) values in the 0‐0.5 m soil profile (black \n\

    \ It should be noted that irrigation\nevents could occur at any time of the day\
    \ according to the rules deﬁned above, and when precipitation\nevents matched\
    \ with irrigation, irrigation was automatically stopped as soon as VSWC reached\
    \ the\nimposed values. It must be pointed out that only heavy precipitation events,\
    \ such as those recorded\nduring spring (46.6 mm in March and 87 mm early September)\
    \ (Figure 2), induced signiﬁcant increases\nin VSWC values at 0.7 m depth, possibly\
    \ causing some water losses through the plant root inﬂuence.\nHowever, VSWC at\
    \ a deeper soil proﬁle remained constant most of the time. Therefore, drainage\
    \ can\nbe assumed to be negligible under these conditions.\nVSWC-based treatment\
    \ induced moderate water deﬁcits in peach trees as indicated the lower Ψstem\n\
    values (up to −1.5 MPa) compared with the control trees (around −0.8 MPa) during\
    \ the postharvest\nperiod [117,120]. Ψstem values for nectarine trees remained\
    \ around −1 MPa in both treatments [123].\nAs many authors have proposed for deciduous\
    \ fruit trees [117,121,124–126], the post-harvest\nperiod is suitable for applying\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation strategies because this stage is less sensitive\
    \ to\nsoil water deﬁcits than during fruiting. Interestingly, in the two studied\
    \ early-maturing Prunus cultivars,\npost-harvest is the longest period of the\
    \ growing season, accounting for 80% of the water requirements\nneeded for the\
    \ entire irrigation season [120], and is important because it is when carbohydrate\
    \ reserves\nare accumulated and the ﬂoral diﬀerentiation process occurs [127].\
    \ Accordingly, water deﬁcits should\nbe managed carefully in order to avoid severe\
    \ plant water deﬁcits that would reduce bloom and fruit\nload in the next season’s\
    \ harvest [117,120,121,125,126,128].\nOther studies have indicated that monitoring\
    \ the VSWC with capacitive FDR probes improved overall\nirrigation, providing\
    \ good calibration, installation, and data acquisition and interpretation [113,114,120,129].\n\
    Ref. [130] suggested pulsed irrigations based on MAD (maintained between 50 and\
    \ 15%) for\nautomated irrigation of watermelons; when the given set point was\
    \ detected, a 30 min irrigation cycle\nwas initiated followed by a 1h wait period.\
    \ Furthermore, [131] compared several irrigation scheduling\nalgorithms including,\
    \ among others, soil-based ones using granular matrix sensors and soil water\n\
    balance. They concluded that the latter seemed to be economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate for\nautomatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees.\n\
    Our ﬁndings indicated that irrigation scheduling based on precise VSWC threshold\
    \ values is a\nuseful tool for monitoring the soil water status, allowing automatic\
    \ and eﬃcient irrigation management.\nWhen probes are located at the maximum root\
    \ exploration volume and the thresholds were precisely\ndeﬁned, an adequate plant\
    \ water status was favoured, resulting in slight water deﬁcits limiting only\n\
    vegetative growth while maintaining high yields with prime quality. A peach yield\
    \ of 18.2 t ha−1\nwas obtained in the soil-based treatment, which was non-signiﬁcantly\
    \ diﬀerent in comparison with\n20.1 t ha−1 in the traditional scheduled trees,\
    \ allowing a 33% of water saving against an irrigation\napplication of 7000–7300\
    \ m3 ha−1) [117,120].\nIn addition, the real-time SWC values led to the automation\
    \ of irrigation without inducing water\nstress in nectarine trees, deriving irrigation\
    \ factors that in a practical, easy and precise manner, allowed\nprecision irrigationto\
    \ be managed [123]. Annual water requirements for early-maturing nectarine trees,\n\
    in the agro-climatic area of Region de Murcia (Southeast Spain), ﬁgured ≈ 6600\
    \ m3 ha−1, with irrigation\nfrequency varying from <1 to 7 days a week depending\
    \ on the phenological period. However, in this\nexperiment only 4500 m3 ha−1 were\
    \ applied, with around 30% of water savings as compared to control\ntrees irrigated\
    \ following traditional FAO-56 approach.\n3.2. Irrigation Scheduling in Arable\
    \ Crops\nAgriculture in Castilla-La Mancha (CLM) occupies an area of 3,773,029\
    \ ha, of which 557,851 ha\nare irrigated lands [132], mainly with sprinkler and\
    \ drip irrigation systems. The use of irrigation in\nthe area is the result of\
    \ low average annual precipitation (around 400 mm year−1) and high reference\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n12 of 26\nevapotranspiration (>1100 mm year−1), characterizing\
    \ the area as semi-arid [133]. The most common\nirrigated crops are grapes, cereals,\
    \ garlic, onion, melon, watermelon, pepper, and others such as\nsunﬂower, potato,\
    \ and alfalfa.\nApproximately 70% of the irrigable area in CLM is located close\
    \ to groundwater sources (average\nelectrical conductivity EC = 0.8 dS m−1, which\
    \ is suitable for irrigation), given that most surface\nwater resources are used\
    \ in other bordering regions. In order to avoid the overexploitation of these\n\
    aquifers, farmers are restricted in the use of water by the water authority in\
    \ the area (“Confederación\nHidrográﬁca del Júcar” in the case of the Eastern\
    \ Mancha aquifer, and “Confederación Hidrográﬁca del\nGuadiana” in the case of\
    \ the Western Mancha and Campo de Montiel aquifers). Every year, the water\nauthority\
    \ determines the amount of water that each farmer can use, depending on the progression\
    \ of\nthe piezometric levels of the aquifers. Consequently, the total area irrigated\
    \ in the region varies each\nyear, as does the crop pattern, which is conditioned\
    \ by the evolution of the harvest prices. Moreover,\nthe increasing cost of energy\
    \ required for pumping groundwater and irrigating crops using pressurized\nirrigation\
    \ systems is another factor conditioning the use of water and the proﬁtability\
    \ of the irrigated\nfarms. Groundwater in the area is free, but farmers must pay\
    \ for the energy and the amortization of\nthe irrigation systems. Thus, the average\
    \ water cost in the area is around 0.12 € m−3 [134].\nLarge areas of rainfed land\
    \ were transformed into irrigated land during the 1970s and 1980s,\nwhereby the\
    \ average size of the holdings (rainfed and irrigated) is about 33 ha, which is\
    \ an appropriate\nsize for farm proﬁtability. However, only 8% of farmers are\
    \ younger than 40 years, and many of them\ncombine agriculture with other activities,\
    \ fostering the adoption of innovative methodologies and the\nmodernization of\
    \ their exploitations [135].\nAs a way to maximize the production proﬁtability\
    \ of irrigated crops in water scare regions such\nas CLM, the Regional Centre\
    \ of Water Research (CREA) of Castilla-La Mancha University (UCLM)\nhas developed\
    \ MOPECO (economic optimization model of irrigation water) [136–138]. The model\
    \ is\nbased on FAO-33 [139] and FAO-56 [38] methodologies, and has been calibrated\
    \ for diﬀerent annual\nextensive crops in several areas of the world [137,140–145].\
    \ MOPECO is designed to provide farmers\nwith a reliable and friendly on-line\
    \ tool for the proper management of farms and crops based on water\nproductivity\
    \ (WP).\n3.2.1. Optimal Distribution of Crops and Optimized Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    MOPECO’s main goal is to maximize the gross margin (GM) of irrigable lands dedicated\
    \ to the\ncultivation of annual crops through the eﬃcient use of irrigation water\
    \ and available irrigable area.\nA set of data (Figure 3) is required for the\
    \ simulation of the optimal “Yield vs. Total Net Water” (Y vs.\nTWN), function\
    \ of each crop under the climatic conditions of a certain year being TWN = net\
    \ irrigation\n(IN) + eﬀective rainfall (Pe). To obtain Y vs. TWN, the model simulates\
    \ a range of deﬁcit irrigation\nschedules using the optimized regulated deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation (ORDI) methodology [137], considering the\neﬀects of irrigation uniformity\
    \ [146] and electrical conductivity of water on yield [141].\nThe ORDI methodology\
    \ maximizes crop yield for a certain actual evapotranspiration value\n(ETa) versus\
    \ maximum evapotranspiration rate (ETm) objective for the whole crop growing period.\n\
    The methodology determines the value of the ETa/ETm ratio for the main Ky (crop\
    \ yield response factor\nby growing stage; [139]) stages deﬁned for each crop\
    \ (i.e., establishment and vegetative development,\nﬂowering, grain development\
    \ and ripening in the case of cereals). This combination of ETa/ETm\nrates maximizes\
    \ the crop yield according to the simulations carried out, using the equation\
    \ proposed\nby [147]. Consequently, this methodology allows the Y vs. TWN function\
    \ to be generated by simulating\nseveral irrigation schedules (the model determines\
    \ 100 points of the function, but the user may vary\nthis number).\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n13 of 26\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n13  of  25 \n \nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These tangent lines define the “Pareto front” [149], \n\
    which represents the maximum GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this \n\
    line, it is impossible to benefit one variable affecting the GM without damaging another. \n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers the most likely \n\
    crop distribution to maximize the profitability of their farms (Fig. 3).   \n\
     \n \nFigure 3. MOPECO flowchart. \nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume of water to crops lower \n\
    than their full irrigation requirements for the climatic conditions of the typical meteorological year \n\
    (TMY) [144,148]. This is because maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths \n\
    lower than that required for the maximum yield (Fig. 3) due to the effect of irrigation uniformity, \n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deficit irrigation [150]. \n\
    Moreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are unknown, and it is consequently impossible \n\
    to determine the optimal irrigation schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season. \n\
    To solve this question, [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which \n\
    modifies  the  ETa/ETm  objective  of  the  different  Ky  stages  in  several \
    \ consecutive  optimizations, \naccording to the progression of the real climatic conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at \n\
    the end of each stage, and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield, \n\
    the methodology determines the deficit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the crop at each Ky \n\
    stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit by using the \n\
    TMY climatic data and the MOPECO simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the first Ky \n\
    stage, the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined \n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end of the first stage, \n\
    the ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should be similar to the target (in the first \n\
    stage there is sufficient irrigation water) or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water \n\
    availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation \n\
    water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model. Consequently, after \n\
    the first Ky stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm targets for the following Ky stages, \n\

    \ MOPECO ﬂowchart.\nIn order to decrease the number of simulations for determining\
    \ the crop irrigation requirements\nunder local climatic conditions, the typical\
    \ meteorological year (TMY) [148] was adapted by [144] for\nirrigation scheduling.\
    \ A TMY consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated\n\
    to form a complete year with daily unmodiﬁed values (maximum and minimum temperature,\
    \ ETo and\nrainfall) which show a perfect interrelationship. In order to consider\
    \ several scenarios of irrigation\nwater requirements, dry, intermediate, and\
    \ wet TMYs were considered [145].\nThe Y vs. TWN function is translated into “Yield\
    \ vs. Total Gross Water” (Y vs. TWG), where TWG\n= gross irrigation (IG) + Pe,\
    \ to include the application eﬃciency of the irrigation system. The Gross\nMargin\
    \ (GM) vs. TWG function is then calculated using crop economic data. Finally,\
    \ the model\ncalculates the optimal crop distribution and the amount of water\
    \ assigned to each crop that fulﬁls\nthe restrictions imposed by the user (selected\
    \ crops, total irrigable area, and total available volume\nof irrigation water)\
    \ for certain climatic conditions through the direct solution algorithm developed\n\
    by [136]. This algorithm calculates the reference points where the tangent lines\
    \ that connect each pair of\nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These\
    \ tangent lines deﬁne the “Pareto front” [149],\nwhich represents the maximum\
    \ GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this\nline, it\
    \ is impossible to beneﬁt one variable aﬀecting the GM without damaging another.\n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers\
    \ the most likely\ncrop distribution to maximize the proﬁtability of their farms\
    \ (Figure 3).\nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume\
    \ of water to crops lower\nthan their full irrigation requirements for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the typical meteorological year\n(TMY) [144,148]. This is because\
    \ maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths\nlower than that\
    \ required for the maximum yield (Figure 3) due to the eﬀect of irrigation uniformity,\n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation [150].\nMoreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are\
    \ unknown, and it is consequently impossible\nto determine the optimal irrigation\
    \ schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season.\nTo solve this question,\
    \ [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which\nmodiﬁes\
    \ the ETa/ETm objective of the diﬀerent Ky stages in several consecutive optimizations,\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n14 of 26\naccording to the progression of the real climatic\
    \ conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at\nthe end of each stage,\
    \ and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield,\n\
    the methodology determines the deﬁcit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the\
    \ crop at each Ky\nstage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required\
    \ to reach that level of deﬁcit by using the\nTMY climatic data and the MOPECO\
    \ simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the ﬁrst Ky\nstage, the objective\
    \ is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined\n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end\
    \ of the ﬁrst stage,\nthe ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should\
    \ be similar to the target (in the ﬁrst\nstage there is suﬃcient irrigation water)\
    \ or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water\navailability do\
    \ not allow that level of deﬁcit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation\
    \ water\napplied to the crop will likely be diﬀerent to that forecast by the model.\
    \ Consequently, after the ﬁrst\nKy stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm\
    \ targets for the following Ky stages, taking into\naccount the actual remaining\
    \ irrigation water (2nd optimization). The same methodology is followed\nat the\
    \ end of each Ky stage. During the optimizations, a certain amount of irrigation\
    \ water is saved\nfor the last stage (that determined in the 2nd optimization)\
    \ in order to avoid the total depletion of\nirrigation water during previous Ky\
    \ stage. This methodology has been successfully applied under real\nmanagement\
    \ conditions in barley and garlic, as explained below.\n3.2.2. Applications\n\
    In order to validate MOPECO and assess its applicability, the following experiments\
    \ were\nconducted in commercial farms under diﬀerent water availability scenarios\
    \ [134,151–154].\nThe time and volume of water supplied to each experiment were\
    \ determined by MOPECO and\nchecked by soil moisture sensors or gravimetric samples.\n\
    Maize\nThe eﬀect of irrigation uniformity on maize (Zea Mays L.) yield and proﬁtability\
    \ was evaluated\nin 2016 in Albacete (Spain), in two adjacent sectors equipped\
    \ with a solid set sprinkler irrigation\nsystem [153]. The ﬁeld was managed according\
    \ to FAO-56 methodology throughout the growing\nseason to maximize grain yield\
    \ without water stress (Sector S1, considering 50% adequacy) or irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ determined by an experienced producer (Sector S2). Irrigation uniformity was\
    \ evaluated\nusing catch cans in both ﬁelds and grain yield was harvested within\
    \ zones exhibiting 75% (Z1), 100%\n(Z2), and 125% (Z3) of area-averaged volume\
    \ applications throughout the year. The average coeﬃcient\nof uniformity (CU)\
    \ in both sectors (S1 and S2) was 83.5%, and the net volume of applied irrigation\n\
    water totalled 709 mm in S1 and 832 mm in S2. Irrigation Water productivity (WP)\
    \ was higher in S1\n(2.20 kg m−3) than in S2 (2.05 kg m−3), highlighting the beneﬁts\
    \ of an accurate irrigation schedule on the\neﬃcient use of water. Nevertheless,\
    \ average grain yield in sector S2 approached the maximum expected\nyield of 18.4\
    \ Mg ha−1 and exhibited no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield among zones. In contrast,\n\
    sector S1 exhibited signiﬁcant yield diﬀerences (p < 0.05) across zones with a\
    \ measured yield in Z3\nof 18.5 Mg ha−1 and a yield reduction of 1.6 Mg ha−1 and\
    \ 4.0 Mg ha−1 in Z2 and Z1, respectively.\nConsequently, the area-averaged yield\
    \ in S1 was 8% lower than in S2. This last treatment was positively\ninﬂuenced\
    \ by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop (17%), which decreased\
    \ the\neﬀect of low CU (83.5%). Because of these yield diﬀerences and the relatively\
    \ low cost of irrigation\nwater (0.07 € m−3), area averaged gross margin in S1\
    \ was 18% lower compared with S2, discouraging\nan eﬃcient use of water by the\
    \ farmer. On the other hand, the grain yields simulated by MOPECO for\neach monitoring\
    \ zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends. Simulations\
    \ with\nMOPECO over a range of CU showed that improved irrigation uniformity increased\
    \ area-averaged\nyields and gross margin when following the S1 instead of S2 strategy.\
    \ In other words, eﬃcient use of\nirrigation water through accurate irrigation\
    \ scheduling and/or the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation\ntechniques requires\
    \ advanced management and maintenance of the irrigation systems.\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n15 of 26\nPurple garlic\nA two years (2015-2016) “Morado de Las Pedroñeras”\
    \ purple garlic ﬁeld experiment was conducted\nin Albacete (Spain) [151]. The\
    \ evaluated volumes of irrigation water were: no deﬁcit “ND”; and four\nvolumes\
    \ of available irrigation water: 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”, and 70% “T70”\
    \ of the net\nirrigation requirements (In = 3400 m3 ha−1 = T100) for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the intermediate TMY).\nORDI treatments reached high yields (between\
    \ 10,055 kg ha−1 of treatment ND and 8260 kg ha−1 of\nT70), also improving the\
    \ productivity of the irrigation water (up to 7.7 kg m−3 with T70). Consequently,\n\
    the blue water footprint (irrigation water) of purple garlic decreased from 0.287\
    \ m3 kg−1 of ND\ntreatment to 0.173 m3 kg−1 of T70. The ND treatment achieved\
    \ the best combination between yield\nand bulb calibre with high commercial value\
    \ in both seasons. In 2015, the deﬁcit treatments reached a\nsimilar distribution\
    \ of calibres than that of the ND. However, the unfavourable climatic conditions\n\
    of 2016 aﬀected the distribution of calibres of ORDI treatments, shifting to calibres\
    \ with lower price.\nThus, the average proﬁtability of the ND treatment was around\
    \ 9800 € ha−1 vs. 6000 € ha−1 of T70.\nReaching the same total production of garlic\
    \ in the productive area of purple garlic in CLM by using\nthe T70 strategy instead\
    \ of ND, it would be possible to reduce the irrigation requirements by around\n\
    37% with reductions in percolation due to better use of rainfall water. Nevertheless,\
    \ the bulbs would\nbe smaller, decreasing the price of the harvests and aﬀecting\
    \ the ﬁnal proﬁtability of the farms. This\nwould be higher in wet years due to\
    \ a larger area of the farm being cultivated with lower stressed\ngarlic. In contrast,\
    \ in dry years like 2016, proﬁtability would decrease notably aﬀecting the proﬁtability\n\
    of the farms. This may diminish the interest in this methodology in a highly proﬁtable\
    \ crop such as\ngarlic, which requires high investment for its cultivation.\n\
    Barley\nThis experiment was similar to the previous one and was conducted during\
    \ 2015, 2016 and 2017\nseasons in Albacete (Spain) [154]. Five irrigation water\
    \ volumes (one with no deﬁcit “ND”, and four\nlimited volumes of available irrigation\
    \ water, corresponding to 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”,\nand 70% of IN =\
    \ 2500 m3ha−1) were evaluated. As an average, ORDI achieved higher yields for\
    \ the\nwater received (between 9040 kg ha−1 of the ND treatment and 6339 kg ha−1\
    \ of the T70), enhancing\nirrigation water productivity (from 2.75 kg m−3 of the\
    \ ND up to 3.64 kg m−3 of the T80). Accordingly,\nthe barley blue water footprint\
    \ was reduced, evolving from 0.360 m3 kg−1 of the ND to 0.275 m3 kg−1\nof the\
    \ T80. All the treatments fulﬁlled the quality requirements demanded by the malt\
    \ industry, which\nwere not aﬀected by the ORDI strategy. As expected, the average\
    \ proﬁtability of ND treatment in the\narea (average 281.84 € ha−1) was higher\
    \ than the others (average 260.63 € ha−1 for T80). Nevertheless,\nthe application\
    \ of the T80 methodology in all the barley area cultivated in the Eastern CLM\
    \ region\ninstead of ND during the three experimental years would involve a 30.1%\
    \ reduction in irrigation water\nand a 13.3% increase in water productivity. This\
    \ water saving (38.3 hm3 in three years) could be used\nto replenish the Eastern\
    \ CLM aquifer (at risk of over exploitation), reducing the pumping energy costs\n\
    and improving the ecosystems depending on the aquifer, and/or to supply water\
    \ to more proﬁtable\ncrops in the area improving the economy of the region.\n\
    Barley, Maize and Onion\nThis experiment was conducted in2014 and 2015 in Albacete\
    \ (Spain) [134]. The objective was to\ncompare the proﬁtability of a 240 ha irrigated\
    \ commercial farm considering two irrigation strategies.\nThe traditional strategy\
    \ (T) consisted of applying full irrigation (F treatments) to a distribution of\n\
    crops (barley, maize and onion), considering several volumes of irrigation water\
    \ (from 2000 up to\n8000 m3 ha−1, varying the total area dedicated to each crop\
    \ by using the direct solution algorithm\nobtained by MOPECO) and four market\
    \ price scenarios considering a water cost of 0.12 € m−3.\nDepending on the availability\
    \ of irrigation water, the MOPECO strategy (M) consisted of applying to the\n\
    same crops full irrigation or the combinations of water deficit per growing stage\
    \ determined by ORDI\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n16 of 26\nmethodology (O treatments).\
    \ The optimal global deficits were: 30% ETm for barley (ETa/ETm = 0.7), 10%\n\
    ETm for maize (ETa/ETm = 0.9), and 10% ETm for onion (ETa/ETm = 0.9). For low\
    \ availabilities of\nirrigation water (between 2000 and 5000 m3 ha−1), the M strategy\
    \ achieved a proﬁtability up to 8.2%\nhigher than T in the most favourable scenario,\
    \ but the average for all the scenarios was around 2.8%,\nwhich was much lower\
    \ than expected (8.0%) according to the simulations carried out by MOPECO\nusing\
    \ historic climatic and economic data. Despite the lower increase in proﬁtability,\
    \ in all the cases,\nthe WP of the ORDI treatments was higher (average 12.4% for\
    \ barley; 3.6% for maize; and 1.4% for\nonion). The causes of these results were\
    \ the drought conditions of the two experimental years during\nspring time that\
    \ increased the amount of water required by barley, the unfavourable climatic\
    \ conditions\nduring 2015 for onion and maize that decreased their yields and\
    \ the price progression during both\nseasons (close to unproﬁtable values for\
    \ onion in the ﬁrst year). Thus, barley, a priori, the crop which\ncould yield\
    \ a water saving (because of its low proﬁtability) required more water than forecast\
    \ and\ndecreased the availability of water for the other two crops. This work\
    \ brought to light the necessity of\nmodifying ORDI, resulting in the development\
    \ of ORDI for limited volumes of water [138]. For higher\navailabilities of irrigation\
    \ water (between 5000 and 8000 m3 ha−1), the results of F and O scenarios\nwere\
    \ similar since there was suﬃcient water for avoiding deﬁcit irrigation.\n4. Discussion\n\
    The above study cases described the response of a wide range of crops to two diﬀerent\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling approaches under semi-arid conditions: one based on real\
    \ time SWC measurements and\nthe other based on simulation models.\nThe automatic\
    \ irrigation system (AIS) eﬃciently processed and sent the user real-time ﬁeld\
    \ data\n(SWC, applied irrigation volume, and weather data). It also activated/deactivated\
    \ the electrovalves\nthat control the beginning and end of irrigation events.\
    \ To this end, the AIS eﬀectively combined the\ninformation collected by a wireless\
    \ sensor (WS) network with climate information available through a\nweb platform\
    \ to actuate the electrovalves using ICT technologies. Likewise, all recorded\
    \ data were\nstored in the cloud, being accessible anywhere/anytime for advisory\
    \ services to farmers.\nAIS can be adapted to diﬀerent crops. In this work, it\
    \ was implemented in woody crops (peach\nand nectarine). A deﬁcit irrigation strategy\
    \ was applied, achieving savings of around 30% in water,\nenergy and labour costs\
    \ compared to the conventional irrigation system.\nIt should be considered that\
    \ the implementation of AIS in commercial farms involves the study of\nthe spatial\
    \ variability of the soil properties before the installation of the soil water\
    \ sensors in order to\nselect the monitoring point or points. A minimum of three\
    \ probes is required to adequately represent\nthe wet bulb. Hence, robust and\
    \ cheap sensors for soil, plant, and atmosphere measurements are\nneeded to promote\
    \ the adoption of AIS in farms.\nRegarding weather variables, real time and forecasted\
    \ weather information provided by public\nand private weather services could be\
    \ integrated in the irrigation schedule (rainfall time, intensity,\nETo) to improve\
    \ its accuracy [155,156].\nSensor, hardware and software providers are currently\
    \ involved in a process to enable the design\nof customized AIS based on SCADA\
    \ or other middleware [155] to process inputs and operate irrigation\nnetworks\
    \ in real time. Additionally, APPs implemented on hand-pocket smart devices will\
    \ provide\ndecision makers with an easy access to real-time data [62,156].\nLikewise,\
    \ the WS networks, as well as the other technological components of AIS, require\n\
    supervision and maintenance and a minimum level of knowledge for their handling\
    \ and interpretation\nof the data. If the user does not have such knowledge, he/she\
    \ should use technical advisory services.\nThe investment in the AIS (from 3000\
    \ €, investment + operation) and the need for knowledge are the\nmain limiting\
    \ factor for commercial application of AIS. These deterrents have also been highlighted\
    \ in\nother studies carried out in Australia, USA or European countries, such\
    \ as Italy and Portugal [61,157–159].\nIn these analyses, authors state that farmers\
    \ tend to maintain traditional agricultural practices and are\nusually reluctant\
    \ to adopt new technologies [157]. In addition, the maintenance costs required\
    \ is also\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n17 of 26\na limiting factor for the incorporation\
    \ of these new technologies [157]. Hence, knowledge exchange\nbetween researchers,\
    \ farmers and other stakeholders is recommended to encourage the technological\n\
    development and automation of irrigated agriculture [61].If this approach is properly\
    \ transferred\nto the irrigation community, it will be a great step forward in\
    \ the eﬃcient use of water in irrigated\nagriculture. Thus, in regions with permanent\
    \ water scarcity and high-value crops (e.g., Mediterranean\nenvironments), AIS\
    \ can be worthwhile by underpinning highly proﬁtable production with lower water\n\
    endowments than traditional systems.\nFurthermore, models like MOPECO are the\
    \ core of decision support systems (DSS) that strengthen\nfarmers’ ability to\
    \ preserve their proﬁtability under low water availability conditions. MOPECO\n\
    provides valuable information to improve crops distributions before planting and\
    \ optimize irrigation\nscheduling in order to maximize water productivity. Additionally,\
    \ at the level of water resource\nmanagers, it is also an adequate tool to analyse\
    \ the eﬀects of water policies on the agricultural sector.\nMOPECO highlights\
    \ the importance of suitable management of irrigation water through proper\nmaintenance\
    \ and use of the irrigation system, as well as determining the most suitable irrigation\n\
    scheduling. In addition, under limited water availability conditions, MOPECO reduces\
    \ water allocation\nfor lower proﬁtable crops (i.e., barley) and reallocates them\
    \ to more proﬁtable crops.\nFarmers sometimes solve the lack of uniformity of\
    \ their irrigation systems by supplying larger\namounts of irrigation water than\
    \ that required by crops. This strategy is evidently not justiﬁable from\nan environmental\
    \ point of view, especially in areas where water is scarce. However, if water\
    \ cost is low\nand/or the water authority does not oﬀer any incentives to save\
    \ water, farmers may use this strategy\nbecause it is easier than evaluating their\
    \ irrigation system.\nIn addition to the lack of uniformity, irrigation schedules\
    \ must be overestimated considering\nevaporation and drift losses in order to\
    \ provide farmers with realistic values but avoiding percolation\nat least in\
    \ mostof the ﬁeld. These questions are even more signiﬁcant when proposing farmers\
    \ apply\nregulated deﬁcit irrigation methodologies in annual crops.\nMOPECO increases\
    \ crop WP as a way to increase the proﬁtability of farms by using the ORDI\nmethodology.\
    \ The drop in yield per unit of area is compensated for by a larger irrigated\
    \ area with a\nhigher WP, using the same amount of water within the farm. Consequently,\
    \ ORDI does not decrease\nthe amount of water used but increases the yield per\
    \ unit of water volume supplied to the crop.\nThis evidence has also been shown\
    \ in previous works carried out in Australia, Spain, Morocco, and\nthe Middle\
    \ East. In these studies, adopting eﬃcient irrigation systems has led to higher\
    \ water use\neﬃciencies but this water conservation has been used to expand the\
    \ irrigated area or to change to more\nproﬁtable crops [157–161].\nNevertheless,\
    \ the eﬀect of ORDI on the quality parameters of certain crops, such as horticultural\n\
    ones, must be analysed before advising farmers to use it. Thus, in crops such\
    \ as garlic or onion,\nORDI increased WP but the decrease in the size of bulbs\
    \ reduced their proﬁtability per unit of yield,\nquestioning the suitability of\
    \ this methodology in this type of crops. Moreover, the increase in the\ncultivated\
    \ area generates higher costs that must also be considered, although the cost\
    \ per unit of area\nis lower (lower amount of water, fertilizers, harvest costs,\
    \ etc.). Consequently, an economic analysis\nvalidated under real cropping conditions\
    \ is required in these cases.\nORDI can be useful for farms where the amount of\
    \ irrigation water is limited. The application of\nORDI in garlic and barley under\
    \ real management conditions showed an increase in WP, a reduced\nwater footprint\
    \ and a clear increase in the proﬁtability of farms and barley cropping areas\
    \ (and probably\nother cereals or low proﬁtable crops). Transferring this methodology\
    \ to the productive sector involves\nadapting these kinds of tools to the skills\
    \ and necessities of farmers and technicians.\nApplying models such as MOPECO\
    \ requires calibration and validation processes before use,\nas well as the availability\
    \ of local climatic data (public or private) and the installation of irrigation\n\
    control devices (ﬂow meters and soil moisture sensors), the number of which may\
    \ vary depending\non the total ﬁeld area and its soil uniformity, using at least\
    \ one monitoring point at two depths in\nthe most representative area of the ﬁeld\
    \ i.e., at the location of the major roots depth concentration\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n18 of 26\nand at maximum root depth for controlling percolation. All these\
    \ aspects entail costs for both the\npublic administration and farmers themselves\
    \ (individuals or associations), which maybe unaﬀordable\nfor certain farms. Thus,\
    \ in addition to developingthe tools and training the farmers and technicians,\n\
    the total cost of the system is around 4650 € + taxes + installation.\nTherefore,\
    \ the positive results of the advanced technologies presented (AIS and DSS) are\
    \ not\nwithout cost. They require investment in equipment, and expenditure on\
    \ operation and maintenance,\nas well as qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services.\
    \ Likewise, they need robust sensors, as well as\nthe availability of advanced\
    \ support services. In the case that such conditions are accomplished, these\n\
    technologies will only be able to provide value to farms with low water availability,\
    \ high proﬁtability,\nand substantial technical-economic capacity.\nBoth irrigation\
    \ programming approaches (AIS and DSS) are adequate tools to use irrigation water\n\
    eﬃciently only if they are properly implemented in high uniformity irrigation\
    \ networks. In irrigation\nsystems with no accurate hydraulic design and poor\
    \ maintenance (e.g., emitter clogging) water will\nnever be used eﬃciently no\
    \ matter how good the available irrigation management tools are.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This work reviews the main variables aﬀecting optimal irrigation scheduling and\
    \ their\ninterrelationships. Two approaches to irrigation scheduling conducted\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast\nSpain are presented: one based on real time\
    \ crop monitoring applied to woody crops at the farm scale\nand the other, for\
    \ arable crops, applicable at the regional, irrigation district, and farm scales,\
    \ based on\nwater management models.\nThe analysis of both evaluated case studies\
    \ shows that computer support and ICTs, availability\nof meteorological information\
    \ and crop data during the growing season, sensors, and irrigation\nprogrammers\
    \ among other elements are required to provide optimal irrigation scheduling solutions\n\
    and improved resource allocation under water scarcity conditions. Additionally,\
    \ to succeed in the\nadoption of these new water management technologies, well\
    \ designed and maintained hydraulic\nfacilities are needed.\nThis implies investment\
    \ and maintenance costs, which could make them\nunsuitable for low proﬁtability\
    \ farms.\nIn addition, adopting these approaches requires from the users technical\
    \ training and willingness\nto accept irrigation schedules based not only on personal\
    \ experience but also on data-driven\ndecision-making processes. Hence, irrigation\
    \ advisory services (public or private) can play a key role\nin driving this technology\
    \ change in the irrigation sector. More robust and cheaper sensors would also\n\
    contribute in this way.\nTherefore, to date, the return of these technologies\
    \ is worth the investments and costs required to use\nthem in the case of farms\
    \ with low water availability, high proﬁtability, and relevant technical-economic\n\
    capacity.\nSociety, as an end beneﬁciary, may also play a key role in this technological\
    \ change.\nThe demand for sustainable crops is closely linked to optimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling, which could raise\nthe price of agricultural products and thus tip\
    \ the balance in favour of the implementation of ICTs in\nirrigated agriculture.\n\

    \ spatio-temporal variations of crop\nmorphological and physiological status and\
    \ supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison\nwith multispectral\
    \ imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable\n\
    of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility\
    \ outside of\nthe scientiﬁc community, hyperspectral images have not been widely\
    \ used in precision agriculture.\nIn recent years, diﬀerent mini-sized and low-cost\
    \ airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall\nMicro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD\
    \ 185-Fireﬂy) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI).\n\
    Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications.\
    \ Meanwhile,\nthe acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery\
    \ still remain a challenging research\ntopic (e.g., large data volume, high data\
    \ dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is\nhence beneﬁcial to\
    \ conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology\n\
    (e.g., diﬀerent platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing\
    \ hyperspectral\ninformation, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in\
    \ agricultural applications. Publications\nover the past 30 years in hyperspectral\
    \ imaging technology and applications in agriculture were\nthus reviewed.\nThe\
    \ imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in\nthe literature,\
    \ were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for diﬀerent applications\n\
    (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics,\
    \ and crop classiﬁcation)\nwere also evaluated. This review is intended to assist\
    \ agricultural researchers and practitioners to\nbetter understand the strengths\
    \ and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications\nand promote\
    \ the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral\n\
    imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.\nKeywords: precision\
    \ agriculture; remote sensing; hyperspectral imaging; platforms and sensors;\n\

    \ challenges posed by a range of stressors,\nincluding a rapidly growing population,\
    \ the depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution,\ncrop diseases,\
    \ and climate change. Precision agriculture is a promising approach to address\
    \ these\nchallenges through improving farming practices, e.g., adaptive inputs\
    \ (e.g., water and fertilizer),\nensured outputs (e.g., crop yield and biomass),\
    \ and reduced environmental impacts. Remote sensing\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659;\

    \ and crops and providing useful information for\nsite-speciﬁc management practices\
    \ [1,2]. There are two types of remote sensing technologies given the\nsource\
    \ of energy, passive (e.g., optical) and active remote sensing (e.g., LiDAR and\
    \ Radar). Passive\noptical remote sensing is usually further divided into two\
    \ groups based on the spectral resolutions\nof sensors, multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing [3]. Multispectral imaging is facilitated\nby collecting spectral\
    \ signals in a few discrete bands, each spanning a broad spectral range from tens\n\
    to hundreds of nanometers. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging detects spectral\
    \ signals in a series of\ncontinuous channels with a narrow spectral bandwidth\
    \ (e.g., typically below 10 nm); therefore, it can\ncapture ﬁne-scale spectral\
    \ features of targets that otherwise could be compromised [4].\nMultispectral\
    \ images (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel 2, and SPOT images) have been widely used in\n\
    agricultural studies to retrieve various crop and soil attributes, such as crop\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nbiomass, yield, and soil degradation [5–10]. However,\
    \ due to the limitations in spectral resolution,\nthe accuracy of the retrieved\
    \ variables is often limited, and early signals of crop stresses (e.g., nutrient\n\
    deﬁciency, crop disease) cannot be eﬀectively detected in a timely manner [11].\n\
    Hyperspectral\nimages (e.g., Hyperion, CASI, and Headwall Micro-Hyperspec) with\
    \ hundreds of bands can capture\nmore detailed spectral responses; hence, it is\
    \ more capable of detecting subtle variations of ground\ncovers and their changes\
    \ over time. Therefore, hyperspectral imagery can be used to address the\naforementioned\
    \ challenges and facilitate more accurate and timely detection of crop physiological\n\
    status [12,13]. Previous studies have also demonstrated the superior performance\
    \ of hyperspectral\nover multispectral images in monitoring vegetation properties,\
    \ such as estimating the leaf area\nindex (LAI) [14], discriminating crop types\
    \ [15], retrieving crop biomass [16], and assessing leaf\nnitrogen content [17].\
    \ Despite its outstanding performance, hyperspectral imaging has been utilized\n\
    comparatively less in operational agricultural applications in the past few decades\
    \ due to the high cost\nof the sensors and imaging missions, and various technical\
    \ challenges (e.g., low signal-to-noise ratio\nand large data volume) [18–21].\
    \ Although ground-based hyperspectral reﬂectance data can be quickly\nmeasured\
    \ using a spectroradiometer (e.g., ASD Field Spec, Analytical Spectral Devices\
    \ Inc., Boulder,\nCO, USA) and have been widely used for observing canopy- and\
    \ leaf-level spectral features [22–24],\nsuch ground-based measurements are limited\
    \ to a few numbers of ﬁeld sites, and they cannot capture\nspatial variability\
    \ across large areas. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging sensors are more convenient\
    \ to\nacquire spatial variability of spectral information across a region.\nIn\
    \ recent years, a wide range of mini-sized and low-cost hyperspectral sensors\
    \ have been developed\nand are available for commercial use, such as Micro- and\
    \ Nano-Hyperspec (Headwall Photonics Inc.,\nBoston, MA, USA), HySpex VNIR (HySpex,\
    \ Skedsmo, Skjetten, Norway), and FireﬂEYE (Cubert GmbH,\nUlm, Germany) [11,25].\
    \ These sensors can be mounted on manned or unmanned airborne platforms\n(e.g.,\
    \ airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) for acquiring hyperspectral\
    \ images\nand supporting various monitoring missions [13,26,27]. In addition,\
    \ new spaceborne hyperspectral\nsensors have been launched recently, such as the\
    \ DESIS—launched in 2018 [28]—and PRISMA—\nlaunched in 2019 [29]—or will be launched\
    \ in the next few years, such as EnMAP, with scheduled\nlaunching in 2020 [30,31].\
    \ Overall, increasingly more airborne or spaceborne hyperspectral images\nhave\
    \ become available, bringing unprecedented opportunities for better monitoring\
    \ of ground targets,\nespecially for better investigation of crop and soil variabilities\
    \ and supporting precision agriculture.\nTherefore, a literature search was performed\
    \ to examine if more research in using hyperspectral\nimaging for agricultural\
    \ purposes had been published in recent years. Both Web of Science and\nGoogle\
    \ Scholar were used for conducting the literature search with topics or keywords,\
    \ including\nhyperspectral, imaging, agriculture, or farming, and publication\
    \ over a 30-year time span (1990 to 2020).\nThe searched results were further\
    \ veriﬁed to ensure that each publication falls within the scope of\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging for agriculture applications. It was found that there was an increasing\
    \ number\nof publications in recent years that used hyperspectral imaging for\
    \ agricultural applications (Figure 1).\nSubstantially more studies have been\
    \ published in the recent decade (e.g., 245 articles published in\n2011–2020)\
    \ than that in the previous one (e.g., 97 published in 2001–2010).\nRemote Sens.\

    \ resolution, operational \ncomplexity, and mission cost. It will be beneficial\
    \ to summarize various platforms in terms of these \nfeatures to support the selection\

    \ imagery is acquired, pre-processing is the step for obtaining accurate spectral\
    \ \ninformation. Several procedures need to be carried out during pre-processing\
    \ (usually implemented \nin a specialized remote sensing software), including\

    \ geometric correction. Although these are standard processing steps for \nmost\

    \ Global Positioning System \n(GPS) signals for proper geometric correction, the\
    \ measurement of real-time solar radiance for \naccurate spectral correction).\
    \ There are no standardized protocols for all sensors due to the limited \navailability\

    \ studies to address these challenges \n[12,19,32,33]. Therefore, it is essential\
    \ to review these approaches to support other researchers for \nmore accurate\

    \ hyperspectral images, a robust and eﬃcient analytical method is required\nfor\
    \ analyzing the tremendous amount of information contained in the images (e.g.,\
    \ spectral, spatial,\nand textural features) and extracting target properties\
    \ (e.g., crop and soil characteristics). Previous\nstudies have used a suite of\
    \ analytical methods, including empirical regression (e.g., linear regression,\n\
    partial least square regression (PLSR), and multi-variable regression (MLR)),\
    \ radiative transfer\nmodelling (RTM, e.g., PROSPECT and PROSAIL), machine learning\
    \ (e.g., random forest (RF)),\nand deep learning (e.g., convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN)) [34–37]. These methods have been\ndeveloped based on diﬀerent theories\
    \ and have diﬀerent operational complexity, computation eﬃciency,\nand performance\
    \ accuracy. Therefore, it is essential to review the strengths and limitations\
    \ of these\nmethods and help to choose the appropriate one(s) for speciﬁc research\
    \ purposes. Using hyperspectral\ninformation, researchers have investigated a\
    \ wide range of agricultural features. Some popular ones\ninclude crop water content,\
    \ LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, pests and disease, plant height,\nphenological\
    \ information, soil moisture, and soil organic matter content [11,38]. It will\
    \ also be valuable\nto review the performances of hyperspectral imaging in these\
    \ studies and further explore the potential\nof this technology for monitoring\
    \ other agricultural features. Lastly, challenges of using hyperspectral\nimaging\
    \ for precision agriculture, together with future research directions, are discussed.\
    \ A few\nprevious review articles have discussed some of these topics to some\
    \ extent [11,38,39]. More details\nand contributions of this review will be discussed\
    \ in each speciﬁc section. Overall, this review aims to\nexamine the main procedures\
    \ in collecting and utilizing hyperspectral images for diﬀerent agricultural\n\
    applications, to further understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral\
    \ technology, and to\npromote the faster adoption of this valuable technology\
    \ in precision farming.\n2. Hyperspectral Imaging Platforms and Sensors\nHyperspectral\
    \ sensors can be mounted on different platforms, such as satellites, airplanes,\n\
    UAVs, and close-range platforms, to acquire images with different spatial and\
    \ temporal resolutions.\nPlatforms used in the literature were identified and\
    \ summarized over the publication years, aiming to\nfind, if any, the platforms\
    \ that had been used more frequently in a specific time period, and the results\n\
    are shown in Figure 2. Airplanes have been the most widely used platforms for\
    \ hyperspectral imaging\nin agriculture (Figure 2). Approximately 30 articles\
    \ that used airplanes were published every five years\nstarting from 2001 (e.g.,\
    \ 27 publications in 2001–2005 and 38 in 2006–2010). In comparison, satellite-based\n\
    hyperspectral imaging has been used less frequently; approximately 20 or fewer\
    \ articles were published\nin all five-year periods. UAVs are popular platforms\
    \ for remote sensing and have been widely used in\nthe last decade for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging in agriculture (e.g., more than 20 publications in 2011–2015 and\n2016–2020).\
    \ Close-range platforms have been the most widely used in the last five years\
    \ (i.e., 2016–2020),\nwith 49 publications (Figure 2). The review in this section\
    \ is structured based on different platforms,\nincluding satellites, airplanes,\
    \ UAVs, and close-range platforms. In contrast to previous articles reviewing\n\
    hyperspectral platforms [20,38,39], the review in this section focuses more on\
    \ recent advancements of\nimaging platforms (e.g., UAVs, helicopters, and close\
    \ range) and their applications to precision farming\n(e.g., weed classification,\
    \ fine-scale evaluation of crop health, pests, and disease).\n2.1. Satellite-Based\
    \ Hyperspectral Imaging\nCompared with a large number of satellite-based multispectral\
    \ sensors (e.g., Landsat,\nSPOT, WorldView, QuickBird, Sentinel-2), there are\
    \ signiﬁcantly fewer hyperspectral sensors.\nEO-1 Hyperion, PROBA-CHRIS, and TianGong-1\
    \ [40] are a few examples of the available satellite\nhyperspectral sensors [20].\
    \ EO-1 Hyperion is the most widely used satellite-based hyperspectral\nsensor\
    \ for agriculture (e.g., more than 40 publications). It collects data in the visible,\
    \ near-infrared,\nand shortwave infrared ranges with a spectral resolution of\
    \ 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m.\nMore sensor speciﬁcations of EO-1 Hyperion\
    \ are given in Table 2. The sensor was in operation\nfrom 2000 to 2017, which\
    \ corresponds to the period having more publications using satellite-based\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging (e.g., 2006 to 2020 in Figure 2). The use of Hyperion data has been\
    \ reported in a\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n6 of 44\nvariety of agricultural\
    \ studies for monitoring diﬀerent crop and soil properties, including detecting\n\
    crop disease [41,42], estimating crop properties (e.g., chlorophyll, LAI, biomass)\
    \ [43–45], assessing crop\nresidues [46,47], classifying crop types [48], and\
    \ investigating soil features [49,50]. A few featured ones\ninclude Wu et al.\
    \ [45], who estimated vegetation chlorophyll content and LAI in a mixed agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld using Hyperion data and evaluated spectral bands that are sensitive to these\
    \ vegetation properties.\nCamacho Velasco et al. [48] used Hyperion hyperspectral\
    \ imagery and diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms\n(e.g., spectral angle mapper\
    \ and adaptive coherence estimator) for identifying ﬁve types of crops\n(e.g.,\
    \ oil palm, rubber, grass for grazing, citrus, and sugar cane) in Colombia. Gomez\
    \ et al. [49] predicted\nsoil organic carbon (SOC) using both spectroradiometer\
    \ data and a Hyperion hyperspectral image,\nand they found that using Hyperion\
    \ data resulted in a lower accuracy compared with results derived\nfrom spectroradiometer\

    \ EO-1 \nHyperion, PROBA-CHRIS, and TianGong-1 [40] are a few examples of the\
    \ available satellite \nhyperspectral sensors [20]. EO-1 Hyperion is the most\
    \ widely used satellite-based hyperspectral \nsensor for agriculture (e.g., more\
    \ than 40 publications). It collects data in the visible, near-infrared, \nand\
    \ shortwave infrared ranges with a spectral resolution of 10 nm and a spatial\
    \ resolution of 30 m. \nMore sensor specifications of EO-1 Hyperion are given\
    \ in Table 2. The sensor was in operation from \n2000 to 2017, which corresponds\
    \ to the period having more publications using satellite-based \nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging (e.g., 2006 to 2020 in Figure 2). The use of Hyperion data has been\
    \ reported in \na variety of agricultural studies for monitoring different crop\
    \ and soil properties, including detecting \ncrop disease [41,42], estimating\
    \ crop properties (e.g., chlorophyll, LAI, biomass) [43–45], assessing \ncrop\
    \ residues [46,47], classifying crop types [48], and investigating soil features\
    \ [49,50]. A few \nfeatured ones include Wu et al. [45], who estimated vegetation\
    \ chlorophyll content and LAI in a \nmixed agricultural field using Hyperion data\
    \ and evaluated spectral bands that are sensitive to these \nvegetation properties.\
    \ Camacho Velasco et al. [48] used Hyperion hyperspectral imagery and \ndifferent\
    \ classification algorithms (e.g., spectral angle mapper and adaptive coherence\
    \ estimator) for \nidentifying five types of crops (e.g., oil palm, rubber, grass\
    \ for grazing, citrus, and sugar cane) in \nColombia. Gomez et al. [49] predicted\
    \ soil organic carbon (SOC) using both spectroradiometer data \nand a Hyperion\
    \ hyperspectral image, and they found that using Hyperion data resulted in a lower\
    \ \naccuracy compared with results derived from spectroradiometer data \nStudies\
    \ have also been conducted to compare the performances of Hyperion hyperspectral\
    \ \nimagery with multispectral imagery for estimating crop properties or classifying\
    \ crop types. For \ninstance, Mariotto et al. [15] compared Hyperion hyperspectral\
    \ imagery with Landsat multispectral \nimagery for the estimation of crop productivity\
    \ and the classification of crop types. The authors \nreported better performances\
    \ of using hyperspectral imagery than using Landsat imagery for both \nresearch\
    \ purposes. Similarly, Bostan et al. [51] compared Hyperion hyperspectral imagery\
    \ with \nLandsat multispectral imagery for crop classification and also found\
    \ that higher classification \naccuracy can be achieved by using hyperspectral\
    \ imagery. \nFigure 2. Number of publications that used diﬀerent hyperspectral\
    \ imaging platforms over time.\nStudies have also been conducted to compare the\
    \ performances of Hyperion hyperspectral imagery\nwith multispectral imagery for\
    \ estimating crop properties or classifying crop types. For instance,\nMariotto\
    \ et al. [15] compared Hyperion hyperspectral imagery with Landsat multispectral\
    \ imagery for\nthe estimation of crop productivity and the classiﬁcation of crop\
    \ types. The authors reported better\nperformances of using hyperspectral imagery\
    \ than using Landsat imagery for both research purposes.\nSimilarly, Bostan et\
    \ al. [51] compared Hyperion hyperspectral imagery with Landsat multispectral\n\
    imagery for crop classiﬁcation and also found that higher classiﬁcation accuracy\
    \ can be achieved by\nusing hyperspectral imagery.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\

    \ is another commonly used satellite-based hyperspectral sensor that was launched\n\
    in 2001.\nSpeciﬁc studies, such as Verger et al. [57], utilized PROBA-CHRIS data\
    \ for retrieving\nLAI, the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover), and the fraction\
    \ of absorbed photosynthetically\nactive radiation (FAPAR) in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Antony et al. [58] identiﬁed three growth stages\nof wheat using multi-angle\
    \ PROBA-CHRIS images and found the optimal view angles for the\nidentiﬁcation.\
    \ Casa et al. [59] evaluated the performance of airborne Multispectral Infrared\
    \ Visible\nImaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) data and spaceborne PROBA-CHRIS data for\
    \ investigating soil texture,\nand they found that these two data have similar\
    \ performances, although the PROBA-CHRIS data have\na lower spatial resolution.\n\
    There are a few other satellite-based hyperspectral sensors that have not been\
    \ commonly used\nin an agricultural environment. For instance, Hyperspectral Imager\
    \ (HySI) is a hyperspectral sensor\nequipped on the Indian Microsatellite-1 (IMS-1)\
    \ launched in 2008 [60]. It collects spectral signals in the\nrange of 400–950\
    \ nm with a spatial resolution of 550 m at nadir [61]. HySI imagery has been used\
    \ to\nmap diﬀerent agricultural features, such as soil moisture and soil salinity\
    \ [62]. It has also been used for\ncrop classiﬁcation [63]. However, this data\
    \ has not been widely used in precision farming, which is\nprobably due to the\
    \ low spatial resolution and limited data availability. The Hyperspectral Imager\n\
    for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is another spaceborne hyperspectral sensor that takes\
    \ images with a\nspectral range from 380 to 960 nm at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 90 m [64]. This sensor was mainly designed\nto sample the coastal ocean and\
    \ operated from 2009 to 2015.\nIn recent years, several spaceborne hyperspectral\
    \ sensors have been launched or scheduled for\nlaunching in the next few years.\
    \ For instance, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing\nImaging Spectrometer\
    \ (DESIS), a hyperspectral sensor mounted on the International Space Station,\n\
    was launched in 2018 [65]. This sensor acquires images in the range from 400 to\
    \ 1000 nm with a spectral\nresolution of 2.5 nm and a spatial resolution of 30\
    \ m. The Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) is a\nJapanese hyperspectral sensor\
    \ that is also onboard the International Space Station [66]. It was launched\n\
    in 2019 and collects data in the range from 400 to 2500 nm with a spatial resolution\
    \ of 20 m and a\ntemporal resolution of 2 to 60 days [20]. Hyperspectral Precursor\
    \ and Application Mission (PRISMA)\nis an Italian hyperspectral mission with the\
    \ sensor launched in March 2019. Its spectral resolution is\n12 nm in the range\
    \ of 400-2500 nm (~250 bands in visible to shortwave infrared). Its hyperspectral\n\
    imagery has a spatial resolution of 30 and 5 m for the panchromatic band [67].\
    \ The Environmental\nMapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyperspectral\
    \ satellite mission that is still in\nthe development and production phase [68].\
    \ The EnMAP sensor will collect data from the visible to\nthe shortwave infrared\
    \ range with a spatial resolution of 30 m. It is planned to be launched in 2020.\n\
    The Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM) is a\
    \ joint mission by\nIsraeli and Italian space agencies, and the satellite is scheduled\
    \ to be launched in 2022 [69]. This sensor\nwill collect hyperspectral images\
    \ with a spatial resolution of 10 m in the spectral range of 400–2500 nm\nand\
    \ panchromatic images with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m [70]. HyspIRI is another\
    \ hyperspectral\nmission that is also at the study stage [71]. This sensor will\
    \ collect data in the 380 to 2500 nm range\nwith an interval of 10 nm and a spatial\
    \ resolution of 60 m.\nAlthough the actual PRISMA, EnMAP, and HyspIRI data are\
    \ not yet available, researchers\nhave simulated the images using other data and\
    \ tested the performance of the simulated images for\ninvestigating diﬀerent vegetation\
    \ and soil features. For instance, Malec et al. [72], Siegmann et al. [73],\n\
    and Locherer et al. [74] simulated EnMAP imagery using diﬀerent airborne or spaceborne\
    \ images and\napplied the simulated images for investigating diﬀerent crop and\
    \ soil properties. Bachmann et al. [75]\nproduced an image using the EnMAP’s end-to-end\
    \ simulation tool and examined the uncertainties\nassociated with spectral and\
    \ radiometric calibration. Castaldi et al. [76] simulated data of four\ncurrent\
    \ (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2\
    \ MultiSpectral\nInstrument (MSI)) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA, and HyspIRI)\
    \ sensors using a soil spectral\nlibrary and compared their performance for estimating\
    \ soil properties. Castaldi et al. [77] used PRISMA\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    9 of 44\ndata that were simulated with lab-measured spectral data for estimating\
    \ clay content and attempted to\nreduce the inﬂuence of soil moisture on the estimation\
    \ of clay.\nPrevious studies have conﬁrmed the good performance of satellite-based\
    \ hyperspectral sensors for\nstudying agricultural features; however, several\
    \ factors could potentially aﬀect the broad applications\nof these data in precision\
    \ farming, including the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and data quality.\n\
    The detection and monitoring of many agricultural features, such as crop disease,\
    \ pest infestation,\nand nutrient status, require high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\
    Most of the satellite-based\nhyperspectral sensors have medium spatial resolutions,\
    \ such as 17 or 36 m for PROBA-CHRIS;\n30 m for Hyperion, PRISMA, and EnMAP, DESIS;\
    \ and 60 m for HyspIRI. Previous studies have\nindicated that such spatial resolutions\
    \ are not suﬃcient for precision farming applications [20,49].\nTo overcome such\
    \ limitations, researchers have attempted to pansharpen hyperspectral images,\
    \ aiming\nto improve spatial resolution [73,78–80]. Loncan et al. [81] also reviewed\
    \ diﬀerent pansharpening\nmethods for generating high-spatial resolution hyperspectral\
    \ images.\nTemporal resolution is another factor that could potentially limit\
    \ the applications of satellite-based\nhyperspectral images to precision agriculture.\
    \ Most of the satellite-based sensors have a long revisit\ncycle (e.g., typically\
    \ around two weeks), and thus early signals of crop stress (e.g., disease and\n\
    pest) may be missed. This limitation can be further aggravated by unfavorable\
    \ weather conditions\n(e.g., cloud contamination). Lastly, low data quality is\
    \ also an issue that can aﬀect the performance of\nsatellite-based hyperspectral\
    \ imaging for investigating agricultural features. A low signal-to-noise ratio\n\
    is a well-known issue of Hyperion data (e.g., in the shortwave infrared (SWIR)\
    \ range), which has aﬀected\nthe accuracy of retrieving diﬀerent agricultural\
    \ features [20]. For instance, Asner and Heidebrecht [82],\nGomez et al. [49],\
    \ and Weng et al. [83] found that the low signal-to-noise ratio inﬂuenced the\
    \ accuracies\nof estimating non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil cover, soil\
    \ organic matter, and soil salinity,\nrespectively. Future satellite-based hyperspectral\
    \ missions are expected to solve the data quality issue.\n2.2. Airplane-Based\
    \ Hyperspectral Imaging\nAirborne hyperspectral imaging has been widely used to\
    \ collect hyperspectral imagery for\ndiﬀerent monitoring purposes (e.g., for agriculture\
    \ or forestry). The ﬁrst hyperspectral sensor was an\nairborne visible/infrared\
    \ imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) that was developed and utilized in 1987 [84].\n\
    It collects spectral signals in 224 bands in the visible to SWIR range (Table\
    \ 2). Researchers have applied\nAVIRIS data to help understand a wide range of\
    \ agricultural features, such as investigating vegetation\nproperties (e.g., yield,\
    \ LAI, chlorophyll, and water content) [85–88], analyzing soil properties [89],\n\
    evaluating crop health or identifying pest infestation [90–92], and mapping crop\
    \ area or agricultural\ntillage practices [93,94].\nBesides AVIRIS, the Compact\
    \ Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), Hyperspectral Mapper\n(HyMap), and AISA\
    \ Eagle are also widely used airborne hyperspectral sensors (Table 2). For instance,\n\
    CASI images have been used for estimating crop chlorophyll content [95], investigating\
    \ crop cover\nfraction [96], classifying weeds [97], and delineating management\
    \ zones [2]. The HyMap imagery\nhas been applied to examining crop biophysical\
    \ and biochemical variables (e.g., LAI, chlorophyll and\nwater content) [98–100],\
    \ detecting plant stress signals [101], and investigating the spatial patterns\
    \ of\nSOC [102]. Regarding AISA Eagle imagery, Ryu et al. [35] and Cilia et al.\
    \ [103] used this data for\nestimating crop nitrogen content, and Ambrus et al.\
    \ [104] used it for estimating biomass.\nSeveral other airborne hyperspectral\
    \ sensors have also been used in previous studies. For instance,\nAVIS images\
    \ were used for investigating a range of vegetation characteristics (e.g., biomass\
    \ and\nchlorophyll) [105], Probe-1 hyperspectral images were used for investigating\
    \ crop residues [106],\nRDACS-H4 hyperspectral images were used for detecting\
    \ crop disease [34], AHS-160 hyperspectral\nsensor was used for mapping SOC [107],\
    \ the SWIR Hyper Spectral Imaging (HSI) sensor was used for\nestimating soil moisture\
    \ [108], the Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) was used for estimating\nwinter\
    \ wheat LAI [109], and airborne prism experiment (APEX) data were used for studying\
    \ the\nrelationship between SOC in croplands and the spectral signals [110].\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n10 of 44\nMost of the aforementioned airborne hyperspectral\
    \ images have been acquired by airplanes at\nmedium to high altitude (e.g., 1–4\
    \ km altitude for CASI, 20 km for AVIRIS), and the acquired images\ngenerally\
    \ having high to medium spatial resolution, such as 4 m for CASI imagery, 5 m\
    \ for HyMap,\nand 20 m for AVIRIS [111–113]. Such spatial resolutions are appropriate\
    \ for mapping many crop and\nsoil features. However, image acquisition usually\
    \ needs to be scheduled months or even years in\nadvance, and ﬂight missions are\
    \ expensive [19]. Furthermore, for some speciﬁc applications, such as\ninvestigating\
    \ species-level or community-level features (e.g., identiﬁcation of weeds or early\
    \ signal\nof crop disease), images with very high spatial resolutions (e.g., sub-meter)\
    \ are preferred [114,115].\nIn addition, due to the unstable nature of airplanes\
    \ as imaging platforms, a gimbal or high-accuracy\ninertial measurement unit (IMU)\
    \ will be required to compensate for the orientation change of the\nairplanes\
    \ or recording the orientation information for subsequent image correction, respectively.\n\
    These factors limited the full application of airborne hyperspectral imaging in\
    \ precision agriculture.\nManned helicopters have also been used as platforms\
    \ for hyperspectral imaging and investigation\nof vegetation features [27,116].\
    \ Helicopters have more ﬂexible ﬂight heights (e.g., 100 m–2 km) than\nairplanes\
    \ and are capable of acquiring high-spatial-resolution images (e.g., sub-meter)\
    \ over large\nareas. An aviation company with a manned helicopter is generally\
    \ needed for the imaging task,\nwhich requires extra funding support and far advanced\
    \ pre-scheduling.\n2.3. UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imaging\nUAV has become a popular\
    \ platform in recent years for remote sensing data acquisition,\nespecially for\
    \ multispectral imaging using digital cameras or multispectral sensors. With the\
    \ increased\navailability of lightweight hyperspectral sensors, researchers have\
    \ experimented on mounting these\nsensors on UAVs to acquire high-spatial-resolution\
    \ hyperspectral imagery [19,117]. Diﬀerent types\nof UAVs, including multi-rotors,\
    \ helicopters, and ﬁxed wings, have been utilized in previous studies\n(Figure\
    \ 3). Compared with manned airplanes and helicopters, UAVs are capable of acquiring\
    \ high-\nspatial-resolution images with a much lower cost and have high ﬂexibility\
    \ in terms of scheduling a\nﬂight mission [118]. Several speciﬁc agricultural\
    \ applications of UAV-based hyperspectral imaging are\nsummarized in Table 3.\n\

    \ sensor [19,32], and the HySpex VNIR [25,131].\nThese hyperspectral sensors contain\
    \ more than 100 bands in the visible-near infrared spectral range\n(Table 2).\
    \ These sensors are small and compact (1–2 kg), thus they can be deployed quickly\
    \ on various\nmanned or unmanned remote sensing platforms. Previous studies conducted\
    \ by Adão et al. [11] and\nLodhi et al. [52] also compared and summarized various\
    \ lightweight hyperspectral sensors.\nA large number of factors need to be considered\
    \ in the application of UAV-based hyperspectral\nimaging, ranging from sensor\
    \ setup and data collection, to image processing. Saari et al. [122] tested\n\
    the feasibility of a UAV-based hyperspectral imaging system for agricultural and\
    \ forest applications\nand discussed several challenges regarding the imaging\
    \ technology (e.g., hardware requirements\nand system settings).\nAasen et al.\
    \ [132] focused on the calibration of images collected with a\nframe-based sensor\
    \ and discussed several challenges related to the use of UAV-based hyperspectral\n\
    imaging for vegetation and crop investigation (e.g., the payload of UAV, signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio, and\nspectral calibration). Habib et al. [120] attempted to perform orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ of UAV-acquired\npushbroom-based hyperspectral imagery with frame-based RGB\
    \ images over an agricultural ﬁeld.\nAdão et al. [11] reviewed applications of\
    \ UAV-based hyperspectral imaging in agriculture and forestry\nand listed several\
    \ hyperspectral sensors that can be mounted on UAVs. The authors also discussed\n\
    several challenges in collecting and analyzing UAV-based hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ such as radiometric\nnoise, the low quality of UAV georeferencing, and a low\
    \ signal-to-noise ratio.\nUAV-based hyperspectral imaging has become more popular\
    \ in recent years; therefore, it is critical to\nreview its strengths and limitations.\

    \ not limited to agricultural applications alone. Different types of UAVs have\
    \ been used as hyperspectral\nimaging platforms, with the two most widely used\
    \ as multi-rotors [130,133,134] and ﬁxed-wing\nplanes [33,120,135]. Slow ﬂights\
    \ at low altitudes are preferred to achieve high-spatial-resolution\nhyperspectral\
    \ imagery with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, a multi-rotor is more competitive\
    \ than\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n12 of 44\nﬁxed-wing planes for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging in terms of ﬂight operation. Speciﬁcally, the multi-rotor\nallows for\
    \ a low ﬂight altitude, ﬂexible ﬂight speed, and vertical takeoﬀ and landing,\
    \ while the\nﬁxed wing requires a minimum ﬂight altitude, speed, and, sometimes,\
    \ accessories for takeoﬀ and\nlanding (e.g., runway, launcher, and parachute).\
    \ A hyperspectral imaging system, which consists\nof a hyperspectral sensor, a\
    \ data processing unit, a GPS, and an IMU, has a considerable weight\n(e.g., 1–3\
    \ kg), thus bringing challenges to the payload capacity of the UAV system and\
    \ its battery\nendurance. The multi-rotors are generally powered by high-performance\
    \ batteries (e.g., LiPo), and most\nhave a short endurance (e.g., less than 20\
    \ min). The endurance can be as short as 3 min [12]. In contrast,\nmany ﬁxed-wing\
    \ UAVs are powered by fuel, thus having a much longer endurance (e.g., 1–10 h)\
    \ [19,135].\nHowever, these ﬁxed-wing planes are mostly large and heavy (e.g.,\
    \ a 5 m wingspan and 14 kg take-oﬀ\nweight) [135], and thus bring challenges to\
    \ the ﬂight operation. Using UAV, researchers need to consider\nthe UAV SWaP (size,\
    \ weight, and power), geographical coverage, time aloft, altitude, and other variables.\n\
    In addition to the challenges in building a UAV system and performing ﬂight operations,\
    \ researchers\nlikely need to apply for ﬂight permission from an aviation authority\
    \ (e.g., Special Flight Operations\nCertiﬁcate (SFOC) from Transport Canada),\
    \ and purchase suitable UAV ﬂight insurance [136]. UAV size\nand weight are essential\
    \ parameters to consider in these processes. Furthermore, the UAVs are required\n\
    to be visible during ﬂight missions, so that the pilot can maintain constant visual\
    \ contact with the\naircraft. This could create a major challenge when ﬂying over\
    \ a large area, a hilly area, or an area\nwith forests.\n2.4. Close-Range (Ground-\
    \ or Lab-Based) Hyperspectral Imaging\nClose-range hyperspectral imaging, including\
    \ ground (Figure 4a–c) or lab based (Figure 4d,e),\nis an emerging technology\
    \ in recent years, and it is capable of acquiring super-high-spatial-resolution\n\
    (e.g., cm or sub-cm level) hyperspectral imagery [137–139]. Therefore, this imaging\
    \ technology can\nbe used for investigating ﬁne-scale (e.g., leaf and canopy level)\
    \ vegetation features and thus greatly\nsupport the investigation of crop growing\
    \ status and detection of early signs of crop stress (e.g., disease,\nweeds, or\
    \ nutrition deﬁciency). Sensors are mounted on moving or static platforms (e.g.,\
    \ linear\nstages, scaﬀolds, or trucks) that can be deployed indoors or outdoors\
    \ for collecting images. Lamps\n(e.g., halogen lamp) or the sun are used as light\
    \ sources in these platforms, respectively.\nResearchers have utilized diﬀerent\
    \ types of platforms and hyperspectral sensors for collecting\nsuper-high-spatial-resolution\
    \ hyperspectral imagery to study diﬀerent agricultural features, as shown\nin\

    \ for Processing and Analyzing Hyperspectral Images\nHyperspectral images acquired\
    \ by diﬀerent platforms and sensors are typically provided in a\nraw format (e.g.,\
    \ digital numbers) that needs to be pre-processed (e.g., atmospheric, radiometric,\n\
    and spectral corrections) to retrieve accurate spectral information. Afterward,\
    \ diﬀerent approaches can\nbe used for analyzing the hyperspectral information\
    \ and investigating various agricultural features\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    15 of 44\n(e.g., crop and soil properties). A few commonly used methods include\
    \ linear regression, advanced\nregression (e.g., PLSR), machine learning and deep\
    \ learning (e.g., RF, CNN), and radiative transfer\nmodelling (e.g., PROSPECT\
    \ and PROSAIL). Researchers have used one or more of these methods for\ninvestigations\
    \ of diﬀerent agricultural features. In this section, the review is arranged based\
    \ on the\ndiﬀerent methods used in the studies.\n3.1. Pre-Processing of Hyperspectral\
    \ Images\nTypical processing of hyperspectral imagery includes geometric correction,\
    \ orthorectiﬁcation,\nradiometric correction, and atmospheric correction. For\
    \ satellite- and airplane-based hyperspectral\nimages, the geometric and orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ correction are generally performed by data providers,\nand the radiometric and\
    \ atmospheric corrections can be done following standard image processing steps\n\
    available in remote sensing software. For UAV-based images, in contrast, the users\
    \ need to conduct\nthese processing steps and decide on appropriate processing\
    \ methods and associated parameters.\nFor instance, a digital elevation model\
    \ (DEM) and ground control points (GCPs) are usually needed\nfor performing the\
    \ orthorectiﬁcation and geometric correction [12]. If the sensor mounted on UAV\n\
    is pushbroom based, accurate sensor orientation information recorded by an IMU\
    \ will be needed\nfor these corrections, and the IMU needs to be integrated into\
    \ the UAV and well-calibrated [12,27].\nSoftware packages commonly used in previous\
    \ studies for performing these corrections on UAV-based\nhyperspectral images\
    \ include ENVI (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA) and\nPARGE\
    \ (ReSe Applications Schläpfer, Wil, Switzerland) [12,26,117].\nRadiometric correction\
    \ is conducted to convert image digital numbers to radiance using calibration\n\
    coeﬃcients that are provided by the sensor manufacturer [11]. These coeﬃcients\
    \ may need to be updated\nover time due to the degradation of spectral materials\
    \ used to construct the hyperspectral sensors.\nRegarding atmospheric correction,\
    \ although the UAVs are ﬂown at low altitudes, the signals acquired\nare still\
    \ subjective to the inﬂuence of various atmospheric absorptions and scatterings,\
    \ such as oxygen\nabsorption at 760nm; water absorption near 820, 940, 1140, 1380,\
    \ and 1880 nm; and carbon dioxide\nabsorption at 2010 and 2060 nm [12,13,26,150].\
    \ Therefore, atmospheric correction is critical for obtaining\ngood-quality spectral\
    \ information. However, Adão et al. [11] suggest that this process might be skipped\n\
    if the UAVs are operated close to the ground. Therefore, the application of atmospheric\
    \ correction will\ndepend on speciﬁc ﬂight missions and research purposes (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂight altitudes, if atmosphere-inﬂuenced\nspectral bands are needed). Software\
    \ or methods commonly used in previous studies for performing\natmospheric correction\
    \ on UAV-based hyperspectral images include the MODTRAN model (Spectral\nSciences\
    \ Inc.), ENVI FLAASH (L3Harris Geospatial), PCI Geomatica (PCI Geomatics Corporate),\n\
    SMARTS model (Solar Consulting Services), and empirical line correction [12,19,27,32,33,116].\n\
    Hyperspectral images typically have hundreds of bands, and many of them are highly\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, dimension reduction is also an essential procedure to\
    \ consider in the pre-processing of\nhyperspectral imagery. Many previous studies\
    \ using hyperspectral imagery have discussed the\nchallenges of data redundancy\
    \ and have used diﬀerent methods for dimension reduction. For instance,\nMiglani\
    \ et al. [151] performed principal component analysis (PCA) on hyperspectral images\
    \ and\nindicated that 99% of the information could be explained in the ﬁrst 10\
    \ principal components.\nAmato et al. [152] discussed a few previous methods of\
    \ dimension reduction, such as PCA, minimum\nnoise fraction (MNF), and singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD), and proposed a dimension reduction\nalgorithm based\
    \ on discriminant analysis for supervised classiﬁcation. Teke et al. [38] reviewed\n\
    several dimension reduction methods and summarized them based on transformation\
    \ techniques.\nThenkabail et al. [153] discussed the problems of high dimensionality\
    \ and listed a number of spectral\nbands that are more important for investigating\
    \ crop features. Sahoo et al. [4] reviewed diﬀerent\nmethods for dimension reduction,\
    \ such as PCA, uniform feature design (UMD), wavelet transforms,\nand artiﬁcial\
    \ neural networks (ANNs), and discussed their features of operation. Wang et al.\
    \ [154]\nproposed an auto-encoder-based dimensionality reduction method that is\
    \ a deep learning-based\napproach. Of these diﬀerent methods, the wavelet transform\
    \ is one of the most widely used ones for\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n16 of\
    \ 44\ndimension reduction. This technique decomposes a signal into a series of\
    \ scaled versions of the mother\nwavelet function and allows the variation of\
    \ the wavelet based on the frequency information to extract\nlocalized features\
    \ (e.g., local spectral variation) [155,156]. It has also been successfully used\
    \ for image\nfusion, feature extraction, and image classiﬁcation [156–158].\n\
    In addition to dimensionality reduction, band sensitivity analysis and band selection\
    \ have also\nbeen widely used in hyperspectral remote sensing to reduce the data\
    \ size by selecting only the bands\nthat are sensitive to the object of interest.\
    \ Diﬀerent algorithms have been proposed in previous studies\nfor band selection,\
    \ such as a fast volume-gradient-based method that is an unsupervised method and\n\
    removes the most redundant band successively based on the gradient of volume [159],\
    \ a column subset\nselection-based method that maximizes the volume of the selected\
    \ subset of columns (i.e., bands)\nand is robust to noisy bands [160], and a manifold\
    \ ranking-based salient band selection method that\nputs band vectors in manifold\
    \ space and selects a band-based ranking that can tackle the problem of\ninappropriate\
    \ measurement of the band diﬀerence [161]. With the sensitivity analysis, previous\
    \ studies\nhave identiﬁed spectral bands that are sensitive to diﬀerent crop properties,\
    \ for instance, ~515, ~550,\n~570, ~670, 700–740, ~800, and ~855 nm for investigating\
    \ chlorophyll content; ~405, ~515, ~570, ~705,\nand ~720 nm for evaluating nitrogen\
    \ status; ~970, ~1180, ~1245, ~1450, and ~1950 nm for assessing\nwater content;\
    \ ~682, ~855, ~910, ~970, ~1075, ~1245, ~1518, ~1725, and ~2260 nm for estimating\n\
    biomass; and ~550, ~682, ~855, ~1075, ~1180, ~1450, and ~1725 nm for crop classiﬁcation\
    \ [36,44,153,162].\nOverall, pre-processing is an essential step for improving\
    \ the quality of hyperspectral images and\npreparing for further data analysis.\
    \ After the pre-processing, the analytical methods to be discussed\nbelow can\
    \ be used for analyzing the hyperspectral information and investigating various\
    \ agricultural\nfeatures on the ground.\n3.2. Empirical Relationships\nLinear\
    \ regression is a widely used method for analyzing hyperspectral imagery and retrieving\n\
    target information (e.g., crop and soil properties). Both spectral reﬂectance\
    \ and vegetation indices can\nbe used as predictor variables in establishing a\
    \ linear relationship. For instance, using spectral bands,\nFinn et al. [108]\
    \ built linear regressions between ﬁeld-measured soil moisture data and the spectral\n\
    reﬂectance of collected hyperspectral imagery and identiﬁed bands that have stronger\
    \ correlations with\nsoil moisture. More studies have used vegetation indices\
    \ in the regression for a better performance as\nsome indices can enhance the\
    \ signal of targeted features and minimize the background noise. Some of\nthe\
    \ previous studies are shown in Table 6.\nTable 6. Selected previous studies utilized\
    \ linear regression and hyperspectral vegetation indices for\ninvestigating agricultural\

    \ et al. [44]\nUtilized both spectral bands and vegetation indices for\nclassifying\
    \ diﬀerent crop types and estimating vegetation\nproperties and evaluated the\
    \ performance diﬀerence of using\nvarious bands or indices.\nOverall, linear regression\
    \ has been commonly used for estimating a wide range of crop or soil\nproperties.\
    \ It is easy to establish, and most of the index-based regressions generated satisfactory\n\
    accuracies. However, there are several potential issues associated with this approach,\
    \ such as the large\nnumber of indices available and it is unknown which performs\
    \ better, regression may be very sensitive\nto data size and quality, and the\
    \ saturation problem of indices [36,165]. It is thus critical to consider\nthese\
    \ potential issues and adopt appropriate solutions when establishing linear regressions\
    \ with\nhyperspectral data. For instance, selecting appropriate vegetation indices\
    \ with targeted crop or soil\nvariables is recommended. Researchers have evaluated\
    \ a wide range of hyperspectral vegetation indices\nfor diﬀerent research purposes.\
    \ Haboudane et al. [166] examined 11 hyperspectral vegetation indices for\nestimating\
    \ crop chlorophyll content. Main et al. [167] investigated 73 vegetation indices\
    \ for estimating\nchlorophyll content in crop and savanna tree species. Peng and\
    \ Gitelson [168] tested 10 multispectral\nindices and 4 hyperspectral indices\
    \ for quantifying crop gross primary productivity. Croft et al. [169]\nanalyzed\
    \ 47 hyperspectral indices for estimating the leaf chlorophyll content of diﬀerent\
    \ tree species.\nZhou et al. [170] evaluated eight hyperspectral indices for estimating\
    \ the canopy-level wheat nitrogen\ncontent. Tong and He [165] evaluated 21 multispectral\
    \ and 123 hyperspectral vegetation indices for\ncalculating the grass chlorophyll\
    \ content at both the leaf and canopy scales. Yue et al. [171] examined\n54 hyperspectral\
    \ vegetation indices for estimating winter wheat biomass. Indices performed diﬀerently\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n18 of 44\nin these studies; thus, it is suggested\
    \ to evaluate the top-performed ones in these studies and select the\none that\
    \ generates the highest accuracy.\nTo deal with issues of linear regression, advanced\
    \ regression, such as MLR and PLSR, has also\nbeen commonly used in previous research\
    \ for estimating crop and soil properties [172,173]. Compared\nwith linear regression,\
    \ the advanced regression models mostly use multiple predictor variables in the\n\
    model to achieve a higher accuracy. PLSR is one of the most widely used models\
    \ for investigating\ncrop properties using hyperspectral images, such as Ryu et\
    \ al. [35], Jarmer [99], Siegmann et al. [73],\nand Yue et al. [124] used PLSR\
    \ and hyperspectral images for estimating diﬀerent crop biophysical and\nbiochemical\
    \ variables (e.g., LAI, biomass, chlorophyll, content, fresh matter, and nitrogen\
    \ contents).\nThomas et al. [100] examined PLSR for retrieving the biogas potential\
    \ from hyperspectral images and\nevaluated the inﬂuence of imaging time on retrieval\
    \ accuracy. Regarding soil features, Gomez et al. [49],\nVan Wesemael et al. [107],\
    \ Hbirkou et al. [102], and Castaldi et al. [110] built a PLSR model for estimating\n\
    the SOC content using hyperspectral images. Zhang et al. [50] used PLSR for estimating\
    \ a wide range\nof soil properties (e.g., soil moisture, soil organic matter,\
    \ clay, total carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen\ncontent) from hyperspectral imagery\
    \ and identiﬁed factors that may aﬀect the model accuracy\n(e.g., low signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio, spectral overlap of diﬀerent soil features). Casa et al. [59] used the\n\
    PLSR model and diﬀerent hyperspectral imagery for investigating soil textural\
    \ features and evaluated\nvarious factors (e.g., spectral range and resolution,\
    \ soil moisture, geolocation error) inﬂuencing the\nmodel performance.\nThe PLSR\
    \ model is implemented in Python and R [174,175] and is widely used in many research\n\
    areas, including forests [176], grasslands [177], and waters [178]. This model\
    \ performed well in diﬀerent\nstudies owning to its strengths in dealing with\
    \ a large number of inter-correlated predictor variables\n(i.e., by converting\
    \ them to a few non-correlated latent variables), addressing the data noise challenge,\n\
    and tackling the over-ﬁtting problem [171,179]. Diﬀerent techniques have also\
    \ been conﬁrmed to\nbe eﬃcient for improving the accuracy of the PLSR model, such\
    \ as incorporating diﬀerent types of\npredictor variables in the model (e.g.,\
    \ spectral bands, indices, textural variables), utilizing predicted\nresidual\
    \ error sum of squares (PRESS) statistics for determining the optimal number of\
    \ latent variables,\nand feature evaluation for selecting more important predictor\
    \ variables in the model [36]. It is thus\ncritical to carefully examine these\
    \ techniques for achieving the optimal model accuracy.\n3.3. Radiative Transfer\
    \ Modelling\nRadiative transfer modelling is a physically based approach that\
    \ uses physical laws to\nsimulate the interaction of electromagnetic radiation\
    \ with vegetation (e.g., reﬂection, transmission,\nand absorption) [180]. The\
    \ RTMs simulate vegetation spectra (e.g., leaf reﬂectance and transmittance)\n\
    using vegetation biophysical and biochemical properties (e.g., chlorophyll and\
    \ water contents) in\nthe forward mode, and for inversion of these variables from\
    \ spectral measurements in the inverse\nmode [181]. PROSAIL is one of the most\
    \ widely used RTMs. This model is an integration of the\nleaf-level PROSPECT model\
    \ and canopy-level SAIL model and is capable of simulating canopy\nreﬂectance\
    \ using leaf properties (e.g., chlorophyll and water contents), canopy structural\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., LAI and leaf angle), and soil reﬂectance [18].\nPROSAIL has\
    \ also been used in agricultural environments for investigating crop and soil\n\
    properties. For instance, Casa and Jones [182] inverted PROSAIL and a ray-tracing\
    \ canopy model\nwith spectroradiometer-measured hyperspectral reﬂectance data\
    \ and imaging spectrometer-acquired\nhyperspectral image data, respectively, for\
    \ estimating canopy LAI and evaluated factors inﬂuencing\nthe estimation accuracy\
    \ (e.g., the non-homogeneous surface caused by the crop row structure).\nRichter\
    \ et al. [98] utilized PROSAIL for estimating LAI, fCover, canopy chlorophyll,\
    \ and water content\nfrom hyperspectral images and compared its performance to\
    \ other methods (e.g., artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork). Richter et al. [183] applied\
    \ PROSAIL to investigate similar vegetation variables and analyzed\nthe accuracy\
    \ and eﬃciency of this method. Wu et al. [184] examined the sensitivity of vegetation\
    \ indices\nto vegetation chlorophyll content using simulated results from the\
    \ PROSPECT model and suggested\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n19 of 44\na few well-performed\
    \ indices. Locherer et al. [74] attempted to estimate vegetation LAI using the\n\
    PROSAIL model and multi-source hyperspectral images and tested several techniques\
    \ (e.g., diﬀerent\ncost functions and types of averaging methods) used for the\
    \ inversion process. Yu et al. [37] estimated\na range of vegetation phenotyping\
    \ variables (e.g., LAI and leaf chlorophyll) using hyperspectral\nimagery and\
    \ PROSAIL and examined the sensitivity of diﬀerent spectral ranges to the parameters\
    \ in\nthe PROSAIL model.\nCompared with the regression models discussed in previous\
    \ sections, the RTMs have been less\nused in the literature for investigating\
    \ agricultural features due mainly to their high model complexity\nand computational\
    \ intensity. For instance, a wide range of parameters need to be considered in\n\
    RTM (e.g., chlorophyll, carotenoids, water contents, leaf area index, leaf angles,\
    \ solar angles, and soil\nreﬂectance, along with other parameters, in the PROSAIL\
    \ model) and the users need to use diﬀerent\ntechniques (e.g., merit function,\
    \ look-up table) to facilitate the forward and inversion operations of\nthe model.\
    \ In addition, it costs much more computing time than the regression models to\
    \ achieve the\npredictions of target vegetation variables. However, it is also\
    \ well known that the regression models\ntend to be site and time speciﬁc and\
    \ are not readily transferable to other geographical regions or\ndiﬀerent times\
    \ over the site [166]. In contrast, RTM is a more transferable approach owning\
    \ to the\nfact that it is established based on physical laws and does not require\
    \ training data for rebuilding\nthe model. In addition, RTM is capable of estimating\
    \ a range of vegetation properties in one model,\nwhile regression models typically\
    \ can only estimate one variable [36,185].\n3.4. Machine Learning and Deep Learning\n\
    Machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine regression (SVM)\
    \ and RF,\nare powerful tools for analyzing hyperspectral information since they\
    \ can process a large number of\nvariables (e.g., spectral reﬂectance and vegetation\
    \ indices) eﬃciently [186]. Machine learning has been\nwidely used in the remote\
    \ sensing ﬁeld for estimating properties of ground features or classifying\ndiﬀerent\
    \ ground covers [36,114,187]. Researchers have also used diﬀerent machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nand hyperspectral images for agricultural applications. SVM has\
    \ been a commonly used algorithm\nin previous research for prediction or classiﬁcation\
    \ purposes. For instance, Honkavaara et al. [123]\nestimated crop biomass using\
    \ SVM and UAV-acquired hyperspectral imagery. Bostan et al. [51] utilized\nSVM\
    \ for classifying diﬀerent crop types and achieved high classiﬁcation accuracy.\
    \ Ran et al. [93]\nused KNN and SVM classiﬁers for investigating tillage practices\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds and compared\ntheir performances. RF is another commonly\
    \ used algorithm for investigating agricultural features\nwith hyperspectral imagery.\
    \ For instance, Gao et al. [188] successfully classiﬁed weed and maize\nusing\
    \ RF and lab-based hyperspectral images. Using ground-based hyperspectral reﬂectance\
    \ data\nacquired by an ASD spectroradiometer, Siegmann and Jarmer [189] evaluated\
    \ the performance of\nRF, SVM, and PLSR for estimating crop LAI and conﬁrmed the\
    \ good performance of RF. Similarly,\nusing hyperspectral reﬂectance, Adam et\
    \ al. [190] attempted to detect maize disease with the RF model.\nOverall, machine\
    \ learning models generally have robust performances for investigating agricultural\n\
    features using hyperspectral imagery.\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning\
    \ and extends machine learning by adding more\n“depth” (i.e., hierarchical representation\
    \ of the dataset) in the model [191,192]. It is a popular approach\nin recent\
    \ years for recognizing patterns in remote sensing images and thus for investigating\
    \ various\nground features. Deep learning has been commonly used in the remote\
    \ sensing ﬁeld for image\nclassiﬁcation, such as land cover classiﬁcation [193–195]\
    \ and the identiﬁcation of ground features\n(e.g., buildings) [196]. Deep learning\
    \ has also been applied to precision farming to solve complicated\nissues. Existing\
    \ studies are, for example, investigating the estimation of crop yield using CNN\n\
    and multispectral images together with climate data [197], plant disease detection\
    \ using CNN and\nsmartphone-acquired images [198], crop classiﬁcation using 3-D\
    \ CNN and multi-temporal multispectral\nimages [199], and classiﬁcation of agricultural\
    \ land cover using deep recurrent neural network and\nmulti-temporal SAR images\
    \ [200]. Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú [191] reviewed applications of deep\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n20 of 44\nlearning in agriculture and food production,\
    \ although not all studies used remote sensing images.\nSingh et al. [201] reviewed\
    \ a range of deep learning methods and their applications, speciﬁcally in plant\n\
    phenotyping. Up to now, deep learning has not been well explored for processing\
    \ and analyzing remote\nsensing images, especially hyperspectral images, for agricultural\
    \ applications. Considering the capacity\nof deep learning for studying feature\
    \ patterns in images and the rich information in hyperspectral\nimagery, the integration\
    \ of the two has a wide range of agricultural applications (e.g., crop classiﬁcation,\n\
    weed monitoring, crop disease detection, and plant stress evaluation). Further\
    \ research in these areas\nis warranted.\nMachine learning or deep learning is\
    \ capable of processing multi-source and multi-type data [202].\nFor instance,\
    \ besides multi-type remote sensing images (e.g., optical, thermal, LiDAR, and\
    \ Radar), other\nsources of data, such as weather, irrigation, and historical\
    \ yield information, can also be incorporated in\nthe modelling process for a\
    \ possibly better evaluation of targeted agricultural features [203]. Although\n\
    machine learning and deep learning models are powerful, it is also critical to\
    \ keep in mind that these\nmodels require large-quantity and high-quality training\
    \ samples to achieve robust performances [202].\nInsuﬃcient training datasets\
    \ or data with issues (e.g., data incompleteness, noise, and biases) may\ncause\
    \ undesired model performances.\nIn summary, diﬀerent analytical methods (e.g.,\
    \ linear regression, advanced regression,\nmachine learning and deep learning,\
    \ and RTM) have diﬀerent levels of complexity, performance,\nand transferability.\
    \ More detailed comparisons on these methods are listed in Table 7. Overall, linear\n\
    regression is the easiest method to use, and its performance is generally acceptable,\
    \ although this\nmethod can be highly inﬂuenced by the choice of predictor variables\
    \ and quality of the sample data.\nThe advanced regression (e.g., PLSR) mostly\
    \ performs better than the linear regression since it involves\nmultiple variables\
    \ in the model and is less sensitive to data noise. RTM (e.g., PROSAIL) is capable\
    \ of\nproducing multiple data products (e.g., chlorophyll, water, and LAI) with\
    \ reasonably high accuracies.\nOne essential advantage of this method is its high\
    \ transferability. However, this method has the highest\ncomplexity as it requires\
    \ a wide range of parameters and extensive programming. In terms of machine\n\
    learning, many algorithms, such as RF and SVM, are well established and mostly\
    \ performed well in\nprevious studies. Some programming and model adjustments\
    \ are needed for this method to achieve\noptimal performance. Deep learning is\
    \ a relatively new method and is increasingly popular in recent\nyears. Appropriate\
    \ model design and programming are critical for this approach. It also requires\
    \ a\nsubstantial amount of training data and computing resources to achieve a\
    \ good model performance.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n21 of 44\nTable 7. Comparison\

    \ imaging has been used in agriculture for a wide range of purposes, including\n\
    estimating crop biochemical properties (e.g., chlorophyll, carotenoids, and water\
    \ contents) and\nbiophysical properties (e.g., LAI, biomass) for understanding\
    \ vegetation physiological status and\npredicting yield, evaluating crop nutrient\
    \ status (e.g., nitrogen deﬁciency), monitoring crop disease,\nand investigating\
    \ soil properties (e.g., soil moisture, soil organic matter, and soil carbon).\
    \ Previous\nstudies have also summarized some of the above-mentioned applications\
    \ of hyperspectral remote\nsensing in precision agriculture [4,84]. In this section,\
    \ we will thus focus more on recent hyperspectral\nstudies and summarize these\
    \ studies according to speciﬁc applications.\n4.1. Estimation of Crop Biochemical\
    \ and Biophysical Properties\nOne important hyperspectral application in agriculture\
    \ is monitoring crop conditions through\nthe retrieval of crop biochemical and\
    \ biophysical properties [8,99]. For instance, the leaf chlorophyll\ncontent is\
    \ an essential biochemical property inﬂuencing the vegetation photosynthetic capacity\
    \ and\ncontrolling crop productivity [99]. In previous studies, Oppelt and Mauser\
    \ [105] collected AVIS data\nto retrieve the chlorophyll and nitrogen contents\
    \ in a winter wheat ﬁeld. Similarly, Moharana and\nDutta [43] used Hyperion data\
    \ to estimate the contents of these two biochemical components in a rice\nﬁeld.\
    \ LAI, on the other hand, is a fundamental vegetation biophysical parameter and\
    \ is highly related\nto crop biomass and yield [98]. Previous studies have used\
    \ hyperspectral remote sensing to estimate\nthe LAI of diﬀerent crops, and some\
    \ of the example studies are shown in Table 8.\nTable 8. Selected previous studies\
    \ estimating LAI for diﬀerent crop types using hyperspectral images.\nCrops\n\
    Previous Studies\nResearch Focuses\nWinter wheat\nXie et al. [109]\nEstimated\
    \ canopy LAI in a winter wheat ﬁeld using airborne\nhyperspectral imagery and\
    \ proposed a new vegetation index for\nimproved estimation accuracy.\nSiegmann\
    \ et al. [73]\nRetrieved LAI of two wheat ﬁelds using EnMAP images and\nattempted\
    \ to pan-sharp the images aiming to improve the\nspatial resolution of LAI products.\n\
    Barley\nJarmer [99]\nRetrieved a range of canopy variables from barley, including\n\
    LAI, chlorophyll, water, and fresh matter content using HyMap\ndata and established\
    \ an eﬃcient approach for monitoring the\nspatial patterns of crop variables.\n\
    Rice\nYu et al. [37]\nInvestigated LAI, leaf chlorophyll content, canopy water\n\
    content, and dry matter content using UAV-based hyperspectral\nimagery, aiming\
    \ to understand the growing status of rice.\nMixed\nagricultural\nﬁelds\nRichter\
    \ et al. [98]\nEstimated crop LAI and water content with airborne HyMap\ndata\
    \ aiming to support operational agricultural practices (e.g.,\nirrigation management\
    \ and crop stress detection) in the context\nof the EnMap hyperspectral mission.\n\
    Wu et al. [45]\nEstimated chlorophyll content and LAI in a mixed agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld (e.g., corns, chestnuts trees, and tea plants) using Hyperion\ndata and identiﬁed\
    \ spectral bands and vegetation indices that\ngenerated the highest accuracy.\n\
    Verger et al. [57]\nEstimated LAI, fCover, and FAPAR in an agricultural site with\n\
    diﬀerent crops using PROBA-CHRIS data.\nLocherer et al. [74]\nEstimated LAI in\
    \ mixed crop ﬁelds using EnMAP data and\ncompared the result accuracy to that\
    \ of LAI estimation with\nairborne data.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n23 of 44\n\
    In addition to the above-mentioned vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties,\
    \ crop water\ncontent is a critical parameter for revealing water stress. Richter\
    \ et al. [98] attempted to estimate the\nwater content in maize, sugar beet, and\
    \ winter wheat using airborne HyMap data. Moharana and\nDutta [204] investigated\
    \ the water stress in a rice ﬁeld and its variations using Hyperion images and\n\
    indicated that the remote sensing-estimated water content matched well with ﬁeld-observed\
    \ data.\nIzzo et al. [128] evaluated the water status in a commercial vineyard\
    \ using UAV-based hyperspectral\ndata and determined wavelengths sensitive to\
    \ the canopy water content. Sahoo et al. [4] discussed the\napplications of hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing data for evaluating water features in crops and listed\nseveral\
    \ vegetation indices for calculating the water content.\nIt can be found from\
    \ the literature review that many previous studies have focused on estimating\n\
    the crop chlorophyll content, LAI, and water content using hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ while other\nimportant crop properties, such as carotenoids, that are sensitive\
    \ to plant stress are less explored.\nIn addition, crop production is inﬂuenced\
    \ by all of these vegetation properties (e.g., chlorophyll,\nwater, and LAI).\
    \ Besides investigating the spatial and temporal variations of each property,\
    \ it is also\ncritical to evaluate the relationships between these properties\
    \ and further understand how they aﬀect\ncrop growth and crop production.\nEstimating\
    \ crop biomass and forecasting yield are also important applications of remote\
    \ sensing,\nas they will contribute to the understanding of crop productivity\
    \ and implementing suitable\nmanagement measures [126]. Yue et al. [124] utilized\
    \ UAV-based hyperspectral images for estimating the\nabove-ground biomass of winter\
    \ wheat. Yang [205] and Mariotto et al. [15] utilized both multispectral\nand\
    \ hyperspectral data to estimate crop yield and found that the hyperspectral imagery-based\
    \ model\nperformed better. In addition, crop residues left in the ﬁeld are critical\
    \ materials protecting soil\nfrom water and wind erosion and inﬂuencing soil biochemical\
    \ processes. Previous studies, such as\nBannari et al. [106], Galloza and Crawford\
    \ [47], Bannari et al. [46], have used diﬀerent hyperspectral\nimages for the\
    \ estimation of crop residues on farmlands\nBeyond the estimation of crop biomass\
    \ and residue, one further research topic is investigating\nbioenergy (e.g., biogas),\
    \ which can be generated from the crop biomass. Thomas et al. [100] attempted\n\
    to estimate the amount of biogas that can be generated per unit of biomass using\
    \ airborne HyMap\ndata and achieved satisfactory results. Overall, hyperspectral\
    \ imagery has contributed greatly to the\nestimation of crop biomass, yield, and\
    \ other related features (e.g., bioenergy, crop residues). Since crop\nbiomass\
    \ and yield are highly aﬀected by agricultural practices (e.g., watering and nutrition\
    \ treatment),\ninvolving these practice data, together with hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ in the model can potentially\ngenerate better results. More research in this\
    \ area is warranted.\n4.2. Evaluating Crop Nutrient Status\nPrecision farming\
    \ involves evaluating the crop nutrient status and providing recommendations\n\
    on site-speciﬁc resource management according to crop needs [206]. Such an approach\
    \ is critical for\nimproving the resource use eﬃciency and reducing environmental\
    \ impacts [4,103]. Previous studies\nhave used hyperspectral images for estimating\
    \ the nitrogen content of diﬀerent crop types, as shown\nin Table 9.\nTable 9.\
    \ Selected previous studies estimating the nitrogen content for diﬀerent crop\
    \ types using\nhyperspectral images.\nCrop types\nPrevious Studies\nResearch Focuses\n\
    Corn\nAkhtman et al. [127]\nUsed UAV-based hyperspectral images for estimating\
    \ nitrogen\ncontent and phytomass in corn and wheat ﬁelds and monitored the\n\
    temporal variation of these properties.\nGoel et al. [207]\nCollected hyperspectral\
    \ images in a cornﬁeld with diﬀerent nitrogen\ntreatments and weed controls aiming\
    \ to evaluate to what extent the\nspectral signals can identify diﬀerent nitrogen\
    \ treatments, weed\ncontrols, or their interactions.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\

    \ a way to evaluate the minimum\namount of nitrogen to apply without reducing\
    \ crop yield and avoid\nexcessive fertilization.\nQuemada et al. [208]\nEvaluated\

    Attempted to investigate wheat nitrogen status and aboveground\nbiomass using\
    \ hyperspectral and radar images and to evaluate\nspectral signatures of wheats\
    \ under diﬀerent nitrogen treatments.\nKaivosoja et al. [126]\nUsed UAV-based\
    \ hyperspectral imagery to investigate nitrogen\ncontent and absolute biomass\
    \ in a wheat ﬁeld and evaluated the\ndegree of nitrogen shortage on the date of\
    \ image acquisition. In this\nresearch, historical farming data, including a yield\
    \ map and a spring\nfertilization map, were used for estimating the optimal amount\
    \ of\nfertilizer to be applied in diﬀerent areas of the ﬁeld.\nCastaldi et al.\
    \ [210]\nEstimated nitrogen content in wheat using multi-temporal\nsatellite-based\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral images and found\nthat the band selection aﬀected\
    \ estimation accuracy at diﬀerent\nphenological stages.\nRice\nMoharana and Dutta\
    \ [43]\nCollected Hyperion images for monitoring nitrogen and chlorophyll\ncontents\
    \ in rice and investigated the performance of diﬀerent\nspectral indices.\nRyu\
    \ et al. [35]\nUsed airborne hyperspectral images and multivariable analysis to\n\
    estimate nitrogen content in rice at the heading stage.\nZheng et al. [211]\n\
    Tried to monitor rice nitrogen status using UAV-based hyperspectral\nimages and\
    \ tested the performance of diﬀerent vegetation indices\nfor estimating the nitrogen\
    \ content.\nZhou et al. [212]\nEstimated leaf nitrogen concentration of rice using\
    \ close-range\nhyperspectral images and tested if the variations of the spatial\n\
    resolution of the imagery aﬀect the estimation accuracy.\nOther crops\n(i.e.,\
    \ barley,\npotato,\ncabbage,\ntomato,\nsugarcane,\nand cacao)\nNasi et al. [213]\n\
    Evaluated the performance of using airborne hyperspectral images\nand photogrammetric\
    \ features for estimating crop nitrogen content\nand biomass in a barley ﬁeld\
    \ and a grassland site, and examined if\nthe integration of spectral and plant\
    \ height information can improve\nthe estimation results.\nNigon et al. [214]\n\
    Examined nitrogen stress in potato ﬁelds using airborne\nhyperspectral imagery\
    \ and identiﬁed spectral indices that are\nsensitive to nitrogen content.\nChen\
    \ et al. [215]\nEstimated nitrogen content in cabbage seedlings using close-range\n\
    hyperspectral images and identiﬁed sensitive wavelengths for the\nestimation.\n\
    Zhu et al. [142]\nInvestigated soluble sugar, total nitrogen, and their ratio\
    \ in tomato\nleaves using close-range hyperspectral images and tested data\nfusion\
    \ analysis techniques for improving the investigation accuracy.\nMiphokasap and\n\
    Wannasiri [216]\nCollected Hyperion images for investigating spatial variations\
    \ of\nsugarcane canopy nitrogen concentration and attempted to identify\nthe nutrient\
    \ deﬁcient areas for corresponding treatments.\nMalmir et al. [217]\nAttempted\
    \ to evaluate nutrient status (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus,\nand potassium) of\
    \ cacao leaves using close-range hyperspectral\nimages and examined inﬂuences\
    \ of band selection on the evaluation\naccuracy.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    25 of 44\nOverall, owing to the large amount of spectral information in hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, crop nutrient\nstatus can be evaluated with high accuracies, and a\
    \ corresponding fertilizer treatment plan can be\nproposed to achieve optimal\
    \ crop productions. However, it is also essential to keep in mind that there is\n\
    a wide range of factors, such as soil moisture, soil type, and topographic conditions,\
    \ that can impact crop\ngrowth and production. A more comprehensive treatment\
    \ plan that takes into consideration both the\ncrop nutrient status and other\
    \ inﬂuencing factors can make a greater contribution to crop production.\n4.3.\
    \ Classifying Imagery to Identify Crop Types, Growing Stages, Weeds/Invasive Species,\
    \ and Stress/Disease\nBesides quantifying crop properties, hyperspectral images\
    \ have also been used for classiﬁcation\npurposes, such as differentiating crop\
    \ types, identifying crop growing stages, classifying weeds or invasive\nspecies,\
    \ and detecting disease [218]. Examples of previous studies are shown in Table\
    \ 10. Diﬀerent\nagricultural land covers or crop types have diﬀerent spectral\
    \ characteristics; hence, hyperspectral\nimages can contribute greatly to the\
    \ classiﬁcation of these agricultural features.\nTable 10. Selected previous studies\

    Camacho Velasco et al. [48]\nUtilized Hyperion data and diﬀerent classiﬁcation\

    \ citrus, and sugar cane) in Colombia.\nBostan et al. [51]\nClassiﬁed diﬀerent\
    \ crop and land cover types (e.g., maize,\ncotton, urban, water, barren rock,\

    \ to growers trying to reduce economic and yield\nlosses [38]. Hyperspectral imaging\
    \ collects signals at fine spectral resolutions (e.g., less than 10-nm\nintervals),\
    \ and thus can possibly detect early symptoms of crop disease and support timely\n\
    interventions [225].\nPrevious studies have used hyperspectral images for detecting\
    \ diseases in\ndiﬀerent types of groups (Table 12). Overall, hyperspectral signals\
    \ are sensitive to the variations of\ncrop growth status (e.g., caused by disease\
    \ or stress) and thus can indicate the occurrence of crop\ndisease or stress.\
    \ However, considering that crop status can be aﬀected by other factors (e.g.,\
    \ nutrient\ndeﬁciency), repeat imaging and analysis together with robust modelling\
    \ would be critical for accurate\nand timely detection of crop disease or stress.\n\

    \ Moisture, Fertility, and Other Physical or Chemical Properties\nAgricultural\
    \ soil properties, including soil moisture, soil organic matter, soil salinity,\
    \ and roughness,\nare important factors inﬂuencing crop growth and ﬁnal production\
    \ [7]. Hyperspectral remote sensing\ncan contribute greatly to the investigation\
    \ of these factors. For instance, estimating soil moisture is\none of the most\
    \ popular research topics. Finn et al. [108] estimated soil moisture at three\
    \ diﬀerent\ndepths using airborne hyperspectral images and linear regression and\
    \ discussed the contributions and\nlimitations of hyperspectral remote sensing\
    \ for soil moisture studies. Casa et al. [229] investigated\nsoil water, clay,\
    \ and sand contents using a fusion of CHRIS-PROBA images and soil geophysical\
    \ data.\nShoshany et al. [7] summarized four main approaches for estimating soil\
    \ moisture content: (1) Radar\ntechniques; (2) radiation balance and surface temperature\
    \ calculations; (3) reﬂectance in the visible,\nNIR, and SWIR ranges; and (4)\
    \ integrative methods using multiple spectral ranges. Although soil\nmoisture\
    \ can be estimated using optical remote sensing data, it is often aﬀected by the\
    \ plant ground\ncover. Integrating multi-type remote sensing data, e.g., SAR and\
    \ thermal data, can possibly generate\nmore accurate estimates.\nSOC is a critical\
    \ component of soil fertility, which highly controls both the growth and yield\
    \ of\ncrops. Hyperspectral data provide ﬁne spectral details that are critical\
    \ for the estimation of SOC content.\nPrevious studies have used hyperspectral\
    \ images collected by diﬀerent platforms for investigating\nSOC (Table 13). Overall,\
    \ hyperspectral imagery has a high potential for the estimation of soil organic\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n28 of 44\nmatter and carbon. However, similar to\
    \ the evaluation of soil moisture, the investigation of soil organic\nmatter and\
    \ carbon can be highly inﬂuenced by vegetation cover. Therefore, collecting hyperspectral\n\
    images in non-growing seasons could be a solution.\nTable 13. Selected previous\
    \ studies for estimating soil organic carbon using hyperspectral images\nacquired\
    \ by diﬀerent platforms.\nPlatforms\nPrevious Studies\nResearch Focuses\nSatellites\n\
    Zhang et al. [50]\nUtilized EO-1 Hyperion images for estimating several soil\n\
    properties, including soil moisture, soil organic matter, total\ncarbon, total\
    \ phosphorus, total nitrogen, and clay content. The\nauthors also found the inﬂuence\
    \ of spectral resolution on the\nperformance of retrieval models.\nCasa et al.\
    \ [230]\nAssessed soil organic matter and soil texture at the ﬁeld scale\nusing\
    \ CHRIS-PROBA images and produced uniform soil zones\nfor supporting irrigation\
    \ management.\nAirplanes\nHbirkou et al. [102]\nAttempted to estimate SOC in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds using airborne\nHyMap images and tested the inﬂuences of soil surface\n\
    conditions on the estimation, aiming to support soil\nmanagement in precision\
    \ farming.\nGedminas and Martin [231]\nTried to map soil organic matter using\
    \ airborne hyperspectral\nimagery in combination with topographic information\
    \ extracted\nfrom LiDAR image and evaluated the correlation between soil\norganic\
    \ matter and various spectral bands.\nCastaldi et al. [110]\nInvestigated the\
    \ relationship between SOC in croplands and\nspectral signals using a soil database\
    \ and then estimated SOC in\ntheir study sites using airborne hyperspectral imagery.\
    \ With this\napproach, the authors attempted to reduce the amount of new\ndata\
    \ collection in the ﬁeld or lab.\nVan Wesemael et al. [107]\nDiscussed the impacts\
    \ of vegetation cover on soil and the\nestimation of SOC from remote sensing data\
    \ and attempted to\nuse spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the fraction\
    \ of\nvegetation cover and then estimate the soil carbon content using\nthe residue\
    \ soil spectra.\nMultiple\nplatforms\nGomez et al. [49]\nEstimated SOC using both\
    \ lab-based hyperspectral reﬂectance\ndata and Hyperion image data and found that\
    \ using the\nlab-acquired reﬂectance data can generate more accurate results\n\
    than using the Hyperion data. At the same time, the Hyperion\ndata can generate\
    \ a SOC map that matches ﬁeld observations\nand thus can also be used for prediction.\n\
    Hyperspectral remote sensing data have also been used for estimating other soil\
    \ features, as shown\nin Table 14. It can be found from these studies that hyperspectral\
    \ images can be used for studying a\nwide range of soil features. Diﬀerent soil\
    \ features inﬂuence the spectral signals in diﬀerent bands and\nwith diﬀerent\
    \ magnitudes, while some of these inﬂuences may be spectrally overlapped. Therefore,\n\
    when investigating a speciﬁc soil feature, it is critical to collect a suitable\
    \ number of soil samples with\nother soil features generally controlled.\nRemote\

    \ has great potential for applications in agriculture, particularly precision\n\
    agriculture, owing to ample spectral information sensitive to diﬀerent plant and\
    \ soil biophysical and\nbiochemical properties. Multiple platforms, including\
    \ satellites, airplanes, UAVs, and close-range\nplatforms, have become more widely\
    \ available in recent years for collecting hyperspectral images with\ndiﬀerent\
    \ spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. These platforms also have diﬀerent\
    \ strengths and\nlimitations in terms of spatial coverage, ﬂight endurance, ﬂexibility,\
    \ operational complexity, and cost.\nThese factors need to be considered when\
    \ choosing imaging platform(s) for speciﬁc research purposes.\nFurther technological\
    \ developments are also needed to overcome some of the limitations, such as the\n\
    short battery endurance in UAV operations and high cost of hyperspectral sensors.\n\
    Diﬀerent analytical methods, such as linear regression, advanced regression, machine\
    \ learning,\ndeep learning, and RTM, have been explored in previous studies for\
    \ analyzing the tremendous amount\nof information in hyperspectral images for\
    \ investigating diﬀerent agricultural features. Previous\nstudies have mainly\
    \ used the regression approach, while more physically based methods, such as\n\
    RTM, have been less explored. Deep learning and eﬀective big-data analytics are\
    \ powerful tools for\nrecognizing patterns in remote sensing data. Together with\
    \ hyperspectral imagery, deep learning\nmodels have high potential to support\
    \ the monitoring of a wide range of agricultural features. Diﬀerent\nanalytical\
    \ methods have diﬀerent advantages and disadvantages, and thus it is critical\
    \ to compare\nthese methods for speciﬁc research (e.g., requirements of accuracy\
    \ and computing eﬃciency) and\nchoose an optimal approach. In addition, image\
    \ spectral information has been commonly used as\nvariables for prediction or\
    \ classiﬁcation tasks, while other information, such as texture, has been less\n\
    explored. Further, some other sources of data, such as weather, irrigation records,\
    \ and historical yield\ninformation, can also be used in some of the analytical\
    \ methods (e.g., machine learning and deep\nlearning) for better monitoring of\
    \ crop features. More research in these ﬁelds is also warranted.\nHyperspectral\
    \ imaging has been successfully applied in a wide range of agricultural applications,\n\
    including estimating crop biochemical and biophysical properties; evaluating crop\
    \ nutrient and stress\nstatus; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds, and\
    \ diseases; and investigating soil characteristics.\nPrevious studies have focused\
    \ on discussing one or two of the many factors impacting crop growth\nperformance\
    \ and productivity, and thus cannot evaluate crop status and growth-limiting factors\n\
    comprehensively. It is important to integrate these factors to achieve a better\
    \ understanding of their\ninter-relationships for optimal crop production and\
    \ environmental protection. Besides, previous studies\nusing hyperspectral imaging\
    \ have mainly targeted investigating crop growth, aiming to improve\ncrop yield,\
    \ while less research has focused on understanding the ecosystem side of crop\
    \ production\n(e.g., ecosystem services and biodiversity). Further research in\
    \ these areas is warranted.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S., J.L.,\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: A rise in the population has immensely increased the
    pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    The recently developed OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has been successfully

    applied for watershed scale soil moisture (SM) estimation based on remotely sensed

    shortwave infrared (SWIR) transformed reﬂectance (TRSWIR) and the normalized

    difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study is aimed at the evaluation of OPTRAM

    for ﬁeld scale precision agriculture applications using ultrahigh spatial resolution
    optical

    observations obtained with one of the world’s largest ﬁeld robotic phenotyping
    scanners

    located in Maricopa, Arizona. We replaced NDVI with the soil adjusted vegetation
    index

    (SAVI), which has been shown to be more accurate for cropped agricultural ﬁelds
    that

    transition from bare soil to dense vegetation cover. The OPTRAM was parameterized

    based on the trapezoidal geometry of the pixel distribution within the TRSWIR-SAVI

    space, from which wet- and dry-edge parameters were determined. The accuracy of

    the resultant SM estimates is evaluated based on a comparison with ground reference

    measurements obtained with Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors deployed to

    monitor surface, near-surface and root zone SM. The obtained results indicate
    an SM

    estimation error between 0.045 and 0.057 cm3 cm−3 for the near-surface and root
    zone,

    respectively. The high resolution SM maps clearly capture the spatial SM variability
    at

    the sensor locations. These ﬁndings and the presented framework can be applied
    in

    conjunction with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) observations to assist with farm
    scale

    precision irrigation management to improve water use efﬁciency of cropping systems
    and

    conserve water in water-limited regions of the world.

    INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

    Soil moisture is a key hydrologic state variable that links land surface and atmospheric
    processes

    (Babaeian et al., 2019). Detailed knowledge about the state of SM and its spatial
    and temporal

    dynamics is of crucial importance for crop production to avoid water stress, but
    also for the

    mitigation of adverse environmental impacts due to over-irrigation as well as
    for the conservation

    Babaeian et al.

    Optical Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture

    of water resources, which is a pressing issue in water-limited

    regions of the world (Tuller et al., 2019). For example, the

    water scarcity projections are dire for much of the rapidly

    growing southwestern United States, for which the Colorado

    River is the major water source for over 36 million people

    and for close to 6 million acres of irrigated farmland (Owen,

    2017). This escalating water crises demands development

    and adoption of transformative technologies for precision

    irrigation management.

    Today, airborne remote sensing (RS) techniques with

    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide an exceedingly

    powerful means for high temporal and spatial resolution SM

    observations (Stark et al., 2015). However, most of the currently

    employed RS techniques for SM estimation have been developed

    and evaluated for coarse-resolution (several tens of kilometers)

    satellite observations in the optical (Sadeghi et al., 2017),

    thermal (Shaﬁan and Maas, 2015), and microwave (Kerr et al.,

    2001; Entekhabi et al., 2010) electromagnetic domains. Despite

    signiﬁcant advances in large-scale SM estimation, for example,

    methods based on microwave observations (e.g., SMAP, SMOS)

    have limited applicability at smaller scales such as cropped ﬁelds,

    which renders them unsuitable for farm-level precision irrigation

    management. This advocates the need for the development and

    implementation of high-resolution RS techniques amenable for

    ﬁeld scale SM monitoring and mapping.

    Sadeghi et al. (2017) proposed the physically-based OPtical

    TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) for estimation of spatiotemporal

    surface soil moisture dynamics based on the pixel distribution

    within the Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI)

    and shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance (TRSWIR) space.

    More speciﬁcally, the OPTRAM estimates surface soil moisture

    based on the physical relationship between TRSWIR and the

    vegetation cover (Eﬀati et al., 2019). The OPTRAM has been

    successfully validated with satellite data (i.e., Sentinel-2, Landsat-

    8, and MODIS) for several watersheds in the U.S. with vastly

    diﬀerent climatic conditions, surface topologies, and vegetation

    covers via comparison of the model’s surface soil moisture

    estimates with ground reference measurements (Sadeghi et al.,

    2017; Babaeian et al., 2018). Mananze et al. (2019) applied the

    OPTRAM for agricultural drought monitoring in Mozambique.

    The advantages of the OPTRAM are twofold—it does not require

    thermal data such as traditional triangle or trapezoid models, and

    it can be universally parameterized for a given location because

    the TRSWIR-soil moisture relationship is not aﬀected by ambient

    environmental factors (e.g., air temperature and wind speed).

    Motivated by the successful application of the OPTRAM

    at the watershed scale, we hypothesize that the model is

    also applicable to high spatial resolution visible near infrared

    (Vis-NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) observations as the

    boundaries of the optical trapezoid are expected to be more

    distinct for the rather homogeneous surface conditions of

    agricultural ﬁelds when compared to the heterogeneous land

    surfaces of watersheds. Here, we test this hypothesis with

    ultrahigh spatial resolution Vis-NIR, and SWIR observations

    obtained with the TERRAPHENOTYPING–REFERENCE (TERRA-

    REF) platform, one of the world’s largest ﬁeld phenotyping robots

    located in Maricopa (AZ), and postulate that if the OPTRAM

    FIGURE 1 | Conceptual sketch of the TRSWIR-SAVI feature space.

    is applicable for SM mapping with ultrahigh spatial resolution

    optical reﬂectance data, it is also amenable for parametrization

    with high-resolution data captured with UAS’s, and thus can be

    applied for farm scale precision irrigation management.

    METHODOLOGY

    Optical Trapezoid Model

    The volumetric SM content (cm3 cm−3) is obtained from

    the trapezoidal geometry of the transformed SWIR reﬂectance

    (TRSWIR)—vegetation index feature space (Sadeghi et al., 2017)

    as conceptually shown in Figure 1. For this study, we replaced

    the previously applied NDVI with the SAVI because it is generally

    more sensitive to sparse vegetation cover (i.e., the initial and

    development stages of agricultural crops) as it corrects for the

    inﬂuence of soil brightness when vegetation density is low. This

    leads to independence of the OPTRAM parameters from soil

    type. The volumetric SM is calculated as:

    SM =

    idry + sdrySAVI − TRSWIR

    idry − iwet + (sdry − swet)SAVI × n

    (1)

    with

    SAVI =

    RNIR − RRe d

    RNIR + RRe d + L × (1 + L)

    (2)

    and

    TRSWIR = (1 − RSWIR)2

    2RSWIR

    (3)

    Where i and s are the intercept and slope of the dry- and wet-

    edge, respectively (Figure 1), n is the soil porosity, L is the

    soil brightness correction factor, and RRed, RNIR, and RSWIR

    denote the reﬂectances within the Red (636–673 nm), NIR (760–

    823 nm), and SWIR (2,110–2,290 nm) spectral bands captured

    and for bare soil L = 1. Generally, L = 0.5 is applied as the default

    value. When L = 0, then the SAVI equals the NDVI.

    were acquired at ultrahigh spatial resolution with the TERRA-

    REF platform (Figure 2a). This state-of-the-art instrument

    located in Maricopa, Arizona consists of a 30-ton steel gantry

    with suspended instrument box that contains various imaging

    systems and sensors, including hyperspectral Vis-NIR and SWIR

    cameras (Figure 2b) with their speciﬁcations listed in Table 1.

    The robot autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails

    and continuously images the soil and crop below, providing

    reﬂectance measurements while the land surface transitions from

    bare soil to full plant canopy (Burnette et al., 2018).

    The hyperspectral imagers (Headwall Photonics, Bolton, MA,

    USA) are push-broom sensors that acquire 939 (Vis-NIR)

    and 275 (SWIR) spectral bands within the 380–1,000 nm and

    900–2,500 nm electromagnetic frequency ranges, respectively

    (Figure 2c). The distance between the soil surface and the

    hyperspectral cameras was 2-m. The Vis-NIR hyperspectral

    images for calculation of the SAVI were radiometrically

    calibrated using real-time down-welling irradiance captured with

    a spectral irradiance meter (Ocean Optics, Largo, FL, USA)

    mounted on top of the gantry, which covers the range from

    337 to 823 nm. The SWIR images were calibrated with white

    and gray reference panels with known spectral reﬂectance values

    placed at the 2-m distance below the imaging system (Figure 3).

    Prior to irradiance-based calibration, the dark current was

    subtracted from the raw image to correct for detector artifacts.

    Hyperspectral bands over each domain were averaged and used

    for analysis.

    The OPTRAM-estimated SM values were then evaluated

    TDR-315, Acclima, Inc., Meridian, ID, USA) installed at three

    locations within the scanner ﬁeld at 2, 10, and 50 cm depths

    (Figure 2d). The TDR-315 sensor houses the entire measurement

    circuitry, including a microprocessor, within the sensor head and

    communicates with a datalogger for transfer of processed data via

    the SDI-12 protocol. The TDR-measured soil moisture data were

    recorded at 15-min intervals with CR1000 dataloggers (Campbell

    Scientiﬁc, Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The data used for this study

    are from an energy sorghum phenotyping experiment conducted

    from September 1 to October 28, 2018.

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

    TRSWIR-SAVI Feature Space for Soil

    Moisture Estimation With OPTRAM

    The

    TRSWIR-SAVI

    trapezoidal

    space

    was

    generated

    via

    integration of ﬁve scenes collected at the initial stage (i.e.,

    bare soil), during sorghum development, and at the ﬁnal growth

    stage (i.e., before harvest) from the beginning of September to the

    end of October, 2018. The advantages of the integrated trapezoid

    are increased computational eﬃciency and independence of

    dry- and wet-edge parameters from the growth stage. The

    dry- and wet-edges and their associated parameters (Figures 1

    and 4) were determined via manual ﬁtting. This is justiﬁable

    because of the very distinct geometry exhibited by the measured

    FIGURE 5 | OPTRAM SM estimates compared with the reference TDR

    measurements at the three sensor nest locations.

    TRSWIR-SAVI relationship during the sorghum experiment

    (Figure 4). Furthermore, Babaeian et al. (2018) demonstrated

    with a thorough sensitivity analysis that the selection of the dry-

    and wet-edge locations does not need to be overly precise for

    the OPTRAM to accurately estimate surface soil moisture. It

    should be noted that the more homogeneous soil and vegetation

    cover conditions in agricultural ﬁelds in conjunction with

    ultrahigh spatial resolution observations alleviate problems

    with OPTRAM parameterization occasionally experienced for

    large scale, coarse-resolution satellite observations, such as

    oversaturation of the wet-edge or uncertainty associated with

    image pixels that neither belong to the soil nor to vegetation (e.g.,

    surface water bodies, roads, or buildings) (Sadeghi et al., 2017).

    Soil Moisture Estimation With OPTRAM

    To evaluate the accuracy of the OPTRAM SM estimates, they

    were compared with the TDR reference measurements at the

    three sensor nest locations. The SM contents measured with the

    TDR sensors throughout the growth period ranged from 0.029 to

    0.465 cm3 cm−3. The OPTRAM SM was obtained by averaging

    the pixels directly covering the TDR sensor locations (i.e., an

    area of 30 times 50 cm). It is interesting to note that because

    of the ultrahigh resolution, the data volume generated for such

    a small area with the TERRA-REF Vis-NIR and SWIR imaging

    systems exceeds several gigabytes for a single scene. Figure 5

    depicts the correlation between OPTRAM-determined SM and

    the TDR reference measurements at 2, 10, and 50 cm depths,

    with correlation coeﬃcients (R) ranging from 0.66 to 0.83 and

    root mean square errors (RMSE) from 0.045 to 0.057 cm3 cm−3,

    which is considered reasonably accurate for remote sensing of SM

    (Entekhabi et al., 2014). Because of the limited penetration depth

    of Vis-NIR and SWIR electromagnetic radiation it was expected

    that the OPTRAM SM estimates better match the near-surface

    (2-cm) TDR reference measurements. However, there is also an

    obvious correlation between the OPTRAM estimates and root-

    zone SM (Figure 5), which contradicts the common presumption

    that surface soil moisture is decoupled from the root-zone (Qiu

    et al., 2014, 2016; Tayfur et al., 2014). Our results support ﬁndings

    in Sadeghi et al. (2019) and Koster et al. (2018), who established

    links between near-surface SM and the SM in deeper depths,

    and are in line with results shown in Wu and Dickinson (2004)

    and Ford et al. (2014), who demonstrate that root-zone SM can

    be accurately inferred from SWIR remote sensing observations.

    It is interesting to note that the OPTRAM SM estimates can

    be applied to directly calculate crop water consumption with

    a new analytical approach based on inversion of the linearized

    Richard’s equation (Sadeghi et al., 2019). Furthermore, OPTRAM

    SM time series could be coupled with numerical water ﬂow

    models to simulate root-zone moisture dynamics considering

    plant water uptake.

    Figure 6 depicts the OPTRAM soil moisture distributions

    across sensor nest location 1 at ultrahigh spatial resolution (i.e.,

    2-mm pixel size) for the early stage of sorghum development

    (September 28), close to maturity (October 9), and short

    before harvest (October 18). The maps clearly indicate the

    OPTRAM’s capability to capture soil moisture variations when

    parameterized with ultrahigh resolution Vis-NIR and SWIR

    observations, not only for single scenes, but also for various

    soil moisture states related to irrigation and plant development

    stage. This instills conﬁdence that the proposed method

    is amenable for parameterization with high-resolution UAS

    observations, which opens new avenues for farm scale precision

    irrigation management to increase crop water use eﬃciency

    while alleviating the risk of environmental contamination and

    contributing to conservation of strained water resources in water-

    limited regions of the world.

    CONCLUSIONS

    This contribution should be viewed as a proof of concept for

    the applicability of the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM)

    for estimation of SM when parameterized with remotely-sensed

    ultrahigh resolution Vis-NIR and SWIR reﬂectance data. A

    comparison of the OPTRAM SM estimates with reference

    moisture data obtained with state-of-the-art TDR sensors reveals

    the promising potential of the model to be applied in conjunction

    with rapidly evolving UAS imaging capabilities. This opens

    new avenues for UAS-based farm-level precision irrigation

    management. Such technological advances are much- needed

    to combat the water crisis in the arid and semiarid regions

    of the world that is expected to further escalate in view

    of the rapidly growing human population and a changing

    global climate. The next step is to test OPTRAM with UAS

    observations and apply the obtained SM information for farm-

    level irrigation management.

    A growing world population and increases in food and energy consumption have placed
    production agriculture in a difficult situation. The rapid growth in food production
    through specialized operations such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned
    to satisfy increases in demand for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts
    on natural resources pose huge challenges for the sustainability of food production.
    The situation is direr for developing countries or rural regions of the world
    due to the limited resources available to farming communities in these regions.
    To avoid production agriculture being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest
    an alternate approach. One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources
    without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether
    it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative
    agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable
    agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global
    food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed
    holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external
    inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil
    quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing
    modern regenerative agriculture as well as integrated permaculture will improve
    soil health, ecosystem biodiversity, land and resource conservation, agricultural
    sustainability, and food security. Identifying and implementing practices towards
    regenerative agriculture, integrated permaculture, digital agriculture, and sustainable
    agricultural management utilizing modern agricultural technologies infused with
    data science (artificial intelligence [AI] or machine learning [ML]) is critical.

    network 1 INTRODUCTION For much of the last couple of decades, two simultaneous
    trends with potentials to compromise social, economic, and environmental sustainability
    have been receiving widespread attention, that is, global population and agriculture
    production. The world''s population continues to grow adding an estimated 83 million
    people per year with projections to reach an estimated 9.7 billion in 2050 with
    a vast contribution from developing countries (United Nations, 2019). Agricultural
    production increased concomitantly to meet increased global demand for food, fiber,
    and energy from surging world population along with rising incomes and abilities
    to purchase more. Even though the objectives of agricultural production systems
    have broadened, and have diversified, an ultimate goal of sustainable food security
    remains. The critical question that keeps arising is whether agricultural production
    systems especially in developing countries can continue to meet their goals sustainably
    or not. Alexandratos (1999), for example, argues that for any agricultural practices
    to be sustainable, meeting the food and fiber needs of the present population,
    should in no way compromise either the food security or the economic, social,
    and environmental elements used in the process for future generations. The need
    for greater food productivity has been satisfied in parts, while it became more
    than double over the last number of years through monoculture. This monoculture
    can be explained as a cropping system model emphasizing specialization and productive
    efficiency, that has largely guided modern agriculture (Asbjornsen et al., 2014;
    Tilman et al., 2002). Tied in with such intensive industrial food production was
    another agricultural farming practice, which in itself was revolutionary. Known
    as the Green Revolution, food production from these agricultural systems resulted
    in remarkable growth (Pingali, 2012). In consolidation with new technologies,
    high-yielding genetically modified crop varieties, agrochemicals (inorganic fertilizers,
    pesticides) and controlled water supply contributed to large increases in crop
    productivity. Undoubtedly, both the green revolution and monoculture cropping
    systems presented clear benefits. Economies of scale has contributed considerably
    to farms’ economic performance through improved production efficiencies and lower
    production costs. This in turn has led to numerous opportunities for agricultural
    producers to not only feed an increasing world population, but simultaneously
    improve human health and nutrition through the delivery of specialized nutrient-rich
    crops and animal products (Bouis & Saltzman, 2017). At the field level, the many
    benefits of specialized mono-cropping systems to meet the vast new demand opportunities
    supplying large quantities of food and energy have been extensively reported (Dai
    & Dong, 2014; Meng et al., 2013; Tilman et al., 2002). Currently, these benefits
    and gains in many instances have either been lost or diminished because of the
    inability to balance the advantages and disadvantages. These specialized cropping
    systems due to their strong reliance on external inputs have raised present and
    future challenges to the sustainable use of our natural resources. Modern agriculture
    therefore does have serious implications for sustainability and requires judicious
    management strategy moving forward. Modern agriculture practices have resulted
    in adverse unintended consequences detrimental to environmental quality and sustainability
    (Power, 2010). Further, the pursuit of monoculture benefits has been disproportional
    as the negative consequences are particularly more serious in developing countries.
    Environmental and ecological problems such as land degradation (Diacono & Montemurro,
    2010), loss of biodiversity (Isbell et al., 2017; Nicholls & Altieri, 2013) and
    water pollution (Sebilo et al., 2013) have disproportionally affected and simultaneously
    revealed the vulnerabilities of poorer communities or farmers with limited resources
    in developing countries (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014) (Figure 1). Core Ideas  Intensive
    agriculture can cause a loss in biodiversity and concerns for global food security.  Regenerative
    agriculture and integrative permaculture are keys to address food security.  Digital
    agricultural tools can aid in attaining agricultural and environmental sustainability.  Precision
    agriculture should be implemented as an agricultural decision support system.  Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning can guide integrated agricultural input management.
    FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Flow chart showing the targets to achieve agricultural
    sustainability through integrative permaculture and regenerative agriculture using
    modern agricultural tools to attain global food security Opposite to monoculture,
    permaculture is regarded as a farming system that uses conventional practices
    coupled with new approaches that combine natural, ecological, and economic factors
    into the monoculture production system (Figure 1). Permaculture is considered
    an umbrella term that describes a broad range of practices and systems to optimize
    the interactions between the soil–plant systems. It efficiently utilizes various
    ecological functionalities to maximize both ecosystem health and providing a broad
    suite of ecosystem services (Gambiza, 2019). The ethos of permaculture is not
    only the efficient functioning of natural systems but for activities that work
    in tandem and embodies human health and well-being. It embraces a few principles
    and ethics to promote sustainable agricultural production which in turn promotes
    diverse and resilient agroecosystems (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014; Fiebrig et al.,
    2020). Permaculture can also be broken down into individual aspects composed of
    different elements or measures addressing each aspect of agricultural production
    but collectively it can remediate the problems of present-day agriculture. For
    instance, the first strategy tackles biodiversity, the second focuses on interactions,
    the third combines creativity and innovations, and the fourth embraces adaptive
    management (Ferguson & Lovell,  2014). The underlying principles of permaculture
    as a major driver in sustaining rural economies and cultures have long existed
    and are similar to multifunctional agriculture (Marsden & Sonnino, 2008). Permaculture
    has always been about the whole system''s design, a fundamental principle that
    all components of a system are interrelated (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014). Recently,
    modifications and a shift in notions took place to leverage advancements in agronomic
    and animal husbandry operationalization that also consider societal and ethical
    aspects (Akhtar et al., 2016; Ingram, 2018; Thrall et al., 2010). To some extent,
    modern agriculture has ignored the associations on the whole-farm level focusing
    solely on inputs or factors of production (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers). Permaculture
    views many of the various farming activities as being co-independent. For example,
    permaculture advocates for farmers to consider pests or weeds when making fertilizer
    decisions (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Similarly, permaculture encourages crop rotation
    that involves more than two crops where such numbers provide the best solutions
    for maintaining soil fertility and improving soil moisture, control pests, or
    provide pollination services (Asbjornsen et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2010). A
    few recent studies have reported the role of permaculture in creating resilient
    and productive landscapes and communities (Aznar-Sánchez et al., 2019; Ferguson
    & Lovell, 2014) (Figure 1). Evidence from these studies suggests that permaculture
    is not entirely a new concept but one which has grown over time (Ferguson & Lovell,
    2014). We conceptualized and evaluated scenarios of problems and disadvantages
    associated with monoculture, summarized the benefits of permaculture to overall
    ecosystem services, evaluated implications of regenerative modern agriculture,
    and integrated permaculture to achieve global food security. This perspective
    suggests that the incorporation of modern agricultural technologies and integration
    of data science artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with agricultural
    resource management will help address global food security challenges. Future
    research works should be tailored to adopt a more holistic input efficient, resilient,
    regenerative-based production system, and output-based system to optimize agricultural
    production while reducing the environmental footprint. 2 MONOCULTURE CROPPING
    SYSTEMS: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES Monoculture plays a key role in land degradation
    (Pacheco et al., 2018) which over time develops into a myriad of other environmental
    (e.g., reduction in land productivity, soil erosion, water quality deterioration,
    loss of biodiversity, and dysfunctionality of ecosystem etc.) problems (Figure
    1). As monoculture activities continue to intensify, soil and water erosion and
    fertility loss are directly affecting the quality and productivity of soil health
    (Crews et al., 2018). Approximately 17% of otherwise fertile vegetative land has
    been degraded and rendered unproductive due to anthropogenic activities (Tilman
    et al., 2002). It has also been reported recently that such loss represents a
    minimum of 3% of global agricultural gross domestic product (Baskan et al., 2017).
    Due to intensive cultivation, deforestation, climate change, and farming marginal
    lands, developing countries are most likely to suffer high erosion rates which
    are generally accompanied by reductions in the provisioning of ecosystem services
    (Labrière et al., 2015). As per recent FAO interpretation, the situation will
    more likely become worse in the absence of meaningful interventions (FAO, 2015).
    Thus, soil preservation and quality are considered as critical factors in supporting
    agroecosystem services to address current and future food security concerns. Top
    soil constitutes the majority of organic matter and more than half of the essential
    primary available nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
    needed for plant growth and productivity (Brady & Weill, 2010). Soils affected
    by high erosion rates and the associated removal of their top soils are therefore
    subjected to large nutrient loss and decreased soil fertility. Long-term expansion
    of natural ecosystems to row crop agriculture and intense use of agrochemicals
    (fertilizer and pesticides) is therefore not only a major threat to soil fertility
    but have caused contamination of ground and surface water. There have been numerous
    examples of agricultural contributions to water pollution (Dodds et al., 2009;
    Foy & Kirk, 1995). Mitigation efforts are therefore badly needed to abate the
    present situation. Controlling nutrient transfer from farmland depends on both
    a reduction in inputs use, as well as how they are managed to reduce mobilization
    (Goulding et al., 2008). Land degradation and climate change are inextricably
    linked as intensive farming practices such as conventional tillage, forest clearing,
    biomass burning, excessive use of inorganic fertilizer, etc., have been a major
    contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions (Grace et al., 2011; Lacanne &
    Lundgren, 2018). Agricultural activities contribute approximately 30% of total
    greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and
    animal wastes, a rate which is expected to increase due to growing global population
    and elevated food production demand (IAEA, 2019). Alternative forms of input-efficient
    agriculture such as regenerative agriculture and permaculture are generally focused
    on soil carbon (C) sequestration have been suggested as possible solutions to
    produce positive outcomes on greenhouse gas budgets (Smith et al., 2019). Monoculture''s
    nexus of concerns is more of a threat to developing countries since agriculture
    continues to be the principal source of revenue and means of support for many
    rural families (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014). It has been investigated that developing
    countries with little adaptation capacities are the territories most likely to
    face severe food insecurity (UNCTAD & Ulrich, 2011). To that end, the scourge
    to food security is closely linked to vulnerabilities in the cropping system promoting
    a production culture relying heavily on mechanization and agrochemicals which
    poses deleterious impacts on the ecosystems (Crews et al., 2018). The situation
    is further exacerbated because poorer countries have little safeguards against
    externalities in the first place. Further, they are normally located in mostly
    arid and semi-arid regions with marginal soils and are more prone to the negative
    effects of climate change limiting their abilities to compete with industrialized
    economies. Recent meta-analysis have listed that land degradation, depletion,
    and pollution of physical, chemical, and biological resources of the environment,
    and their associated disproportionate costs as the primary negative results from
    row crop agriculture and its narrow focus (de Graaff et al., 2019; Pothula et
    al., 2019). While a variety of measures to mitigate the environmental externalities
    have been explored, challenges remain (Foley et al., 2011). For instance, agriculture
    remains the single largest nonpoint source of water pollutants (Dowd et al., 2008;
    EPA, 2000). Additionally, there is still the threat to human health from occupational
    workers and consumer exposure to pesticides (Lam et al., 2017). Sustainability
    in food security is not an insurmountable problem. Some notable solutions that
    have been suggested to solve the problems of achieving sustainable agricultural
    production and food security have been agroecology, ecological intensification,
    sustainable intensification (SI) and regenerative agriculture (Bommarco et al.,
    2013; Cassman, 1999; Pretty & Bharucha, 2014; Tomich et al., 2011). 3 REGENERATIVE
    AGRICULTURE: THE SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES Regenerative
    agriculture is a set of approaches that emphasizes and make the most of naturally
    occurring beneficial soil–plant interactions, relying less on external inputs
    and taking advantage of ecological agricultural practices (Perry, 1995). The empirical
    impacts of regenerative agricultural practices are still in their incipient state
    and not widely followed by farmers. The literal meaning of “regeneration” when
    applied to agriculture means reconditioning a land to a higher state after it
    has been utilized for crop production using a variety of technical management
    practices (Figure 1). The process is a series of transformational adaptation in
    agriculture that emerges and catalyzed due to crisis and alternative techniques
    introduced to address the farming challenges (Gosnell et al., 2019). Soil is considered
    as the base for regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). Although regenerative agriculture
    is related to crop canopy and site-specific crop management, it is also centric
    to soil (Schreefel et al., 2020). Therefore, maintaining soil fertility by optimizing
    nutrient concentrations or strengthening crop protection strategies in agricultural
    fields by enhancing disease resistance ability of soil are key objectives to adopt
    regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). The literal meaning of “regeneration” is
    aligned with the concept of soil resilience under changing climate scenario. Therefore,
    the overarching objective is to create, support, and maintain the natural biogeochemical
    cycle and interdependence aimed at improving agricultural and food systems sustainability
    (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). Indigenous agricultural practices have traditionally
    focused on enhancing productivity while maintaining soil health. Three sister
    cropping in the indigenous communities like Navajo, Cahokian, Mvskoke, Mississipian
    tribes of the United States focuses on growing corn (Zea mays L.), squash (Cucurbita
    spp.), and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the same field (Hill, 2020; Mt. Pleasant,
    2006). Employing symbiotic and companion plant relationships, corn, the staple
    food of most tribes provides support for the climbing bean, which in turn provide
    N to the soil for all three plants through N2 fixation. The third plant squash,
    acts as a cover crop and mulch, suppresses weeds and pests, protects soil from
    erosion as well as conserving soil moisture for the benefit of all three plants.
    On the other hand, legumes growing in the same field fixes N in the soil to support
    the growth of three crops. In this integrative approach of sustainability, livestock
    forms the essential part of regenerative agriculture. The grazing pattern of sheep
    and cattle significantly impacts increased grass production and increased C sequestration
    in rangelands. Regenerative rotational grazing of sheep can increase topsoil organic
    C up to 3.6% with 30% higher springtime grass production (Díaz de Otálora et al.,
    2021). Biometric sensors and AI techniques in digital livestock farming are emerging
    tools in modern agriculture (Neethirajan & Kemp, 2021). The applications of these
    tools not only facilitate administering the health of livestock but can also allow
    for precision monitoring of the intensity of grazing in rangelands. These sensor
    nodes are intended to function as a wireless sensor network by attaching to the
    body of the livestock to compare the real-time activity of the grazing intensity
    data and inform the growers for immediate attention if readings are over or under
    the reference standards of the database (Hwang & Yoe, 2011). The advancements
    in precision livestock farming using proximal and biometric sensors allows for
    the monitoring of the physiological and behavioral health of the livestock over
    time and space (Neethirajan, 2017). The integration of biometric sensors with
    bioinformatics and AI algorithms can also help in identifying desirable traits
    of cattle for breeding programs (Ellen et al., 2019). The degradation of topsoil
    can be avoided by increasing the soil organic C in the rhizosphere. Recent studies
    on the inclusion of cover crops in agricultural rotations have shown significant
    increases in soil organic C (Jian et al., 2020). Including legume cover crops
    in the soil also enhances the soil biological activity and increased plant-available
    N (Sullivan & Andrews, 2012). In integrated crop–livestock farming, cover crops
    facilitate reconditioning of soils due to their crop diversity and mitigate ecological
    constraints. Using annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as a cover crop has
    shown an increase in the average daily weight of livestock while also maintaining
    crop diversity (Planisich et al., 2021). Similarly, the application of green manure
    [crops grown and turned into the soil to enhance and improve their nutritive qualities,
    for example, Sesbania rostrata (Brem.)] with organic amendments has been shown
    to improve soil physical, chemical, and microbial activities (Maitra et al., 2018).
    Green manure with organic amendments under reduced tillage have shown to improve
    aggregate stability, higher content of N, P, exchangeable cations, and microbial
    respiration in orchard crops (Luján Soto et al., 2021). The incorporation of regenerative
    agricultural practices into cropping systems can increase nutrient cycling and
    subsequent soil health through a number of mechanisms. For example, the addition
    of N to the soil through symbiotic N2 fixation of legumes (Peyraud et al., 2014).
    Fornara and Tilman (2009) described the improvements in soil structure and health
    from increased soil organic matter, soil microorganisms and biological activities
    from increased plant diversity during decomposition. Then there is the decreased
    nutrient loss and increased soil water retention from increased plant diversity
    which increases crop productivity (Florence & McGuire, 2020) while simultaneously
    decreasing environmental contamination. Both diverse agronomic managements and
    cropping systems are key components of an integrated pest management system. Flood
    (2010) reported that agricultural pests including pathogens and weeds resulted
    up to a third of crop loss. There is very good evidence that regenerative agriculture
    and permaculture which affords both diversity in time, space, crops, and agronomic
    practices allows for both the alteration of host and nonhost crop species and
    simultaneously eliminating or reducing host and nonhost crop pests (Chauvel et
    al., 2001; Petit et al., 2018). This in turn reduces the use of synthetic pesticides
    and resulting negative environmental consequences such as aquatic pollution and
    reduction of beneficial pollinator populations. The practice of regenerative agriculture
    is especially beneficial for the small farming system since it lacks the necessary
    financial resources for more intensive agricultural production systems. Whereas
    environment, climate, and financial resources have had diverse effects on agriculture
    infrastructure in developing countries they still have the same supports and infrastructure
    for regenerative agriculture. This is because regenerative agriculture is an approach
    that emphasizes practices that are location specific. Any approach that tailored
    agriculture practices to local circumstances are more likely to be successful
    in alleviating problems in agricultural food supplies because initiatives are
    focused on local production systems and local economies (Clover, 2003). Thus far,
    limited research has been documented to describe and evaluate the comparisons
    of various regenerative agriculture practices. A greater ecosystem services and
    profitability for farmers have been generated by regenerative agriculture than
    a highly intensive monoculture corn cropping system in a study throughout the
    northern plains of the United States (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). The significance
    of regenerative agriculture is that it adopts goals such as sustainability through
    water and nutrient recycling and preservation. Studies showed a reduction in the
    depletion of natural resources from regenerative agriculture which has increased
    the provisioning of ecosystems services and local economies (Czekaj et al., 2020;
    Duncan, 2016; Luján Soto et al., 2021). Regenerative agriculture also calls attention
    to the wide range of opportunities that exist for farmers to use local organic
    waste in their agronomic management practices (Larney & Angers, 2012). Another
    important requirement for regenerative agriculture is the integration of agricultural
    processes for environmental stewardship that is critical for a sustainable food
    future with a positive outcome in long-term food security. 4 SUSTAINABLE FOOD
    FUTURE UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE The burgeoning population along with the high demand
    for global food production under changing climate has necessitated conditions
    to conserve available natural resources for sustainable agriculture production.
    It is predicted that climate change will bring about extreme weather conditions
    such as drought, flood, fire, hurricane, frost, and infrequent and uneven precipitation
    which will impact crop yields and reduce available land under traditional cropping
    systems (Olesen & Bindi, 2002). Under these changing climates saving water, increasing
    water use efficiency, soil nutrient management, and protecting crops from adverse
    environmental conditions are important considerations to develop future agricultural
    strategies. Modern agriculture has adapted to new strategies, which involve new
    innovative/transformative technologies and sustainable intensification of agriculture
    (Figure 2). Urban agricultural productions systems including micro- (e.g., green
    roofs, green walls, courtyards, backyards, street verges etc.), meso-(e.g., community
    gardens, community allotments, urban parks etc.), and macro-scales have also been
    proven to be sustainable models (Nandwani, 2016). Improved crop genotypes tolerant
    to drought are being used in developing countries, for example, drought-tolerant
    maize developed by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and
    The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have increased maize
    yields by 20–30% under drought conditions in Africa. Gene editing for seed improvements
    can produce more crops and improve nutrition outcomes. Further, the micro-dosing
    technique of fertilizer placement has helped many smallholder agricultural farmers
    to increase their sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and millet (Panicum miliaceum
    L.) yields by 44–120% in Africa (Fan, 2020). Additionally, biofortification of
    foods using plant breeding as a cutting-edge approach has enabled increased vitamin
    and mineral density in crops using plant breeding and transgenic techniques (Bouis
    & Saltzman, 2017). Solar-powered irrigation pumps are one of Africa''s most promising
    solutions to climate change adaption and mitigation, and have contributed to reductions
    in hunger and malnutrition (Mohammed Wazed et al., 2018). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Various ways of adopting modern agricultural technologies as part of regenerative
    and precision agricultural systems to attain agricultural and environmental sustainability
    The SI targets environmental sustainability while tackling climate change and
    producing more food with less natural resources. Climate-smart agriculture is
    the new SI which is an integrative approach to increase agricultural productivity
    to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security, and development.
    It helps to adapt and build the resilience of agricultural and food security systems
    to climate change at multiple levels, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    from agriculture (Chandra et al., 2018; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2017; Taylor, 2018).
    China implemented another strategy for sustainable development known as Agricultural
    Green Development, which coordinates “green” with “development”. It aims to transform
    current agriculture with high resource consumption and high environmental costs
    into green agriculture in rural areas with high productivity, high resource use
    efficiency, and low environmental impact (Shen et al., 2020). 5 RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY
    FOR SUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE Despite progress in agricultural
    production and productivity, environmental and ecological challenges such as soil
    erosion, nutrient leaching, and soil and water pollution persist that ultimately
    limits many ecosystems functions. Agricultural diversification that operates outside
    the established goals of just “productive efficiency” and greater profits would
    be critical in achieving food security (Brunori et al., 2013; Gomiero et al.,
    2011; Lasley et al., 1993; Marsden, 2004). Agroecosystems based on integrated
    systems of low input farming can help address the shortcomings of monoculture
    and contribute to more sustainable food security and food sovereignty. The regenerative
    agriculture approach involves farming systems that are more responsive to biological
    and ecosystem interactions rather than only yields and output. More holistic focused
    agriculture can contribute to bolstered food security, especially for rural farming
    communities in developing countries. The critical aspect of modern sustainable
    and regenerative agriculture is to adopt multiple modern agricultural technologies
    along with managing agricultural inputs precisely. Few such traditional practices
    are being used from the last two decades in different parts of the worlds as follows:  Irrigation
    scheduling based on daily historical crop evapotranspiration is potentially a
    prospective method for increasing water use efficiency by reducing soil water
    evaporation and preventing groundwater depletion especially in low rainfall regions
    (Bonachela et al., 2006).  Screen house in a large field set-up (e.g., banana
    [Musa X paradisiaca L.] farm) enabled a 30% increase in water use efficiency in
    developing countries (Tanny et al., 2015).  Closed-loop systems which are soilless
    irrigation systems in hydroponic arrangement that helps reduce the amount of water
    needed for irrigation while optimizing the nutrient management in an urban agriculture
    farm setting have promoted sustainable environmental practices by reducing irrigated
    water use by 40% as well as fertilizer use by 35–54% per day (Rufí-Salís et al.,
    2020).  Soilless culture using crop coefficient for irrigation has been another
    way to improve water use efficiency in recirculating systems that recapture drain
    water for reuse especially in a limited resource and low-cost farming systems
    in developing countries (Gruda, 2009).  Slow release biofertilizers, produced
    by encapsulation technology, can breakdown nutrients and make them available to
    plants for longer durations, thus enhancing plant growth and productivity while
    mitigating environmental pollution and nutrient leaching (Chen et al., 2014; Ju
    et al., 2009).  Phi-based farming system, as an emerging novel strategy in modern
    agriculture can potentially minimize the algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs
    generated from P fertilizers application in agricultural fields (Chaudhary et
    al., 2020).  Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on reduced tillage, maintaining
    crop residues as soil cover, and crop rotation and is highly promoted for sustainable
    soil management practiced in North and South America (Hobbs et al., 2008; Kassam
    et al., 2009).  Fertilizer deep placement (FDP) was developed for Asian rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) systems in the 1980s. This method involves placing the compressed briquettes
    of fertilizer deeper in the soil (>10 cm), close to the roots of transplanted
    rice which drastically increased rice grain yields while reducing the amount of
    required fertilizer (Roger et al., 1980). Many modern agricultural technologies
    are being used and suggested as a part of precision and regenerative agriculture
    as well as integrative permaculture (Figure 2) as follows:  Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) and variable rate nutrient (VRN) technology: VRI is variable rate irrigation
    system that applies irrigation according to detailed mapping and monitoring of
    soil variability thereby reducing drainage losses (Trout et al., 2008).  In a
    VRI system, sensors can unlock the full potential of variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) systems enabling optimal water applications in an irrigated cropping system.
    Evans and King (2010) reported water savings of up to 26% for a wide range of
    crop such as corn, pasture, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean [Glycine max
    (L.) Merr.], sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
    Mill.).  The VRN is variable rate nutrient technology where nutrients are applied
    to match up the soil and crop requirement to prevent nutrient loss and increase
    efficiency. These technologies utilize a range of approaches covering sensor-based
    approaches, real-time sensors, and feedback controls to measure soil properties
    or crop characteristics and immediately use this signal to control the variable-rate
    applicator. They are helpful to deal with soil spatial heterogeneity varying rates
    of irrigation and nutrient. Variable-rate irrigation decreased about 80–85% annual
    load of N and P downstream as compared to uniform rate irrigation (URI) in a long-term
    study conducted under an intensively grazed dairy system (McDowell, 2017). It
    was found to be potentially a useful approach for irrigation management for improving
    crop yield in an onion (Allium cepa L.) field in the humid environment of England
    (González Perea et al., 2018). In another study with an irrigated corn crop, Bausch
    and Diker (2001) reported that VRI technology reduced N fertilizer application
    by 39 kg N ha–1 with no reduction in corn grain yield.  Water smart agriculture
    project in Central America helped small farmers develop long-term digital soil
    mapping system which enables wise use of natural resources in the present context
    of growing global challenges for food security under changing climate (Owens et
    al., 2020).  DSSAT for Conservation, Optimization and Precision Agriculture: A
    real-time control and optimization in irrigation management system has been presented
    as a potential option for water savings by Koech and Langat (2018). Decision Support
    System in Agricultural Technologies (DSSAT) can provide fundamental support to
    the growers to decide and optimize their practices for precise nutrient, water,
    energy, and pest management. These integrated solutions by combining soil or canopy-based
    sensors or spectral/thermal imagery with cloud-based telemetric services allows
    for easy management of the crop field throughout the growing season without going
    to the field to take in-situ intensive measurements (Bazzani, 2005; Rinaldi &
    He, 2014).  The trend of using multiple sensors and spectral imagery available
    for a wide range of cropping and agricultural systems would address the issue
    of global food security by minimizing the environmental footprint. Figure 3 represents
    the Irrigation Decision Support System (IDSS) using spectral imagery for determining
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of three agricultural fields in
    the Central Valley of California. The dark brown bands in Figure 3a shows low
    emergence and vigor due to low NDVI. On the contrary, the green bands in Figure
    3b and c show uniform emergence. Identifying the dark brown to orange bands in
    Figure 3a and b is useful for the grower to precisely manage the areas that required
    attention in terms of nutrient or moisture management.  Remote sensing and aerial
    image-based technology: Utilization and applying remote sensing with proximal
    image processing to manage agricultural inputs such as nutrients, soil, or water
    is a recent trend. A recent review concluded that crop water use efficiency can
    be increased by characterizing water bodies using satellite-based technologies
    such as proximal and remote sensing (Cancela et al., 2019). Future agricultural
    production would rely more on remote sensing techniques to better utilize agricultural
    inputs. The recent development and utilization of drone-based technology in agricultural
    field to implement best management practices as well as integrated pest management
    for crop production have drawn much attention. A good review of examples and application
    is presented in Bastiaanssen et al. (2000).  Drone-based technology: Drones, which
    are not currently in full use for most agriculture operations but have become
    increasingly affordable is another promising option. Drone use will enable farmers
    to improve yields by monitoring crops more frequently and accurately, allowing
    for more controlled and precise pesticide and fertilizer applications, intervening
    remotely when necessary (Puri et al., 2017).  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs):
    The WSNs can be used as a sophisticated and useful tool of precision agriculture
    management to aid in agricultural decision-making systems (e.g., irrigation water
    or fertilizer application monitoring systems. Lately, researcher have shown WSNs
    as an efficient way of managing agricultural field through these WSNs technologies
    (Adão et al., 2017; Jawad et al., 2017). These various wireless communication
    systems are more flexible options to manage soil, water, nutrients, and would
    bring revolution in sustainable agricultural production systems.  Regenerative
    irrigation practices: We can potentially follow the relatively new concept of
    “regenerative irrigation” as a part of regenerative agriculture to increase resource
    efficiency such as using fewer chemical fertilizers, more residue-based materials,
    reusing wastewater to increase the irrigation water use efficiency and decrease
    farm energy input. One such study has demonstrated the positive impact of bio-based
    input into the agricultural production system to boost the farm economy (Rodias
    et al., 2020).  Digital Soil Mapping (DSM): A component of water smart agriculture
    is to generate relevant informative maps of soil types, properties, and functions
    for sustainable soil and water management. This approach can be multi-level and
    its functionality can help farmers in their decision-making process (Barron, 2012;
    Falkenmark et al., 2009; Falkenmark, 2013) especially in drought-prone areas during
    challenging times of climate change (Eitzinger et al., 2012). FIGURE 3 Open in

    Inc. 6 ADAPTING INTEGRATED APPROACH: REGENERATIVE AND MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
    A narrow single approach that focuses only on conventional principles of agriculture
    production will not be sufficient to address the issue of global food security
    in the future. The key to maintaining a long-term and self-sustaining food security
    system relies upon adapting a broad encompassing approach, one for example that
    combines the fundamentals and the inter-relatedness of many different disciplines
    such as statistics and computer science. The proper combination of specific technology
    that can not only provide indicators but tangible spatial measurements should
    be a priority. Considerable scope exists for a diverse range of such technologies
    and sensors with diverse capabilities. For example, biodegradable soil moisture
    sensors that not only monitor but provides soil moisture measurements could be
    available for farmers within the next 3 yr (McCauley, 2020). Also available are
    yield and weed mapping sensors, which can sense differences in production environment
    allowing farmers to quickly monitor these variables. The utilization of other
    available sensors such as climate and ground sensors that monitor a plant''s response
    to climate is another promising option and should be a priority. Data from sensors
    can measure and provide advanced analytics for early scouting of potential problems
    such as pest or weed infestation. The remote monitoring of pest activity using
    passive infra-red (PIR) sensing in pest traps has allowed the identification of
    target pests by having a low risk to secondary poisoning when baits are used and
    restricts the accidental deaths to non-target species (Parsons et al., 2020).
    The implementation of remote sensing techniques using wireless telemetric services
    aim to provide decision support to the growers for effective management of crops.
    The advances in drone imagery for multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral mapping
    can avoid physical deployment of baits on large farms for commercial production.
    Recent advances in wireless sensor assembly using nanomaterials in combination
    with novel mutant enzymes with progressive integrative with solar cells has enriched
    the possibilities for development of biosensors for detecting the photosynthetic
    inhibiting herbicides (Bucur et al., 2018). The advancements in biosensor development
    using nanomaterials requires extensive research to monitor residual effects in
    the soil and biota of the environment. Remote sensing which includes the above-mentioned
    technologies along with satellite imagery (Figure 3a–c) and global information
    system once more fully adopted will go a long way towards achieving food security.
    Farming in controlled agricultural environments is another viable and promising
    option. Controlled in-house farming uses the benefits and efficiencies of precision
    agriculture to provide the optimal conditions to grow crops in an environmentally
    friendly way. This innovation offers farmers greater predictability as crops can
    be produced year-round since production is not affected by extreme weather or
    climatic conditions (Ramin Shamshiri et al., 2018). Nanotechnology is another
    promising technology that increases production while allowing for control and
    management of inputs. The technology is a set of nanotools capable of detecting
    minute differences or deficiencies in parameters such as soil nutrients, soil
    temperatures, plant health, or the presence of pathogens. This then allows for
    specific corrective responses to deliver with high levels of precision (Prasad
    et al., 2017) to maintain the health of both soils and plants. Despite the potential
    benefits of modern digital (e.g., DSSAT model) and climate-smart agricultural
    practices, its adoption can be challenging especially under small-to-medium-scale
    farming systems with limited farm resources. Two critical factors we should focus
    on providing the ultimate benefits of smart agriculture technologies involve:
    (a) farm size and (b) input–output cost benefit of the farm production. For example,
    site-specific and optimized irrigation management can be achieved through real-time
    soil moisture or crop canopy temperature data. On a bigger scale, spectral imagery
    acquired by aerial flights or satellite data can precisely estimate water stress.
    Therefore, the selection of decision support for moisture management depends on
    farm size or farm resource availability. In general, for small-scale and subsistence
    farms, sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature, and other parameters
    (e.g., Watermark sensors, Irrometer tensiometer etc.) can be performed easily
    with grower''s mobile services. These direct and affordable web applications can
    provide easy, inexpensive, and accessible knowledge of the moisture status in
    field and help in irrigation scheduling. However, application of spectral imagery
    (e.g., Ceres Imaging Inc.) might not be accommodating for small-scale farming
    given economic constraints. Often, the knowledge and solutions for small-scale
    and limited resource farms depend on the understanding of factors that influence
    social-behavioral change, and the indicators they select to monitor those processes.
    Today''s digital agriculture is being supported by either web-based decision support
    tools or smartphone applications for pest or disease recognition. It would be
    interesting to see how these tools are being used effectively by the farming community
    to improve their existing farming practices. Therefore, the end-user adoption
    of this information can only be useful if the interpretation is user-friendly
    to the growers. For example, reporting NDVI in agricultural fields with a color
    range from green (∼uniformity and good vigor) to orange to red (∼stressed plants)
    could effectively be implemented as part of precision crop management (Figure
    3). The recent pandemic has influenced the farmers'' decisions about farm management
    practices. Thus, the strategies to develop and continue sustainable agricultural
    practices using digital and precision technologies and tools under this situation
    were and would be critical. Therefore, growers across the world including small
    and limited resources farmers have to create new strategies for virtual and successful
    development of farming practices. For example, on-farm trials, virtual field days,
    virtually engaging farmers groups, development of digital decision support tools
    were newly initiated or continued as a part of previous farm management practices
    that engaged and empowered farmers under this pandemic condition. 7 INTEGRATIVE
    PERMACULTURE: FUSION OF DATA SCIENCES (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING)
    WITH MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY The advancement in agricultural technology
    has revolutionized the recent trends in precision agriculture. The groundbreaking
    development in acquiring big data from crop fields aims to minimize the environmental
    footprint. The developments in WSNs and drone technology have not only helped
    the agricultural sector in acquiring big and precise data for crop and soil management
    (Zhou et al., 2012), but has also allowed to achieve 4-R stewardship by avoiding
    the blanket approach of crop production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is
    collaborating with technological giants like Microsoft to help farmers cut costs
    of production and increase the yield by sustainably considering the global climate
    change. Integrating proximal sensing devices (e.g., portable X-ray fluorescence
    spectrometer, Vis-NIR spectrometry, NixPro) with predictive modeling techniques
    allows for rapid and in-situ elemental analysis by developing site-specific or
    region-specific models (Jha, Ulery, et al., 2021; Jha, Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2021;
    Mukhopadhyay et al., 2020; Weindorf et al., 2016). Additionally, inclusion of
    spatiotemparal imagery using multi and hyper-spectral mapping allows precise,
    optimized, and regenerative management of agricultural crops using properties
    like electrical conductivity, evapotranspiration, canopy cover, water stress,
    and vegetation index (Table 1), Nocco et al. (2019) investigated the implication
    of High-Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration (HRMET) model and aerial imagery
    to identify the potential benefits of water management in precision cultivation
    of sweet corn and potato crop rotations. Crop models similar to HRMET can widely
    be applied in comparing rotational practices using ground management vs. the model
    parameters. For example, the HRMET model has shown promising results for sweet
    corn and potato rotations when modeled evapotranspiration maps were compared to
    field observations in potato, sweet corn, and pea (Pisum sativum L.) agroecosystems
    (Nocco et al., 2019). This optimization towards irrigation management and application
    efficiency are effective in buffering against the climate variability. TABLE 1.

    have widely allowed monitoring the physiological crop stress, nutrient deficiency,
    crop pest, and diseases/weed management (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Lamb & Brown,
    2001; Mehra et al., 2016) and digital soil mapping (McBratney et al., 2019) (Table
    1). Machine learning algorithms allows for the development of risk assessment
    models that can help in making disease management decisions prior to the planting
    of crop like wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). For examples,
    techniques like Artificial Neural Networks and regression trees as mentioned in
    Table 1 can be used to help solve problems of Stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter
    wheat (Mehra et al., 2016). Similarly, Bayesian framework can also be used in
    automated identification and algorithmic identification of weeds in corn crops
    (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Tellaeche et al., 2008). Therefore, the algorithmic
    approach of AI and ML facilitate a reduction in residual toxicity and therefore
    achieve the sustainable goals of regenerative agriculture and integrative permaculture.
    Further, researchers have combined the knowledge of high-performance computing,
    sensor/drone technology, and ML algorithms for grain production. For example,
    comparison of red–green–blue, multispectral and thermal data of agricultural plots
    used to assess the genotypic differences in crop vigor and yield by ground and
    unmanned aerial vehicle measurements in wheat, reported similar platform proximity
    in yield assessment (Jha, Sihi, et al., 2021; Patrício & Rieder, 2018). Similarly,
    the aerial measurements due to their large spatial coverage provide improved reliability
    of management zone delineation by evaluating the variability across cropping areas
    (Khosla et al., 2010). The combination of big data modeling and clustering methods
    has enabled crop yield predictions according to management zone delineation (Pantazi
    et al., 2015). The clustering methods in crop yield predictions can be used in
    understanding the response of plant growth as a result of soil properties and
    their spatiotemporal variability. Groenendyk et al. (2014) investigated the relationship
    between plant growth and soil texture. For their study, the authors simulated
    wheat growth using HYDRUS 1D hydrological model and a k-means clustering algorithm
    approach. Results showed significant relationship between estimating crop yield
    and soil texture. Techniques involving artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been used in paddy production to estimate
    the in-farm emission of greenhouse gases throughout the growing season (Nabavi-Pelesaraei
    et al., 2018). This is useful in modeling the food-energy nexus in paddy production
    and creating an efficient system of minimizing the environmental impacts in a
    computationally inexpensive manner. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
    approach has also proved to be an important methodology to identify and correlate
    yield and variables impacting crop production (Emamgolizadeh et al., 2015; Zabihi
    et al., 2019). Turpin et al. (2005) has identified dominant factors affecting
    corn establishment and grain yields using MARS automated regression data mining
    method. Their study concluded that soil water content and cone penetration resistance
    are key parameters than elevation and mineralizable soil N in predicting crop
    establishment and grain yield. Padarian et al. (2020) used a probabilistic model
    to report the key research areas in soil science that utilizes ML techniques.
    Main topics included soil salinity (Khadim et al., 2019), soil organic C dynamics,
    soil moisture content (Greifeneder et al., 2019), pedometrics timeline (McBratney
    et al., 2019), spatial disaggregation (Flynn et al., 2019), soil mapping and modeling
    regional soil covariates (Caubet et al., 2019; Padarian et al., 2020), and soil
    physicochemical properties (Khadim et al., 2019; Lamb & Brown, 2001; Viscarra
    Rossel & McBratney, 1998). Regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and precision
    farming are overarching tools to attain sustainable goals of food production.
    These tools combined with AI and ML techniques can allow growers and scientists
    to maximize food production with minimum utilization of available resources (Table
    1). Permaculture is associated with a paradigm shift, seeking to offer partial
    solutions for the many problems of contemporary agriculture like soil degradation
    and loss of habitat, which undermines their future capacities to produce food.
    There is no one size that fits all scenario when adapting permaculture practices
    but expected benefits are still homogenous such as a reduction in chemical use
    and increased input of organic C and N to soils (Dı́az-Zorita et al., 2002). However,
    despite many successes permaculture adoption appears to have fallen short. This
    is primarily due to variations in permaculture practices as dictated by local
    conditions and its predominant goal of focusing on local community-oriented interactions.
    The lack of supporting contemporary scientific research and experimental applications
    further reduces its adoption. There have been debates on whether permaculture
    can truly feed a growing population and questions remain as to what extent it
    outperforms intensive farming system sustainably (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Its scientific
    foundation, applicability, and scalability to large land area have also been criticized
    (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Ingram (2018) describes the confusion as a mere lack of
    good evidence and intellectual rigor. The key question to answer here is whether
    permaculture can contribute broadly to agronomic yields and food security and
    performs in such ways as to benefit the wider agricultural communities. The key
    to answering this question is in the relative distributions of the population
    between rural and urban areas. These agricultural methods may not be suited for
    the input resource-intensive modern agriculture of temperate regions of North
    America, Europe, and Asia. However, for many rural communities, for example in
    Africa and South Asia where farming is an economic livelihood, permaculture is
    an important food supply function enabling local residents to meet their dietary
    needs with local culture and culinary traditions (Ferreira et al., 2018). 8 CONCLUSION
    The challenge of sustainably meeting increased food and energy demands is omnipresent.
    Specialized crop production and agricultural intensification have satisfied those
    demands for several years; however, the future of sustainable agricultural production,
    environmental footprint, and global food security is questionable. In confronting
    the challenges of achieving sustainable food security, the agricultural sector
    must focus on not only one, but a variety of strategies to be successful and agriculture
    can become a part of the solution. A multidimensional approach is necessary. Monocropping
    production systems with innovative technologies are not going away. These systems
    will continue to benefit the wider global society through massive increases in
    crop yields and food productivity. However, such successes are not sustainable
    and will continue to come at great expense to the environment. Adoption and progress
    towards regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and modern agricultural technologies
    (Figure 2) have been successful because these systems are flexible, diverse, and
    tailored to both large-scale production systems as well as local farmers and communities.
    In addition, permaculture and regenerative agriculture promote natural ecosystems
    (e.g., land) as multi-functional and emphasizes self-sufficient and self-regulating.
    Beyond embracing varied agronomic production systems, it will be important to
    have a focus on the root causes such as land degradation and climate change. We
    have demonstrated that practices such as permaculture and regenerative agriculture
    should be infused with an integrated approach of modern agricultural technology
    as well as utilization of data sciences such as AI and ML to provide a wide range
    of beneficial input services. These will, in turn aid in achieving sustainable
    food security because in many ways their ethos is on lowering production inputs
    as well as reduce environmental footprint. The unifying premises of permaculture
    and regenerative AI, agroecosystems are taking a holistic approach rather than
    focusing on just individual parts. It helps to explore how the various systems
    and their interactions can fetch overall system benefits. These approaches should
    be seen as parts of a wide range of measures, matrices, and efforts to intuitively
    approach sustainable food security goals. For permaculture practices, scientific
    data quantifying its effect and role in a future agriculture is needed and will
    be critical to promote its adoption. Further, a more robust and holistic research
    direction is necessary to integrate all these aspects of food production for overall
    socio-economic upliftment and farm productivity while managing our mother nature
    under the events of extreme weather events and climate change. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    Get rights and content Highlights • Wheat yield in Mexico is projected to decline
    with future climate change. • Elevated CO2 yield impact will not overcome negative
    impacts from warming. • Rainfed wheat yields could decline by up to 32% due to
    changes in rainfall. • Adaptation strategies, mainly to increasing temperatures
    will be needed in Mexico. Abstract Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops
    in Mexico, but the impact of future climate change on production is not known.
    To quantify the impact of future climate change together with its uncertainty,
    two wheat crop models were executed in parallel, using two scaling methods, five
    Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two main Representative Concentration Pathways
    (RCPs) for the 2050s. Simulated outputs varied among crop models, scaling methods,
    GCMs, and RCPs; however, they all projected a general decline in wheat yields
    by the 2050s. Despite the growth-stimulating effect of elevated CO2 concentrations,
    consistent yield declines were simulated across most of the main wheat growing
    regions of Mexico due to the projected increase in temperature. Exceptions occurred
    in some cooler areas, where temperature improved sub-optimal conditions, and in
    a few areas where rainfall increased, but these increases only provided negligible
    contributions to national production. Larger and more variable yield declines
    were projected for rainfed wheat due to current and projected spatial variability
    of temperature and rainfall patterns. Rainfed wheat, however, only contributes
    about 6% of Mexico’s wheat production. When aggregating the simulated climate
    change impacts, considering temperature increase, rainfall change, and elevated
    atmospheric CO2 concentrations for irrigated and rainfed wheat cropping systems,
    national wheat production for Mexico is projected to decline between 6.9% for
    RCP 4.5 and 7.9% for RCP 8.5. Model uncertainty (combined for crop and climate
    models) in simulated yield changes, and across two scaling methods, was smaller
    than temporal and spatial variability in both RCPs. Spatial variability tends
    to be the largest in both future scenarios. To maintain or increase future wheat
    production in Mexico, adaptation strategies, particularly to increasing temperatures
    affecting irrigated wheat, or expanding the cropping area, will be necessary.

    simulation modelUncertainty 1. Introduction Wheat is one of the major cereal crops
    in the world because of its importance as a main source of energy and protein
    in human diets (Curtis et al., 2002). In Mexico, wheat is among the top five produced
    crops: national production during the 2015–2016 season was 3.8 million tons (around
    $750 million value), cultivated on 720,000 ha (SAGARPA, 2016b). Production is
    concentrated in Sonora, Baja California, Sinaloa, Guanajuato, and Michoacán states,
    which together represent about 86% of the total national production (SAGARPA,
    2016a). More than 90% of the produced wheat is irrigated due to the arid and semi-arid
    climate in most of the wheat production area. Rainfed wheat production is typical
    of the high elevation areas in the central and southern states and Mediterranean-type
    climate in Baja California, where winter and spring temperature and rainfall are
    more suitable for the cropping system (Escobar, 2014). Past global temperature
    trends already show the effects of warming temperatures on wheat production. Historical
    wheat yield analysis showed a 5.5% global decline in aggregated wheat production
    since 1980, as a result of increased global mean temperature (Lobell et al., 2011).
    In Mexico, Asseng et al. (2014) reported warming decadal trends in Obregon (Sonora)
    and Toluca (Mexico State) of 0.46 and 0.27 °C, respectively, which have caused
    wheat yield declines from 2 to 3% per decade for the period from 1980 to 2010.
    However, Lobell et al. (2005) reported that wheat yields in Northwest Mexico have
    increased by 25% from 1980 to 2001, mostly due to cooling trends in night minimum
    temperature likely causing reduced plant respiration. Global temperature trends
    in the future suggest continuous warming by up to 2 °C at mid-century (IPCC, 2013),
    which may result in further wheat yield decline if no adaptation strategies are
    applied (Asseng et al., 2014; Challinor et al., 2014). Elevated atmospheric CO2
    in the future can have a positive effect on crop growth and yields but its response
    is limited to temperature, nitrogen (N), and water conditions (Alexandrov and
    Hoogenboom, 2000; Kimball et al., 2001). Climate change projections for Mexico
    differ in severity, but all of them report a warmer and drier climate by mid-century
    (Conde et al., 2011; Karmalkar et al., 2011; Peterson et al., 2002; SAGARPA and
    FAO, 2012), increasing the concern over how climate change will further affect
    wheat production. Few studies on the effects of climate change on Mexico’s wheat
    production were conducted in the past. SAGARPA and FAO (2012) conducted a study
    to determine the effects of climate change on Mexican wheat production by using
    one General Climate Model (GCM). Results showed average yield declines in the
    Northwest by up to 75%, but also projected 50% yield increases in Baja California
    and North Sonora. Another study conducted by Parry et al. (2004) also using one
    GCM with multiple emission scenarios and yield transfer functions, projected a
    5–10% yield decline in national production, even when considering adaptation strategies.
    The use of one GCM and one method to estimate impact yields limits these studies
    and increases uncertainty, as climate and crop model responses tend to vary widely
    (Giorgi and Francisco, 2000). In addition, the use of many GCMs is a common practice
    nowadays when conducting climate change assessments (Semenov and Stratonovitch,
    2010). Climate and crop simulation models contain errors due to their structure
    and parameterization, which cause uncertainty in projections (Asseng et al., 2013a;
    Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007). This uncertainty can be quantified through the use
    of multi-model ensembles (Asseng et al., 2013a; Martre et al., 2015; Wallach et
    al., 2016). Using the median or mean of multi-model ensembles has proven to be
    closer to observations than a single model in a diverse range of crops and environments
    (Asseng et al., 2013a; Martre et al., 2015; Palosuo et al., 2011; Rotter et al.,
    2012; Yin et al., 2017). The use of multi-model ensembles and different simulation
    methods provides a better understanding of the range of future climate change
    impacts on crop production and gives more confidence for building adaptation strategies
    for future decades (Asseng et al., 2013a; Dale et al., 2017). The main goal of
    this study was to explore the future impacts of climate change and its uncertainty
    on Mexican wheat production by using multiple climate and crop model and two scaling
    approaches. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Simulation methods The study was conducted
    using point and spatial simulation methods. Observed five year average (2010–2014)
    production and yield levels for wheat in Mexico (SAGARPA, 2016a) were used to
    select 32 reference locations for the point simulation method. Locations were
    selected capturing the diverse yield levels and environmental conditions for irrigated
    and rainfed wheat (Table 1, Fig. 1). Most reference locations are within the Northwestern
    states, where the majority of wheat production occurs. Major environmental characteristics
    for reference locations are provided in Table 1. An additional spatial simulation
    method was also conducted by using the MINK system, which is a is a global-scale
    gridded simulation platform (Robertson, 2017), using the same crop and climate
    models from the point simulations. Simulations were performed using 0.5° resolution
    considering the 2015 wheat production areas (SAGARPA, 2016a). Crop simulation
    models, input data for climate, crop management, soil profiles, planting dates,
    and cultivar selection and distribution were the same for both simulation methods.

    Crop simulation models The CROPSIM and NWheat crop simulation models embedded
    within the platform of the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer,
    DSSAT v4.6 (Jones et al., 2003) were selected to conduct the study. Both models
    simulate the crop’s life cycle based on Zadok’s scheme (Asseng et al., 2013b;
    Hunt and Pararajasingham, 1995; Zadoks et al., 1974). CROPSIM temperature responses
    are structured in cardinal temperature functions that control crop growth and
    development, and organic matter mineralization (Hunt and Pararajasingham, 1995).
    The NWheat model was derived from ASPSIM-NWheat (Asseng, 2004; Asseng et al.,
    1998, 2004; Kassie et al., 2016). Temperature in NWheat affects phenology, biomass
    accumulation, CO2 assimilation, leaf senescence during grain filling, rate of
    grain filling, and N demand to grain and vapor pressure deficit (Zheng et al.,
    2015). Both models run on a daily time step using the radiation use efficiency
    approach for crop biomass accumulation, and have been widely used to study cropping
    systems under different environments (Asseng et al., 2004; Asseng and Turner,
    2007; Asseng et al., 2002, 2000; Lazzaretti et al., 2015; Ruane et al., 2016;
    van Bussel et al., 2016; Van Ittersum et al., 2003). 2.2.2. Observed data Observed
    annual wheat yield, production, and planted area at state and district level for
    the baseline period (1980–2010) were collected from SAGARPA (2016a) to compare
    with the simulated wheat yields. Grain yield data was corrected to 0% moisture.
    In addition, wheat yields showed a positive linear trend through the baseline
    period, likely due to improvement in cultivar genetics and cultural practices.
    Therefore, wheat yields were detrended by using the following formula: Adjusted
    yield = y + m*(LY-CY) Where: y = yield for the current year m = slope from the
    linear regression in baseline wheat yield LY = last year from the baseline period
    CY = current year to be adjusted Phenology and yield related variables from a
    6-year experiment conducted in Obregon, Sonora (Sayre et al., 1997) were collected
    to compare phenology and yield variables with the simulated data. 2.2.3. Climate
    data The years 1980 to 2010 were selected as the historical baseline to compare
    with future climate change impacts on wheat production. This climate period was
    selected following the procedures of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and
    Improvement Project (AgMIP) and it is considered a sufficient period to allow
    climatological analysis (Guttman, 1989; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; WMO, 1989). Climate
    data for the reference locations were collected from available gridded climate
    datasets within the MINK system (Robertson, 2017). The baseline and future climate
    data for each reference location were extracted from the grid cell where the reference
    point coordinates were located (Table 1). Daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin)
    temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation in the MINK system were collected from
    National Centers for Environmental Prediction and University Corporation for Atmospheric
    Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis database (Kalnay et al., 1996). The spatial resolution
    of the NCEP data for Tmax and Tmin was about 1.884 °N/S and 1.865 °E/W. Rainfall
    data at 0.5° resolution corresponding to the same time period was collected from
    the Global Precipitation Climatological Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (GPCC NOAA, US). For the future scenarios, Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 were selected for mid-century (2050s) impact assessment.
    The RCPs are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories for future climate adopted
    by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013). Five downscaled
    and bias-corrected GCM scenarios (Table 2) from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model
    Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, revised version from November 2015) were collected
    from the Potsdam Climate Institute (Mueller and Robertson, 2014). Daily temperature
    and rainfall values were extracted and averaged into monthly averages for the
    baseline period (1980 to 2010) and the 2050s future period (2041–2070). Calculated
    monthly changes were applied to the daily climate of the historical weather data
    (baseline) to create future scenarios. The resulting daily value of temperature
    is the old daily value plus the calculated change between the future monthly value
    from the GCMs and the historical monthly value; daily rainfall values were handled
    using the same procedure. Solar radiation remained unchanged for the future scenarios.

    NorESM1-M 2.2.4. Atmospheric CO2 The atmospheric CO2 level for the historical
    baseline (baseline level) was set to 362 ppm, corresponding to the 30-year mean
    of the baseline period (1980–2010). Crop simulations for future scenarios were
    conducted with the projected elevated atmospheric CO2 to determine the combined
    effect of temperature, rainfall, and elevated CO2. The atmospheric CO2 levels
    for future scenarios (RCP 4.5 = 498 ppm, RCP 8.5 = 572 ppm) were based on the
    IPCC’s latest report (IPCC, 2013). Additionally, crop simulations for the future
    scenarios were conducted using the baseline level of atmospheric CO2 to estimate
    the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on wheat yield. 2.2.5. Soil data and initial
    conditions Soil characteristics for each location are described in the Table 1.
    The soil information corresponds to the geo-referenced HC27 generic soil profile
    database at 0.083° resolution created by Koo and Dimes (2010). The HC27 global
    soil distribution map was derived from the combination of three major texture
    types (clay, loam, sand), organic carbon levels (high, medium, low), and depths
    (shallow, medium, deep). Most of the soils in the reference locations for Mexico
    are within the category of loamy and clay soils, with variable organic carbon
    content and depth (Table 1). Initial surface residue was set to 3000 kg ha−1,
    initial root mass was set to 1000 kg ha−1, and initial mineral soil nitrogen (N)
    was set to 25 kg ha−1 (Gbegbelegbe et al., 2017). To ensure germination, and due
    to lack of initial water content observations, initial water content in the point
    simulations was set to 100% field capacity (FC) in the first 30 cm of the soil
    profile and at 10% FC for the rest of the soil profile. Point simulations were
    initialized one day before planting every year. 2.2.6. Crop management Sowing
    dates were selected using observed data (Sayre et al., 1997) and expert knowledge.
    Selected sowing dates were December 10th for the winter and July 1st for the summer
    season. All irrigated wheat simulations were sown in winter, and most rainfed
    wheat simulations were sown in summer, except for in the Northwest (Baja California,
    Baja California Sur, Sonora, Chihuahua, and Sinaloa), where winter sowing was
    more suitable in terms of temperature and rainfall. Plant density was 300 plants
    per m−2 at a 5 cm planting depth. Initially, N fertilizer applications were based
    on Ramirez-Rodrigues et al., (2016) and Sayre et al., (1997), but adjusted to
    observed state wheat yield levels from SAGARPA (2016a). The N fertilizer rates
    for the irrigated wheat point simulations ranged from 90 to 140 kg ha-1, and are
    presented in Fig. 1. For the gridded simulations, the N fertilizer distribution
    was divided by states, using the same amount as the reference point located in
    a particular state. The N application rate for rainfed wheat in all reference
    locations and in spatial simulations was 10 kg ha-1, following the recommendations
    from Limon-Ortega and Villaseñor-Mir (2006). N fertilizer in irrigated wheat was
    split equally in two applications: one at sowing and the other at 40 days after
    sowing. In the case of rainfed wheat, a single application was performed at sowing.
    The fertilizer was applied as urea-N banded beneath the surface and incorporated
    at 5 cm. Water management for the irrigated treatment was set to automatic irrigation
    at 80% of maximum water available in the first 30 cm of the soil profile to reduce
    the risk of crop water stress. 2.2.7. Cultivar selection, distribution, and genetic
    coefficients Cultivar selection was site-specific (Table 1). Wheat cultivars were
    selected according to the mega-environment distribution designed by CIMMYT, which
    assigns a cultivar type (spring, facultative, or winter) depending on growing
    conditions and disease pressures (Monfreda et al., 2008). Cultivar genetic coefficients
    from the CERES-Wheat simulation model were first extracted from Gbegbelegbe et
    al., (2017). The genetic coefficients were revised based on observed phenology
    and yields from the Obregon, Sonora experiment and state yield data from major
    production areas (SAGARPA, 2016a; Sayre et al., 1997). Revised coefficients were

    depending on their definition and units. The updated set of cultivar genetic coefficients
    relevant for Mexico are shown in Table 3. Most of the selected cultivars were

    model was previously tested with detailed field experiment data from Obregon,
    Sonora (Asseng et al., 2004), which is one of the most important wheat producing
    areas in Mexico. In addition, observed state level yield data for the baseline
    (1980–2010) (SAGARPA, 2016a) from major production areas in Sonora, Baja California,
    Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon, and Zacatecas were selected to compare simulated vs observed
    yields. Crop model performance was quantified by calculating the root mean square
    error per location over the 30-year baseline period for irrigated and rainfed
    wheat production. Correlation coefficients for combined irrigated and rainfed
    wheat yields at 95% confidence interval for the baseline period for the three
    major producing states were calculated from observations vs the simulated wheat
    yields. Individual correlation coefficients by state were also calculated. 2.4.
    Procedure to upscale the climate change impacts to observed wheat yields Observed
    district irrigated and rainfed 2015 wheat production statistics in Mexico from
    SAGARPA (2016a) were used for the procedure. Each of the 32 simulated locations
    were assigned to a district and its wheat production, depending on proximity and
    yield level. Delta changes for each location were calculated by finding the percentage
    change of the RCP output versus the baseline period. Delta changes were then applied
    to the observed 2015 district wheat production. Future irrigated and rainfed wheat
    production were summed up to report an aggregated national production for the
    2050s future period. For the spatial simulation method, raster files corresponding
    to each mega-environment cultivar, nitrogen level, sowing dates, GCMs, and crop
    models were combined in one single national raster for each RCP, keeping separated
    irrigated and rainfed simulations. Then, the baseline and future national wheat
    production was obtained by summing up all the wheat production by grid cell for
    the baseline and each RCP. Delta change of the RCPs relative to baseline period
    was then calculated by difference between RCP and baseline period. 2.5. Model
    uncertainty Combined model uncertainty from the GCMs and crop simulation models
    from the point simulations was calculated and expressed as the 10th and 90th percentiles
    of the average of the 30 years for the 32 reference locations. Whereas for the
    spatial simulations, the 30-year average changes were calculated for each grid
    cell, and combined crop and GCM model uncertainty was calculated by taking the
    10th and 90th percentiles of the grid cell value distribution. 3. Results 3.1.
    Climate Temperature and rainfall for the baseline (1980–2010) showed spatial variation
    during winter and summer, with summer showing warmer temperatures and higher rainfall
    for most locations. The average temperature during the winter was 14.3 °C with
    seasonal rainfall averaging 61 mm (Table 1). Winter rainfall in the Northern area
    of Baja California was the highest, due to its Mediterranean-type climate, averaging
    200 mm. The summer season was warmer with a 23.0 °C average temperature, and rainfall
    averaged 315 mm during the season (Table 1). Climate change scenarios show different
    magnitudes of temperature and rainfall changes for the 2050s in Mexico. However,
    all GCMs and both RCPs projected warmer temperatures with a steeper warming trend
    during the summer (Fig. 2). Maximum temperature (Tmax) in both seasons tends to
    increase faster than the minimum temperature (Tmin) (Fig. 2), which is the opposite
    to the global temperature trend (Solomon et al., 2007). Projected average warming
    during the winter for RCP 4.5 was 2.4 °C for Tmax and 1.0 °C for Tmin. For RCP
    8.5, the temperature increase was higher, averaging 2.9 °C for Tmax and 1.6 °C
    for Tmin (Fig. 2a, b). Winter warming was higher in cooler locations in the north
    than in the southern states (data not shown). Summer temperatures were projected
    to increase by 2.0 °C for Tmax and 1.9 °C for Tmin for RCP 4.5, and by 2.7 °C
    and 2.6 °C for Tmax and Tmin, respectively, for RCP 8.5 (Fig. 2c, d). Rainfall
    projections showed large variability, with winter rainfall projected to decline
    by an average of 12.5% and 17.5% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively (Fig. 3a, b).
    Whereas summer rainfall projections ranged from a 5.9% increase to a 19.7% decrease,
    with similar variability under RCP 8.5 (Fig. 3c, d). Download : Download high-res

    Model performance Root mean square error (RMSE) for irrigated wheat was between
    348 and 485 kg ha−1 and between 542 and 909 kg ha−1 for rainfed wheat (Fig. 4).
    Rainfed wheat showed higher RMSE, mostly caused by the model sensitivity to initial
    water conditions. Correlation coefficient for combined irrigated and rainfed wheat
    was highly significant (P < 0.01) with an r2 > 0.9. Correlation coefficient for
    combined irrigated and rainfed wheat for the three major wheat producing states
    for irrigated and rainfed wheat was highly significant (P < 0.01) with an r2 > 0.90.
    However, when conducting the individual analysis by state, correlations were low.
    Individual correlation coefficients for the major production states for irrigated
    wheat ranged between 0.2 and 0.03 while rainfed wheat showed even smaller coefficients,
    which were often not significant. Observed data used for this analysis was reported
    farmer data summarized per state, which combines a wide range of crop production
    practices (e.g. change between years and within a region in irrigation, fertilizer,
    sowing dates, cultivars, pest and disease, etc.) and yield levels across the state,
    while the simulated yields were point specific. Therefore, differences between
    simulated versus observed yield data are expected, causing a low correlation.
    The RMSE showed reasonable results indicating that the models represent the observed
    yield levels. Download : Download high-res image (471KB) Download : Download full-size

    impact on Mexico wheat phenology and yields 3.3.1. Phenology Simulated climate
    change impacts resulted in accelerated wheat phenology, with earlier flowering
    and a reduced grain filling period (time from anthesis to physiological maturity),
    during both seasons, as result of the warming temperatures under future scenarios
    (Fig. 2). The winter anthesis date for the baseline was in mid-March and was 6
    days earlier for RCP 4.5 and 8 days earlier for RCP 8.5. The grain filling period
    was also affected, decreasing from 44 days in the baseline to 42 days under both
    RCPs. The anthesis date for summer-sown wheat was in early September for the baseline,
    but it was 4 days earlier for RCP 4.5 and 5 days earlier for RCP 8.5. The grain
    filling period for summer sown wheat was 5 and 7 days shorter in RCP 4.5 and 8.5,
    respectively. 3.3.2. Grain yields Irrigated and rainfed wheat simulations suggest
    yield declines for most locations in Mexico by the 2050s due to projected warmer
    temperatures and decreased rainfall, despite the alleviating effect of CO2. Fig.
    5 shows relative yield change by GCM for irrigated and rainfed wheat for the 2050s
    in Mexico. Simulated irrigated wheat shows consistent yield declines for all GCMs
    in both RCPs with more pronounced declines for RCP 8.5. GFDL was the most optimistic
    GCM in both RCPs, as it projected the lowest temperature warming (Fig. 2). The
    highest temperature increase was projected in HadGEM2 for both RCPs, which resulted
    in the most pessimistic yield declines (Fig. 5a). Simulated rainfed wheat yield
    impacts are highly variable due to the combined effect of projected temperature
    and rainfall changes, suggesting mostly negative impacts, but ranging from a 44.3%
    yield increase to a 54.7% yield decrease for RCP 4.5 (Fig. 5b). Similar variability
    was observed in RCP 8.5, though simulated impacts tended to be ameliorated by
    the alleviating effect of elevated CO2 (Fig. 5b). Both crop simulation models
    captured similar responses to climate change by the 2050s (Fig. 6a). CROPSIM was
    more optimistic, projecting, in average, a negative climate change impact of <−2.1%
    in irrigated wheat yields for both RCPs. Whereas the NWheat model showed irrigated
    wheat yield declines for all locations, averaging -7.3% in RCP 4.5 and −8.3% in
    RCP 8.5 (Fig. 6a). With regards to simulated changes in rainfed wheat yields,
    both crop simulation models agreed, showing mostly negative impacts with large
    spatial variability, due to large variability in future climate scenarios (Fig.
    6b). When averaging both models, climate change resulted in consistent negative
    impacts for irrigated and rainfed wheat production by the 2050s (Fig. 6a). Download

    effects on wheat growth and yields by 2050, with NWheat showing more pessimistic
    impacts for both RCPs (Fig. 7a). In average, the crop models suggested negative
    yield effects on irrigated wheat as temperatures increased, showing -10.4% and
    -13.4% yield declines for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively (Fig. 7a). Average
    temperature impacts showed consistent irrigated wheat yield declines that are
    similar to reported observations from Ottman et al., (2012). Download : Download

    and 90th percentile of the average of 30 years and five GCMs (Table 2) for the
    32 representative locations (Table 1). Future temperature effect corresponds to
    the simulated yield change for baseline atmospheric CO2 concentration (362 ppm).
    Observations are based on measured temperature impacts for same background temperature
    and projected temperature change, derived from Ottman et al., (2012). Mean baseline
    temperature (winter = 15.1 °C, summer = 21.1 °C) and projected mean temperature
    change for RCP 4.5 (winter= + 1.8 °C, summer= + 1.6 °C) and RCP 8.5 (winter= + 2.4 °C,
    summer= + 2.3 °C) for Mexico. With regards to rainfed wheat, temperature and water
    stress impacts were larger and more variable due to already warm temperatures
    during summer, but also due to the added effect of spatial rainfall variability.
    The crop models tended to be more conservative when simulating the temperature
    impact on rainfed yields as compared to observations from Ottman et al., (2012),
    considering that future simulated rainfed yields also accounted for changes in
    rainfall. Simulations and observations show larger wheat yield declines per degree
    of temperature increase in already warm environments than in the cooler ones (Fig.
    7). In terms of CO2 response, both models simulated on average positive CO2 response
    for irrigated wheat yields in Mexico by the 2050s. Simulated irrigated wheat CO2
    response averaged 5.7% in RCP 4.5 and 8.0% in RCP 8.5, which is within the ranges
    reported in literature (Fig. 8a). The CO2 response in rainfed wheat was lower,
    averaging 4.2 and 6.4% in RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The CO2 response functions
    in both crop models are similar: The CROPSIM model simulates CO2 response as a
    linear response, with positive biomass growth stimulus as atmospheric CO2 increases
    above 330 ppm (base atmospheric CO2 level), reaching the maximum response (43%)
    at 990 ppm atmospheric CO2. With regards to NWheat, the CO2 response is also linked
    to temperature, thus CO2 response further increases with higher temperature to
    a maximum of 18 °C mean temperature, resulting in slightly higher CO2 response
    than the CROPISM model (Asseng et al., 2004). Research also suggests that CO2
    effects can be larger under limited water, but high N supply (Fig. 8b). While
    CO2 response tends to be mostly positive, few locations showed negative yield
    changes due to N stress limiting the positive effects of the CO2. Download : Download

    top to bottom, the 10th percentile, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and
    90th percentile of the average of 30 years and five GCMs (Table 2) for the 32
    locations (Table 1). Future CO2 effect corresponds the difference between elevated
    atmospheric CO2 concentration (RCP 4.5 = 498 ppm and RCP 8.5 = 572 ppm) vs baseline
    CO2 (362 ppm). Observations were derived from measurements in field experiments
    with elevated atmospheric CO2 adjusted to projected CO2 concentrations, based
    on O’Leary et al. (2015) (circles), Kimball et al. (2001) (triangles) and Kimball
    et al. (1995) (squares). Fig. 9 shows simulated irrigated and rainfed wheat yield
    changes by location for 2050. Simulated climate change impacts tend to be more
    consistent for irrigated wheat yields, while climate change impacts on rainfed
    yields were highly variable mostly due to rainfall spatial variability across
    Mexico. Irrigated wheat yields are suggested to decline up to -13% under RCP 4.5,
    except for North Zacatecas, where the warmer temperatures and elevated CO2 improve
    suboptimal growing conditions. Locations in North Coahuila show the most negative
    impact of climate change due to already warm conditions during grain filling caused
    by late anthesis compared to the rest of the locations (data not shown). For RCP
    8.5, simulated irrigated wheat yield changes tend to be more pessimistic with
    the majority of locations showing yield declines except for North Zacatecas, yet
    the positive effect there is still lower than for RCP 4.5 (Fig. 9a, b). The Northwestern
    states, where more than 75% of the irrigated wheat is currently grown are suggested
    to be one of the most affected regions in Mexico, as projected warming trends
    in this region are higher than in the southern states (Fig. 9a, b). Climate change
    impacts on rainfed wheat yields were larger showing mostly yield declines. However,
    important rainfed producing locations in Zacatecas, Michoacán, Oaxaca, and Chiapas
    show positive yield changes as a result of the improvement of suboptimal conditions
    either for temperature, rainfall or both but also due to the future elevated CO2.
    The most negative impacts were observed in the Northwest, but rainfed production
    in this area is negligible. Yield declines tended to be higher for RCP 8.5 due
    to warmer temperature and a drier climate under this emission scenario. Spatial
    simulation method resulted in similar results of climate changes impacts on irrigated
    and rainfed wheat yields, showing similar variabilities between both methods;
    however, spatial simulations indicated slightly more negative impact than the
    point simulations (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (457KB) Download

    system (Robertson, 2017). When weighting simulated wheat yield changes to observed
    district production and averaging for both methods, climate change impacts suggest
    a decline in aggregated (irrigated + rainfed) wheat production by 2050, with RCP
    4.5 showing a yield impact of -5.0% and RCP 8.5 an impact of -5.9% (Fig. 11).
    Year to year variability is considerably smaller than spatial variability due
    to regional climate differences across Mexico. Model uncertainty tends to be large,
    mostly as result of the different magnitudes of climate change impacts captured
    by the crop simulation models, ranging from -0.7 to -13.6% for RCP 4.5 and from
    2.2 to -15.4% for RCP 8.5. Upscaled climate change impact for the spatial simulation
    method showed slightly more negative impacts, with -8.9% for RCP 4.5 and -9.9%
    for RCP 8.5. Grid cell variability was larger than model uncertainty, as observed
    in the point simulations. However, model uncertainty for the spatial simulations
    was smaller than the point simulations. Download : Download high-res image (187KB)

    allowed us to explore the effects of climate change on wheat yields by the 2050s,
    indicating negative climate change impacts on wheat production in Mexico. While
    previous studies in Mexico have attempted to determine the effects of climate
    change using either a limited number of GCMs and/or crop models or just exploring
    the sole effect of warming temperatures on wheat yields, in this study we explored
    the combined future effects of temperature, rainfall changes, and elevated CO2
    on wheat production using 5 GCMs and two-model ensembles with two scaling methods
    and quantified uncertainties. Spatial variability was larger than temporal variability,
    with most locations projecting yield declines, especially due to warming temperatures,
    and despite the alleviating effect of elevated atmospheric CO2. Uncertainties
    were large, mostly as a result of structural differences in the crop simulation
    models, though when using the average of the two models, simulated yield responses
    were closer to observations than when comparing to a single model, like in previous
    studies (Asseng et al., 2014; Martre et al., 2015; Palosuo et al., 2011). Previous
    studies also showed a wide range of climate responses, partly due to the use of
    a single GCM to conduct the studies and crop model assumptions and methods. Simulated
    climate change effects in our study show more conservative yield declines to the
    ones reported by SAGARPA and FAO (2012), who used one GCM (MIROC 3.2-HIRES) using
    one climate change scenario, A1B (IPCC, 2007), and a Ricardian method (Gbetibouo
    and Hassan, 2005; Mendelsohn and Dinar, 1999) to quantify yield changes in the
    future for the 2050s. Results from SAGARPA and FAO (2012) showed yield declines
    for South Sonora, South Baja California, and North Sinaloa ranging from 25 to
    75% as result of changes in temperature and precipitation. By contrast, they reported
    yield increases in Baja California and North Sonora by up to 50%. Our results
    are very different to SAGARPA and FAO (2012), but more similar to the ones reported
    by Parry et al. (2004), who used the climate change SRES scenarios from the IPCC
    (2001) report (IPCC, 2001) and yield transfer functions to estimate yield impacts.
    This particular study, however, was conducted using only one GCM (HadGEM3), where
    the projected temperature increase ranged from 1 to 2 °C and elevated CO2 ranged
    from 460 to 500 ppm for mid-century. Cereal yield decline at the national level
    ranged from 5 to 10%, even when applying adaptation strategies such as changes
    in sowing dates, fertilizer, and irrigation management. Climate change responses
    for the previously discussed studies showed large uncertainties, because GCMs
    tend to vary widely on climate projections, in addition to the uncertainty caused
    by using only one technique to estimate yield impacts. Warm temperatures cause
    accelerated plant phenology, shortening the growth cycle as degree days accumulate
    faster. Under warm temperatures, the number of spikelets and the number of kernels
    per spikelet decrease, resulting in reduced grain number (Johnson and Kanemasu,
    1983). Heat stress caused by temperatures above 32 °C after anthesis accelerate
    leaf senescence (Al-khatib and Paulsen, 1984), and the grain filling period tends
    to be shorter, limiting time for grain growth (Asseng et al., 2014). The crop
    simulation models used in the current study were able to capture the effects of
    temperature, simulating earlier anthesis, reduced grain filling period, and reduced
    yields under projected warmer temperatures. Our study suggests consistent irrigated
    wheat yield declines of 6.2% per degree temperature increase during the winter,
    which is within reported ranges. Rainfed wheat systems showed larger and more
    variable responses than irrigated systems, because of the combined effects of
    already warm baseline temperatures (Liu et al., 2016) and future rainfall declines,
    with projected yield reductions ranging from 5.0 to 7.0% per degree increase in
    temperature during the summer. Sayre et al. (1997) reported that increases by
    1.0 °C during the period from January to April in Sonora, Mexico resulted in anthesis
    occurring 11 days earlier, and the grain filling period being shortened by 3 days,
    which is similar to our simulated phenology; grain yields declined by 8.5% on
    average over the 6-year studied period. Asseng et al. (2014) reported a 6% yield
    decline per degree of global warming, but also found that simulated yield losses
    were larger in already warm regions. Lobell et al. (2011) reported a 5.5% yield
    decline per degree of global warming using statistical methods. In a recent study
    conducted in Sudan, which is a temperature hotspot location, yield decline per
    degree of warming was estimated at 5.9% for a 13 °C baseline temperature, yield
    declines are much higher in locations where temperatures reached 27 °C (Asseng
    et al., 2017). O’Leary et al., 2015showed that irrigated wheat yield declined
    as temperature increased and that temperature impacts were larger at warmer temperatures
    than at cooler temperatures (Fig. 7). A similar trend was observed by Liu et al.
    (2016), who suggested that warmer locations in the world tended to have more negative
    effects as temperatures increased. By contrast, in another study, Lobell et al.
    (2005) suggested that yield increase over the period from 1980 to 2001 was mostly
    due to cooling trends in night temperatures benefiting plant growth. In our study,
    a few exceptions occurred where climate change improved suboptimal growing conditions.
    Simulated irrigated yields for North Zacatecas showed a positive yield response
    due to improvements on suboptimal temperature and CO2 conditions. In the case
    of rainfed wheat locations in the south with >500 mm precipitation, yields are
    actually benefited by small declines in rainfall, as the crop can take better
    advantage of the applied N due to less leaching occurring under the projected
    climate scenarios. Irrigated systems were simulated using automatic irrigation,
    therefore, water stress was minimal, although it has been reported that water
    stress effects tend to be more severe as temperature increases (Shah and Paulsen,
    2003). In the case of rainfed wheat, supplemental irrigation may be an option
    to reduce the negative effects of rainfall variability (Xiao et al., 2005), and
    as a result to decrease water stress and increase yields, which in turn may help
    to reduce future climate change effects. Differences in CO2 response were due
    to structural differences in how the models simulate the CO2 effects on biomass
    accumulation. However, crop models do well at reproducing FACE experiment data,
    which gives us confidence in our results (Asseng et al., 2014, 2004; O’Leary et
    al., 2015). Crop model response to CO2 is also related to N availability. CO2
    response is lower in the presence of N stress, suggesting that increased N fertilizer
    use may be an adaptation strategy to improve crop yields in the future, which
    has been suggested in previous studies (Kimball, 2016; Kimball et al., 2001).
    FACE experiments also show that under water stress, but high N supply, the CO2
    response tends to be even larger than under adequate growing conditions (Kimball
    et al., 2001, 1995). Despite the differences in model initialization and the simulation
    process per se (points vs spatial), both methods resulted in similar climate change
    impacts on wheat production by 2050. Liu et al. (2016) and Zhao et al. (2017)
    also showed that point and gridded simulation produce similar impacts in regional
    and global analysis for temperature impacts. 5. Limitations 5.1. Observed data
    Yield comparisons to the baseline yields were conducted using state yield level
    data from SAGARPA (2016a) and indicated that simulated yields were within the
    range of reported yield data. However, simulated yield dynamics in the baseline
    differed from the observed data. Differences were possibly caused, in part, by
    different grower practices. In addition, generalizations in crop management practices
    and crop genetic coefficients may have introduced uncertainty to the simulated
    wheat yields, adding to the differences in simulated yields. 5.2. Crop management
    Irrigated wheat simulations were conducted using one representative planting date
    for all reference locations, while two planting dates were used for rainfed areas.
    In reality, however, the planting window for the winter cycle is between mid-November
    to mid-December, and in locations like Sinaloa and Nuevo Leon the planting time
    window extends till the end of December. For rainfed wheat in the central region,
    the planting window is between mid-May and mid-June, when rainfall starts to occur.
    With regards to fertilizer applications, N fertilizer was set to be region-specific
    based on the observed state wheat yields for the baseline. But in reality, fertilizer
    practices are not standardized, possibly leading to uncertainties concerning the
    role that elevated atmospheric CO2 will play in the future, since crop response
    to elevated CO2 is linked to N availability. Large differences were also observed
    when comparing observed and simulated rainfed wheat yields, primarily resulting
    from crop model sensitivity to initial water conditions. Under the present study,
    initial water conditions were set to avoid crop losses due to water related germination
    restrictions built into the models. In reality, under rainfed circumstances water
    accumulated in the soil profile previous to planting plays an important role in
    heavy soils, where the stored water helps to maintain the crop early on the season,
    even when rainfall may be minimal during this period. 5.3. Crop genetic coefficients
    Crop genetic coefficients based on mega-environments were collected from Gbegbelegbe
    et al. (2017) and translated to the NWheat and CROPSIM model. Because calibration
    was carried with field data for the used cultivars, crop genetic coefficients
    may be adding to the uncertainty of the study. However, phenology for spring varieties,
    which were the most common type used, was compared to 6 years of observed data
    for spring cultivars and experts knowledge (Sayre et al., 1997), giving confidence
    in the used crop genetic coefficients. 5.4. Irrigation practices Irrigated wheat
    simulations were conducted by using automatic irrigation to avoid water stress
    during the season. As temperature increases, however, crop water stress effects
    tend to be more negative. Therefore, it is likely that if the crop is subjected
    to higher water stress in the future than it currently is, larger negative climate
    change impacts may be expected. 6. Conclusions Climate change impacts were quantified
    together with their uncertainties through the use of a crop-climate multimodel
    ensemble, an approach which provides a more comprehensive assessment than the
    ones conducted previously, where single models were used and lacked any quantification
    of uncertainty. Climate change poses a threat to one of the major cereal crops
    in Mexico with warming temperatures already causing yield declines in major production
    areas, such as Northwest Mexico. Climate change in the future is projected to
    exacerbate the effects of temperature, especially in the Northwest, regardless
    of the growth-stimulating effects of CO2. Adaptation strategies such as introducing
    heat tolerant cultivars, early vigor, and changes in phenology may be the most
    feasible way to cope with the negative effects of climate change, in particularly
    temperature increase. Change in crop management, such as early planting or N application
    rates may also offer additional benefits. Expanding wheat cropping could be an
    option in some regions, however, water availability for irrigation might be limited.
    Future water availability for even current wheat cropping area is already an issue,
    since many aquifers are over-used or have conditions of saline water intrusion
    (CNA, 2016; Curiel, 2013). An integrated assessment of climate change adaptation
    strategies should be conducted considering the sustainability of these practices
    in terms of feasibility and practicability. Implementing adaptation measures in
    the future could assist to maintain and improve wheat production for the coming
    decades in Mexico. Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge financial support

    \ more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced\ndata and technologies\
    \ than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes. The agriculture\n\
    industry is being advanced by various information and advanced communication technologies,\
    \ such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid emergence of these advanced\
    \ technologies has restructured\nalmost all other industries, as well as advanced\
    \ agriculture, which has shifted the industry from a\nstatistical approach to\
    \ a quantitative one. This radical change has shaken existing farming techniques\n\
    and produced the latest prospects in a series of challenges. This comprehensive\
    \ review article en-\nlightens the potential of the IoT in the advancement of\
    \ agriculture and the challenges faced when\ncombining these advanced technologies\
    \ with conventional agricultural systems. A brief analysis\nof these advanced\
    \ technologies with sensors is presented in advanced agricultural applications.\n\
    Numerous sensors that can be implemented for speciﬁc agricultural practices require\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (e.g., land preparation, irrigation systems, insect,\
    \ and disease management). This\nreview includes the integration of all suitable\
    \ techniques, from sowing to harvesting, packaging,\ntransportation, and advanced\
    \ technologies available for farmers throughout the cropping system.\nBesides,\
    \ this review article highlights the utilization of other tools such as unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) for crop monitoring and other beneﬁciary measures, such\
    \ as optimizing crop yields. In addi-\ntion, advanced programs based on the IoT\
    \ are also discussed. Finally, based on our comprehensive\nreview, we identiﬁed\
    \ advanced prospects regarding the IoT, which are essential tools for sustainable\n\
    agriculture.\nKeywords: IoT; agriculture advancement; UAVs; sustainable agriculture\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn order to increase agricultural production with limited resources,\
    \ major technological\nadvancements have been implemented throughout much of human\
    \ history. However, a\ngrowing population along with climate change always poses\
    \ a threat between food supply\nand demand. The world’s population is estimated\
    \ to reach 9 billion by 2050, which is\nabout a twenty-ﬁve percent increase over\
    \ the current population [1]. However, population\ngrowth will be larger, mostly\
    \ in emerging countries such as Mexico, India, China, and\nothers [2]. Additionally,\
    \ the urbanization trend is expected to accelerate in developing\ncountries by\
    \ 2050. Currently, 49% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, which\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13094883\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n2 of 31\nis expected to increase to 70% by 2050\
    \ [3]. Besides, since the living standard is expected\nto increase in the future,\
    \ it will further increase food demand, particularly in emerging\nnations. Due\
    \ to the continuous increase in the global population, we should be more\ncautious\
    \ regarding nutritional values and food quality. To meet future food demands,\n\
    food production should be doubled by 2050 [4,5]. In particular, grain crops and\
    \ meat\nproduction should be increased from 2.1 billion tons to 3 billion tons,\
    \ and 200 million tons\nto 470 million tons, respectively, to meet the world food\
    \ demand by 2050 [6,7].\nIndeed, crops such as rubber, cotton, and chewing gum\
    \ play a crucial role in various\ncountries’ economies. In addition, crop-based\
    \ bioenergy markets have recently begun to\ngrow. Even ten years ago, 110 million\
    \ tons of coarse grains (about 10% of world production)\nwere used for ethanol\
    \ production alone [7,8]. Food security is also threatened by the\nincreased use\
    \ of food crops for biofuel production, bioenergy, and other industrial uses.\n\
    These biofuel/bioenergy demands have put further pressure on already scarce agricultural\n\
    resources. Unfortunately, due to different constraints (e.g., temperature, terrain,\
    \ and soil\nand water qualities), only a limited part of the Earth’s surface is\
    \ appropriate for agricultural\nuse. Moreover, the existing farming land is further\
    \ narrowed because of economic and\npolitical factors, including population growth,\
    \ climate, and land-use patterns, while the\nrapid urbanization process is continuously\
    \ putting pressure on the availability of arable\nland. Thus, since arable land\
    \ is decreasing, these factors would be major threats to crop\nproduction. Additionally,\
    \ crop production is already reduced due to a lack of arable land\nover the last\
    \ few decades [8]. For example, in 1991, arable land for the crop production\n\
    was 19.5 million square miles, which was 39.47% of the total agricultural land\
    \ area, but\nthat area was decreased to 18.6 million square miles in 2013, which\
    \ is about 37.73% of\nthe total agricultural land area of the world and is expected\
    \ to decrease in the future [9].\nConsequently, a larger gap between the demand\
    \ and supply of food is observed, which\nbecomes apparent and shocking over time.\n\
    Further, the quality and quantity of crops rely on climate, topography, and soil\
    \ charac-\nteristics. Major features such as available nutrients, soil types,\
    \ soil health, insect resistance,\nand quality and quantity of irrigation determine\
    \ its adaptability and the quality of certain\ncrops. In most cases, crop characteristics\
    \ and yields may vary within the same farm plot.\nTherefore, site-speciﬁc analysis\
    \ or the precision farming technique is required to obtain\noptimal yields. Besides\
    \ increasing crop production, growers and farmers need to practice\nmultiple cropping,\
    \ mixed cropping, year-round cropping, or intensive cropping. To meet\nthese needs,\
    \ growers and farmers require the latest/advanced technologies and services-\n\
    based techniques to produce more foods with limited land and resources. Farmers/growers\n\
    must monitor their croplands at a near to real-time scale to apply necessary measures\
    \ to\nenhance crop production. For this reason, there is a need for smart agriculture.\n\
    Currently, farmers and growers have to spend 70% of their time monitoring and\n\
    understanding the status of the crops rather than performing actual farm work\
    \ [10]. Hence,\nprecise and advanced technologies are required to advance the\
    \ agricultural sector. Addi-\ntionally, for sustainable agriculture, the effects\
    \ of climatic and environmental conditions\nshould be minimal. The Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) gives producers better results because\nof “on-site monitoring”\
    \ capabilities, allowing them to monitor farms remotely. Wireless\nsensors help\
    \ to continuously monitor crops with greater accuracy, and most importantly,\n\
    they can identify issues at the early growth stages of crops/plants. The latest\
    \ technologies\nand tools enhance agricultural operations during the crop growth\
    \ stages, such as crop har-\nvesting, the transportation of cropping materials,\
    \ and storage conditions [10]. During these\ndevelopmental stages of crops, advanced\
    \ technology, such as the IoT, plays a signiﬁcant\nrole, making the process efﬁcient\
    \ for the growers. Currently, several tools, including har-\nvesters, robot weeders,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other automatic machines,\nare beneﬁcial\
    \ to the growers for crop monitoring. For this purpose, several sensors are\n\
    installed in the ﬁeld. These sensors rapidly provide information regarding soil\
    \ health and\ncrop health, and associated factors. The IoT is a part of the latest\
    \ agricultural technology,\nwhich helps collect data from the ﬁeld.\nSustainability\

    \ Advanced\ntechnologies, such as IoT sensors, wireless sensors, and UAVs, have\
    \ received exponentially\nincreasing attention from the scientiﬁc communities.\
    \ However, it is always challenging\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n5 of 31\n\
    for stakeholders and users to select and implement appropriate technology to improve\n\
    crop production. Recently, a few studies reviewed the IoT-based articles focusing\
    \ on\nimplementation, application, challenges, potential, and future prospective\
    \ of the IoT in\nsmart farming and agro-industry [24–26]. However, they mainly\
    \ focused on IoT-based\nstudies. We reviewed most of the important advanced technology-based\
    \ studies, which\nare essential for agriculture advancements either alone or in\
    \ combinations.\nOur strategy was to review advanced technology-based articles.\
    \ We selected the\narticles focusing on smart agriculture, precision agriculture,\
    \ drones/UAVs, wireless com-\nmunication technologies, the IoT, and smartphone\
    \ technologies applications in agriculture.\nWe also included articles focusing\
    \ on monitoring several agricultural components using\nIoT sensors and wireless\
    \ devices, such as monitoring soil moisture, vegetation health,\nplant diseases,\
    \ crop yield, climatic parameters, and few others. We included most of the\ntechnology-based\
    \ studies conducted in the last two decades that are helpful for agricultural\n\
    advancements.\n3. Major Agriculture Applications and Services\nAll the traditional\
    \ approaches have been changed and overlapped by advanced tech-\nnologies, such\
    \ as the IoT and UAVs. Currently, the implementation of various wireless\nsensors\

    \ been conducted to address critical issues in \nagriculture to improve agricultural\
    \ production for food security. With recent advance-\nments in technologies and\
    \ the potentials to enhance agricultural production using ad-\nvanced technologies,\
    \ several researchers put tremendous effort into advancing agricul-\nture. Advanced\
    \ technologies, such as IoT sensors, wireless sensors, and UAVs, have re-\nceived\
    \ exponentially increasing attention from the scientific communities. However,\
    \ it is \nalways challenging for stakeholders and users to select and implement\
    \ appropriate tech-\nnology to improve crop production. Recently, a few studies\
    \ reviewed the IoT-based arti-\ncles focusing on implementation, application,\
    \ challenges, potential, and future prospec-\ntive of the IoT in smart farming\
    \ and agro-industry [24–26]. However, they mainly focused \non IoT-based studies.\
    \ We reviewed most of the important advanced technology-based \nstudies, which\
    \ are essential for agriculture advancements either alone or in combinations.\
    \  \nOur strategy was to review advanced technology-based articles. We selected\
    \ the ar-\nticles focusing on smart agriculture, precision agriculture, drones/UAVs,\
    \ wireless com-\nmunication technologies, the IoT, and smartphone technologies\
    \ applications in agricul-\nture. We also included articles focusing on monitoring\
    \ several agricultural components \nusing IoT sensors and wireless devices, such\
    \ as monitoring soil moisture, vegetation \nhealth, plant diseases, crop yield,\
    \ climatic parameters, and few others. We included most \nof the technology-based\
    \ studies conducted in the last two decades that are helpful for \nagricultural\
    \ advancements.  \n3. Major Agriculture Applications and Services  \nAll the traditional\
    \ approaches have been changed and overlapped by advanced tech-\nnologies, such\
    \ as the IoT and UAVs. Currently, the implementation of various wireless \nsensors\
    \ and IoT sensors leads to the gateway of many innovations for crop improvement.\

    \ modiﬁed from Talavera\net al. [26].\n3.1. Soil Monitoring\nSoil plays a critical\
    \ role in plant growth. It is necessary to monitor the soil at the ﬁeld\nscale.\
    \ By obtaining the soil’s health information, a grower can make fruitful decisions\
    \ at\ndifferent plant developmental stages. The main objective of soil analysis\
    \ is to measure\nthe content of nutrients present in the soil, which ultimately\
    \ leads to many treatments to\nfulﬁll the level of nutrients. Remarkably, the\
    \ soil test is suggested annually in the spring\nseason; however, it can be changed\
    \ according to the local environmental conditions and\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n6 of 31\nconducted in the winter or autumn season [27]. Several soil factors,\
    \ such as soil types\nand soil moisture, are recommended to analyze and quantify\
    \ fertilizers and irrigation\nrequirements. These primary factors also help provide\
    \ information regarding the other\nvital factors, including physical, chemical,\
    \ biological ones. The soil map helps to identify\nareas with good soil health\
    \ and texture for the suitability of seeds, sowing time, and even\nsowing depth\
    \ because some plants have deep roots and others have shallow root depths.\nMany\
    \ researchers have recently developed tools, technologies, and devices to monitor\n\
    soil health. These new tools are the major resources for farmers and growers,\
    \ which can\nbe used to monitor soil features such as water holding capacity,\
    \ moisture, chemical, and\nphysical properties. These tools also help monitor\
    \ soil health, such as salinity, pH, soil\norganic carbon (SOC), electrical conductivity\
    \ (EC), nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus,\nwhich help estimate required fertilizers.\
    \ One of the latest tools introduced by Agro Cares is\nthe Scanner and Lab-in-box,\
    \ which is known as a laboratory, having complete information\nby services through\
    \ which it gives soil status information [28]. This is the modiﬁed tool\nused\
    \ by many farmers without any laboratory for sample analysis. This tool can analyze\n\
    about 100 soil samples daily.\nOne of the major issues for estimating crop water\
    \ requirements is continuously moni-\ntoring soil moisture. To monitor soil moisture,\
    \ in situ soil moisture sensors, remote sensors,\nand tools can be efﬁcient strategies\
    \ for many farms to obtain information about the soil’s\nmoisture. There are many\
    \ satellites in operation to measure soil moisture data at a global\nscale. These\
    \ remote sensing products are: (i) the Advanced Microwave Scanning Ra-\ndiometer\
    \ Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (2002–September 2011); (ii) the Soil Moisture\n\
    Ocean Salinity system (SMOS, 2010–present); (iii) AMSR2 (2012–present); and (iv)\
    \ the Soil\nMoisture Active Passive system (SMAP, 2015–present) [29]. For example,\
    \ Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS) was launched in 2009 and started to\
    \ monitor soil moisture from\nMay 2010 globally. In addition, in situ wireless\
    \ soil moisture sensors can also monitor soil\nmoisture at the farm scale.\nNew\
    \ tools, including the vision-based and wireless sensors, are used to determine\n\
    crop factors, such as soil depth, for efﬁcient seeding processes. Several robotic\
    \ tools are\ndeveloped for smart farming and improve crop production, such as\
    \ FarmBot and Agribots,\njust to name a couple. In agriculture practices, such\
    \ as sowing seeds, weeding, fertilizing,\nand irrigating, such tools would help\
    \ improve crop production if it is implemented at a\nlarge scale. Agribots is\
    \ a type of robot; the agriculture ﬁeld’s location is determined by\npairing digital\
    \ computers with the vehicle vision system. This type of robot works on any\n\
    agricultural land in which the global positioning system (GPS) helps develop location\
    \ maps.\nSensors that are mounted with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) help provide\
    \ information\nregarding the ﬂow rate of seed. Many remote sensors are used for\
    \ this purpose [30]. These\nLEDs are the source of receiving radiations that have\
    \ visible and infrared light waves. Seed\nmovement is monitored through many elements,\
    \ including light band, voltage output,\nand receiving element. Measurement of\
    \ the ﬂow rate of seed is conducted through signals\ncorrelated by transferring\
    \ seeds. Overall, advanced technologies and tools help analyze\nsoils, which further\
    \ help monitor crop growth and production.\n3.2. Irrigation\nOn the Earth, oceans\
    \ hold 97% of all water, but it is saline. The other three percent of\nwater is\
    \ fresh, among which 2% to 3% of the water is in the form of glaciers [31,32].\
    \ Out\nof three percent, half percent of freshwater is present as surface water,\
    \ and the remaining\nfreshwater is groundwater. People have to rely on the half\
    \ percent of freshwater to sustain\ntheir lives. This half percent of freshwater\
    \ includes water storage in lakes, rivers, and other\nreservoirs. Agriculture\
    \ uses almost 75% of freshwater [33,34]. In many countries, such as\nBrazil, the\
    \ demand for crops has increased to 75% [35]. Among several constraints, the lack\n\
    of proper monitoring tools to estimate crop water requirement is the actual cause\
    \ of the\nad hoc application of irrigation water. For example, the US uses about\
    \ 80% of freshwater\nfor irrigation purposes [5]. In the United Nations Convention\
    \ to Combat Desertiﬁcation\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n7 of 31\n(UNCCD) held\
    \ in 2013, it was found that about 168 countries of the world have a shortage\n\
    of water for irrigation. Research has showed that there would be a huge water\
    \ shortage for\nirrigation throughout the world by 2030 [36].\nDue to the increase\
    \ in irrigation water requirements, freshwater will only be available\nto those\
    \ countries that have adopted the best water resources management practice. For\n\
    this purpose, to reduce the water shortage, awareness programs should be promoted\
    \ to\nadopt effective irrigation practices. Many new irrigation techniques, including\
    \ sprinkler\nand drip irrigation methods, are used to reduce the losses and water\
    \ shortage. Traditional\napproaches, including furrow and ﬂood irrigation, cause\
    \ the waste of water. Moreover,\ntraditional irrigation approaches (e.g., ﬂooding)\
    \ reduce many soil nutrients through water\nlosses, which impact crop yield. Robust\
    \ technologies and tools are needed, which include\nsmart irrigation techniques.\
    \ The smart irrigation techniques help estimate crop water\nrequirements based\
    \ on soil types, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic conditions. In this\n\
    situation, many new tools such as the IoT play a signiﬁcant role in measuring\
    \ air and soil\nhumidity, which ultimately leads to the improvement of crops.\n\
    Crop improvement and its quality can be enhanced by the effective management of\n\
    soil and water. The use of the IoT, such as for irrigation management based on\
    \ the crop\nwater stress index (CWSI), is expected to improve crop efﬁciency signiﬁcantly\
    \ [30]. For this\nreason, the calculation of the CWSI requires one to obtain a\
    \ crop canopy at different times\nand temperatures. A CWSI is a wireless sensor-based\
    \ monitoring system that includes\nseveral crop parameter measurement systems\
    \ that help estimate moisture status, which is\nused to estimate irrigation water\
    \ requirements [11].\n3.3. Crop Disease and Its Management\nFamine in Ireland\
    \ occurred due to Phytophthora infestans, causing the late blight of\npotato,\
    \ which caused many crop losses. Due to this famine, about one million people\
    \ in\nIreland died [37]. In the USA, the southern corn leaf blight caused by Cochliobolus\
    \ heterostro-\nphus brought famine and crop losses of nearly one billion USD.\
    \ Later, this crop disease was\nspread to Canada [38]. The Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) estimated 20% to\n40% annual crop loss per year due to crop\
    \ diseases [39]. Several agricultural management\nstrategies were applied to recover\
    \ these losses, such as the use of pesticides and fungi-\ncides. These approaches\
    \ are practiced in advanced agriculture since the last century. It\nis estimated\
    \ that approximately 500,000 tons of pesticides are used each year in the US\n\
    alone. In contrast, in other countries of the world, about two million tons of\
    \ pesticides are\napplied for disease management [40]. Although these pesticides\
    \ are used for plant disease\nmanagement to increase crop production, there are\
    \ many other harmful aspects to animals\nand humans’ health. It also disturbs\
    \ the world’s ecology and eventually causes severe\nenvironmental pollution to\
    \ the entire ecosystem [5,41].\nMany of the advanced technologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, play a signiﬁcant role in reducing\nthe usage of these chemicals, which\
    \ are hazardous to human health. Many crop disease\nmonitoring programs such as\
    \ crop modeling, the prediction of pests, and weather forecasts\nare monitored\
    \ by these advanced and emerging technologies in agriculture. These tech-\nnologies\
    \ are considered effective approaches for plant/crop disease management [42,43].\n\
    Although treatment, perception, and assessment are important in disease forecasting,\n\
    monitoring, and management, advanced technologies (e.g., the IoT, wireless sensors,\
    \ and\nUAVs) are beneﬁcial for disease identiﬁcation and pest management. For\
    \ example, remote\nsensing technology can be used to capture large areas of agricultural\
    \ cropland economically.\nThe remote sensors can be used to analyze crop processing,\
    \ including disease and pests,\nplant health, and the environment [43,44]. This\
    \ remote sensing tool is low cost and has\nmany advantages, such as a low cost\
    \ for automatic activation and supporting recovery.\nFor example, recently, the\
    \ yields of many crops have been severely threatened by the poor\npollination\
    \ process [45].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n8 of 31\n3.4. Fertilizer\nPlant\
    \ growth, development, and reproduction mainly depend on the necessary nu-\ntrients\
    \ received from fertilizers or organic amendments. For the development of ﬂower,\n\
    fruit, and root, three signiﬁcant nutrients are needed: for leaf growth, nitrogen\
    \ is necessary;\nfor root development, phosphorus and the expansion of stem and\
    \ water passage in pant\npotassium is required [36]. Plant health can be affected\
    \ by the imbalance application of\nthese fertilizers to the plant. On the other\
    \ hand, the excessive application of these nutrients\nand fertilizers to the plant\
    \ not only affects plant health and causes economic losses but\nalso affects the\
    \ environment, including qualities of soil, water, and air. For example, only\n\
    half of the total nitrogen is utilized for crop development, and another half\
    \ of nitrogen\nis released into the environment. The imbalanced application of\
    \ undesired nutrients to\nthe crops causes a negative impact on the environment\
    \ and climate. It also increases the\nnutrient level in the soil [46]. New technology\
    \ such as the IoT is beneﬁcial for the exact\nestimation of the rate of fertilizers\
    \ in smart agriculture. These approaches also reduce the\nnegative effect on environmental\
    \ conditions.\nNew technology is used to estimate the spatial–temporal application\
    \ of nutrients\nfor the fulﬁllment of fertilization, which is relatively less\
    \ laborious and has maximum\nefﬁciency [47]. Generally, the normalized vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) is used to monitor\nvegetation health, which ultimately helps to\
    \ predict the application of nutrients in the\nsoil. The efﬁcacy of nutrient application\
    \ can be enhanced by such efﬁcient methods, which\nultimately reduces the other\
    \ effect on the environment. Many recent enabling technologies\nsuch as geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) [48], variable rate technology [49], and global\n\
    positioning systems (GPS) [50,51] are used to estimate nutrients in the ﬁeld [52–54].\
    \ For\nthe betterment of crops, it was observed that fertilizers are the best\
    \ source for improving\ncrop productions, and they can be triggered by only the\
    \ use of new tools and technology\nknown as the IoT [55].\n3.5. Crop Harvesting\
    \ Monitoring and Forecasting\nMoisture level, the ﬂow of grain mass, crop yield,\
    \ and quantity or number of grains per\ncrop are monitored and diagnosed by the\
    \ yield monitoring system. To analyze the crop’s\noverall performance, it is necessary\
    \ to check the level of the moisture and crop yield. Crop\nmonitoring during the\
    \ growing period is one of the essential processes. The measurement\nof crop yield\
    \ is not only critical at the time of harvest, but it is also important to measure\
    \ crop\nyield before the harvesting and during the crop’s developmental processes.\
    \ Various aspects\nare required for monitoring crop yield, including a high level\
    \ of pollination, particularly\nwhen the environment is changing; there is a need\
    \ for the prediction of seeds [56–58].\nCrop forecasting is a technique that predicts\
    \ yields before harvest occurs. Such fore-\ncasts help farmers make near-term\
    \ plans and decisions. Moreover, the accurate harvesting\ntime can be estimated\
    \ by the analysis of crop maturity and its quality. The monitoring\nprocess can\
    \ also judge many of the fruit factors such as fruit color, size, quality, and\
    \ devel-\nopmental stages. Crop disease management strategies and other developmental\
    \ stages\nsuch as crop yield and its quality can be enhanced by crop prediction.\
    \ For this, awareness\nabout the appropriate harvesting schedule is necessary\
    \ for the betterment of crops. Figure 3\nindicates a typical snapshot of the farm\
    \ area network (FAN), which gives real-time portraits\nof the whole agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to the farmer.\nA new technology, such as a developed yield monitor, can\
    \ be correlated with any\nmachine which is used for harvesting. The yield monitor\
    \ tool can also be connected with\na smartphone application named FarmRTX, which\
    \ shows accurate harvesting data. It\nultimately processes data to the manufacturer’s\
    \ web-based program [59]. This smartphone\napplication can be used to generate\
    \ high-deﬁned mapping tools and transfer them with\nother experts and growers\
    \ to export to the other farming tools for monitoring crop yield.\nSustainability\

    \ \nHuman beings exist for a relatively short time in history, so the adaption\
    \ of novel \ntechniques of enhancing food quantity and quality is not advanced.\
    \ For increasing crop \ndevelopment and yield, farmers have applied many measures,\
    \ such as pesticides and fer-\ntilizers. Although there are other management strategies\
    \ such as greenhouses, hydropon-\nics, vertical farming, etc., for increasing\
    \ crop production, these measures are not enough \nto fill this gap. Growers should\
    \ apply new devices such as the IoT for agriculture advance-\nment. \n4.1. Greenhouse\
    \ Agriculture \nGrowing plants in controlled conditions is a relatively new technology\
    \ and a type of \nadvanced agriculture. This technique became popular in the 19th\
    \ century when a number \nof greenhouses were built in Italy, the Netherlands,\
    \ and France for growing plants, un-\nseasonal vegetables, and fruits. This type\
    \ of new agriculture technology was enhanced in \nthe 20th century, and countries\
    \ with climate/weather issues started to apply this technol-\nogy rapidly [60].\
    \ Crops that are grown in a controlled environment require minimum in-\nputs because\
    \ crops grow under controlled conditions. This controlled environment is de-\n\
    veloped in the greenhouse. Due to this controlled environment, seasonal and unseasonal\
    \ \ncrops are grown anywhere and at any time in the world. Several new toolkits\
    \ such as \nwireless communication, mobile devices, and other internet devices\
    \ are used to adopt this \ntechnology. Benke and Tomkins [61], who conducted a\
    \ comprehensive analysis, reported \nthat advanced toolkits could help to adopt\
    \ greenhouse technology. Various other toolkits, \nFigure 3. Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT)-based farm area devices [5,11–14].\n4. Advanced Agricultural Approaches\n\

    Growing plants in controlled conditions is a relatively new technology and a type\
    \ of\nadvanced agriculture. This technique became popular in the 19th century\
    \ when a number\nof greenhouses were built in Italy, the Netherlands, and France\

    \ technology was enhanced in the\n20th century, and countries with climate/weather\
    \ issues started to apply this technology\nrapidly [60]. Crops that are grown\
    \ in a controlled environment require minimum inputs\nbecause crops grow under\
    \ controlled conditions. This controlled environment is developed\nin the greenhouse.\
    \ Due to this controlled environment, seasonal and unseasonal crops are\ngrown\
    \ anywhere and at any time in the world. Several new toolkits such as wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication, mobile devices, and other internet devices are used to adopt\
    \ this technology.\nBenke and Tomkins [61], who conducted a comprehensive analysis,\
    \ reported that advanced\ntoolkits could help to adopt greenhouse technology.\
    \ Various other toolkits, including\nprototype-based internet, are used to monitor\
    \ weather parameters, such as temperature,\npressure, and humidity.\n4.2. Hydroponics\n\
    The most advanced method for seasonal and unseasonal crops is to grow in water\n\
    under controlled conditions without a soil medium. In this approach, nutrients\
    \ and\nfertilizers are applied through the irrigation system. When VF and hydroponics\
    \ are used in\ncombination, every square meter farm can use almost 95% less water\
    \ and nutrients without\nusing any chemicals [62]. In a hydroponics system, the\
    \ accuracy of nutrient measurement\nis critical. Therefore, a highly reliable\
    \ wireless control system for tomato hydroponics was\nproposed [63,64]. In this\
    \ method, monitoring the water content and its accuracy is essential.\nIn a prototype\
    \ based on wireless sensors, it was proposed to provide the cultivation of crops\n\
    in hydroponics by the turnkey solution, which gives the measurements and estimations\n\
    regarding the plant growth in the absence of soil media. Furthermore, there was\
    \ a new tool,\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n10 of 31\na compact sensor that\
    \ uses the oscillator circuit. The primary purpose of this device is to\nmonitor\
    \ the occurrence and concentration of different fertilizers and irrigation levels\
    \ [65].\n4.3. Vertical Farming (VF)\nArable land is decreasing with the increase\
    \ in the human population, urbanization,\npollution, and soil erosion. The VF\
    \ is the progressive technique of advanced agriculture,\nwhich allows one to grow\
    \ the crops and plants in controlled conditions, and signiﬁcantly,\nthis efﬁciently\
    \ decreases the consumption of many resources. VF is the most suitable\nagricultural\
    \ approach in which a small patch of land is required to cultivate crops compared\n\
    to traditional farming. This conventional farming technique needs several resources,\
    \ not\nonly for crops [65,66]. Unfortunately, current farming practices, based\
    \ on industrialized\nagriculture, are destroying soil health much more than natural\
    \ reconstruction. Overall, it\nhas been reported that the soil erosion rate is\
    \ higher (10 to 40 times) than the formation\nrate of the soil. Recent measures\
    \ used for farming cause a loss of healthy soil from the\nagricultural land, which\
    \ is a major hazard to food production in the upcoming days.\nBesides, as we assume,\
    \ about 70% of the freshwater is only utilized for the farming system,\nwhich\
    \ will enhance the pressure on the existing water reservoirs or storage. VF is\
    \ the\nsolution for many limitations and challenges for land management and a\
    \ shortage of\nfreshwater.\nFor this purpose, according to Mirai, a Japanese-based\
    \ indoor farming tool provides\ndata of about 25,000 square meters of Japanese\
    \ agricultural farms. Notably, it utilizes\nthe minimum level of irrigation water\
    \ compared to the production of crops in outdoor\nconditions and 40% of the energy\
    \ [67]. The aviation farm is the leader of VF, where the yield\nof agricultural\
    \ products in New York increased by 390 times, while water consumption was\nreduced\
    \ by 95% [68]. Carbon dioxide is one of the crucial factors in farming as compared\n\
    to other aspects of agriculture. For the estimation of carbon dioxide, a new toolkit,\
    \ which is\na non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide wireless sensor that\
    \ participates in the\ncomplete control of VF [69,70] connected to mobile devices\
    \ and wireless communication\ntechnologies. These devices can automatically check\
    \ the crops at each development phase.\n4.4. Phenotyping\nThe smart methods discussed\
    \ earlier seem more promising for advancing agriculture,\nas they have been utilized\
    \ to grow various crops in a conducive environment. Besides,\nsome advanced technologies\
    \ are evaluated to control their limitations through advanced\nsensing and communication\
    \ technologies, thereby further enhancing crop capabilities. The\nmost efﬁcient\
    \ method is the phenotyping approach, the advanced genetic engineering tech-\n\
    nique, and biotechnology, which correlates the genetic sequences of crops for\
    \ agronomical\nand physiological aspects, as described in Figure 4. In the last\
    \ few decades, several modiﬁ-\ncations have been made in the ﬁeld of genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology. However,\nmany factors such as grain weight and disease resistance\
    \ have not been dealt with yet due\nto a lack of efﬁcient techniques.\nRecent\
    \ advancements have described that phenotypes play an efﬁcient role in de-\ntermining\
    \ many quantitative factors such as plant growth, disease resistance, crop yield,\n\
    and crop quality in advanced genetic engineering and biotechnology [71]. One of\
    \ these\ntools is image-based phenotypes and sensors, which monitor how these\
    \ resolutions cannot\naccommodate numerous screen stimulants and help them understand\
    \ the mode of action,\nthereby participating in their success [72]. Moreover,\
    \ other tools such as the IoT and\nCropQuant-based phenotypes techniques are used\
    \ to analyze many crop-related factors\nsuch as crop traits by genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology for advanced agriculture [73].\nMoreover, an automated production\
    \ site-controlled program was established to continue\nthe generation of data\
    \ by this program. Machine learning modeling and feature analysis\nalgorithms\
    \ are given to exploit the association among phenotypes, growth environments,\n\
    and genotypes.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n11 of 31\n \nfor agronomical and\

    \ have not \nbeen dealt with yet due to a lack of efficient techniques. \n \n\

    \ advanced genetic engineering and biotechnology [71]. One of these tools \nis\
    \ image-based phenotypes and sensors, which monitor how these resolutions cannot\
    \ ac-\ncommodate numerous screen stimulants and help them understand the mode\
    \ of action, \nthereby participating in their success [72]. Moreover, other tools\
    \ such as the IoT and \nCropQuant-based phenotypes techniques are used to analyze\
    \ many crop-related factors \nsuch as crop traits by genetic engineering and biotechnology\
    \ for advanced agriculture \n[73]. Moreover, an automated production site-controlled\
    \ program was established to con-\ntinue the generation of data by this program.\
    \ Machine learning modeling and feature anal-\nysis algorithms are given to exploit\
    \ the association among phenotypes, growth environ-\nments, and genotypes. \n\
    5. Major Equipment and Technologies \nIn traditional agriculture, most farming\
    \ measures are applied by heavy machinery, \nincluding harvesters, massive robots,\
    \ and tractors. Several communications and remote \nsensing techniques are used\
    \ to operate these machines. In advanced farming, for many \ncrop-related practices\
    \ such as irrigation, sowing, fertilizer application, and harvesting of \ncrops,\
    \ these machines and equipment are supported by GIS and GPS technologies, which\
    \ \nare very accurate, efficient, and precise. Moreover, other agricultural measures\
    \ (the site-\nspecific management of crops) cannot replace these advanced techniques.\
    \ The develop-\nment of contemporary agriculture needs the efficiency of gathered\
    \ information and gen-\nerally has two parts [9]. First, remote sensing programs\
    \ with multifunctional devices, in-\ncluding UAVs, aircraft, and satellites, are\
    \ needed. Second, many other devices, such as \nground and remote sensors, are\
    \ required for particular functions at different locations. A \nGPS device can\
    \ be used to identify the data collection spot’s location, which can be used \n\
    for location-specific processing.  \nOver the past few decades, agriculture has\
    \ shifted from small and medium-sized ag-\nriculture to highly industrialized\
    \ and commercial agriculture. This shift plays an im-\nportant role in advancing\
    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries be-\nFigure 4. The\

    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries because,\nin agriculture,\
    \ data, control, and measurement are signiﬁcant factors in accomplishing\nequality\
    \ among production and cost to enhance outputs. For this purpose, the IoT is a\
    \ fun-\ndamental approach for advancement and beneﬁts in agriculture, which are\
    \ well planned,\nmanaged, and automated. According to this information, between\
    \ 2017 and 2022, the\nworld’s advanced agricultural industry is expected to grow\
    \ by 19.3% in one year and reach\nUSD 23.14 billion in 2022 [33].\n5.1. Smartphone\n\
    Although strong cellular communications coverage is lacking, cellular communica-\n\
    tions are the main communication methods in remote regions. Whenever a contractor\n\
    is needed to update most agricultural communities, smartphones are a powerful\
    \ com-\nmunication technology and the primary method of communication. Recent\
    \ advances in\nthe smartphone industry have led to a sharp drop in prices, which\
    \ has made the sector\nmore attractive, especially for small farmers in rural\
    \ regions. According to the global\nsystem assessment for mobile communications,\
    \ this proportion is almost eight percent [74].\nMoreover, features and ﬂexibility,\
    \ including GPS, microphone cameras, accelerometers,\nproximity, and gyroscopes,\
    \ have attracted IT technicians who are creating more attractive\nsmartphone functions\
    \ to satisfy many demands of farmers [75–78].\nDue to advancements in the research,\
    \ experts have developed various new tools and\napproaches strategically to implement\
    \ smartphone technology in agriculture. Several\ndeveloping countries, such as\
    \ Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Mali, and Zimbabwe, are\nadopting advanced tools\
    \ and techniques in agriculture [79–82]. Moreover, smartphone\ntechnology is used\
    \ in many countries, such as China, Turkey, India, and several African\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n12 of 31\ncountries, which are listed above. These countries\
    \ are implementing this advanced tech-\nnology to increase agriculture production\
    \ and boost their economies [83–86]. The use\nof smartphones in the agricultural\
    \ sector signiﬁcantly depends upon numerous aspects.\nFor this purpose, studies\
    \ were conducted to determine smartphones’ usage for several\nagriculture measures\
    \ [87].\nTable 1 presents the classiﬁcation of smartphone-related sensors that\
    \ have attracted\nexperts to use them for different agricultural purposes. Table\

    \ and reporting of information are considered to be the\ncentral part of advanced\
    \ agriculture. The strong connection and participation of many\nfactors are needed\
    \ to retrieve efﬁcient and signiﬁcant purposes. Telecom operators play\nan essential\
    \ role in disseminating communication reliability in agriculture development.\n\
    Moreover, expanding the advancement of the IoT and widespread knowledge to improve\n\
    the advanced agricultural industry needs a highly efﬁcient management system.\
    \ Many\nfactors, including coverage, energy consumption, reliability, and cost,\
    \ are signiﬁcant and\nnecessary before selecting a communication method.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Cellular Communication\nDepending on the purpose and bandwidth requirements,\
    \ a cellular communication\nmode increase from 2G to 5G might be appropriate.\
    \ Besides, the reliability and even\naccessibility of cellular networks is a key\
    \ factor in rural areas. To solve this major problem,\ninformation transmission\
    \ through satellite is another important option. Still, in this case,\nthe price\
    \ of this communication mode can be very high, which makes it inappropriate for\n\
    small and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication model also relies on\
    \ the\nrequirements of the application. For example, some farms require sensors\
    \ to operate at a\nlow data rate, but they need to work for a long time and require\
    \ a longer battery life. In\nthis case, the new series of the low-power wide area\
    \ network (LPWAN) is considered to be\nan excellent answer for cellular networks.\
    \ The LPWAN has a longer battery life and has\na more massive connection range,\
    \ and an affordable price (2 to 15 USD) [103]. Currently,\ncrop and pasture management\
    \ are the two main applications where LPWAN networks\nare very suitable, and due\
    \ to their success, they can be used for many other agricultural\napplications\
    \ [104]. Generally, wireless sensors used in agricultural applications are divided\n\
    into three main categories according to the communication information rate and\
    \ power\nconsumption (Table 3).\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n14 of 31\nTable\

    \ farming.\nCommunication/Data Type\nPossible Applications\nExpected Data Size\n\

    \ wireless communication mode that links small-sized devices\nover short distances.\
    \ There are many IoT agriculture devices that are Bluetooth enabled,\nsuch as\
    \ Farm note Air gateway and Color sensor work with Bluetooth-enabled sensors.\n\
    Bluetooth has an ubiquitous nature, due to which it is studied as suitable equipment\
    \ for\nmulti-tier farming functions [105].\n5.2.3. Zigbee\nZigbee is mainly created\
    \ for a comprehensive range of applications, particularly\nto replace non-standard\
    \ equipment. According to application needs, devices based on\nthis etiquette\
    \ can be one of the three categories: router, coordinator, and end-devices.\n\
    Besides, Zigbee networks support three different topologies, namely Cluster Tree,\
    \ Start, and\nMesh [106]. Based on these traits and contemplating the needs of\
    \ agricultural applications,\nZigBee can perform a signiﬁcant role, particularly\
    \ for the environments of greenhouses\nthat often require short-range transmissions.\
    \ During different parameter observations,\nactual-time information from the sensor\
    \ nodes is transmitted to the terminal server via\nZigbee [107,108]. For applications\
    \ such as fertilizers and irrigation, the ZigBee module can\nbe used for transmission,\
    \ such as in drip irrigation, to check the soil moisture content.\n5.3. Sensor\
    \ Devices\nAmong all the devices used in advanced agriculture today, sensor devices\
    \ are highly\ncritical and perform a crucial role in collecting crop status and\
    \ other information. Sensor\ndevices can be utilized separately or in the group\
    \ as needed. Moreover, sensor devices\nare used for advanced farming because of\
    \ their robust technology. Next, the discussion is\nbased on the working process\
    \ and purpose of the main sensor types and their beneﬁts. The\nmajor sensor devices\
    \ used in advanced agriculture are listed in Table 4.\nTable 4. Types of sensor\
    \ devices.\nWireless Sensors\nEmployment\nReferences\nTelematics Sensors\nTelematics\
    \ sensors are the leading equipment used for communication, an agricultural-based\n\
    toolkit, which is the most accurate and precise communication tool. This application\
    \ is mainly\nused to gather information from remote areas that are not accessible\
    \ easily, report the\ninformation of the machine’s working status, collect information\
    \ about areas, locations, and\nassist in locating travel routes. These programs\
    \ help farming managers automatically store\nand record information correlated\
    \ with agriculture.\n[109–111]\nRemote Sensing\nRemote sensing tools are used\
    \ to capture and store geographical information and several\nenvironmental and\
    \ climatic parameters. Moreover, it helps in managing, manipulating,\ndisplaying,\
    \ and analyzing geographical and spatial information. These sensors help assess\n\
    several factors, such as forecasting, monitoring, yield assessment, crop evaluation,\
    \ land\ndegradation, and pest management (e.g., using LiDAR, satellite, UAVs).\
    \ For example, the\nArgos sensor can be used for processing, disseminating, and\
    \ collecting global-based data and\nis compatible with smartphone platforms.\n\

    Employment\nReferences\nAcoustic Sensor\nAcoustic sensors provide other tools\
    \ for farm management, such as weeding and fruit\nharvesting. The major advantage\
    \ of this advanced technology is its low price with quick\nresponse capabilities,\
    \ particularly when considering convenient devices.\n[33,117,118]\nLight Detection\n\
    and Ranging\n(LIDAR)\nThis technology is utilized in different agricultural applications,\
    \ including segmentation, land\nmapping, farm 3D models, determining soil types,\
    \ yield prediction, soil loss, and monitoring\nerosion. Moreover, LiDAR is also\
    \ utilized to monitor dynamic measurements, such as leaf\narea and fruit.\n[119–124]\n\
    Optical Sensor\nThese sensors use the phenomenon of light reﬂection to help measure\
    \ soil organic matter, soil\nmoisture, and color, the presence of minerals and\
    \ their composition, clay content, etc. These\nsensors can be used to evaluate\
    \ the soil’s ability to reﬂect light based on different parts of the\nselector’s\
    \ magnetic ﬁeld.\n[125,126]\nUltrasonic Ranging\nSensor\nThis type of sensor can\
    \ be one of the best choices in various agricultural applications because\nof\
    \ its low price. It is easy to use, and its sampling rate can easily be adjusted/modiﬁed.\n\
    Frequent uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (for example, boom\
    \ height\nand width control for uniform spray reporting, object detection, and\
    \ collision avoidance), and\ncrop canopy monitoring.\n[127–129]\nOptoelectronic\n\
    Sensor\nOptoelectronic sensors can distinguish plant types; hence, they help to\
    \ detect weeds, and\nother plants, particularly in wide-row crops. Optoelectronic\
    \ sensors are also capable of\ndifferentiating between vegetation and soil from\
    \ their reﬂection spectra.\n[130]\nElectromagnetic\nSensor\nElectromagnetic sensors\
    \ are used to record conductivity and transient electromagnetic\nresponses, identify\
    \ electrical responses and adjust variable-rate applications in practical\nsituations.\
    \ Sensors based on this technology use electrical circuits to measure the ability\
    \ of\nsoil particles to conduct or accumulate charge, which is mainly accomplished\
    \ by two\nmethods; contact or non-contact.\n[131]\nElectrochemical\nSensor\nThis\
    \ is used to assess soil characteristics to analyze the soil’s nutrient level,\
    \ for example, pH.\nStandard chemical soil assessment methods are often time-consuming\
    \ and expensive and can\nbe simply replaced with these advanced sensors. These\
    \ sensors are used to measure macro\nand micronutrients, salinity, and pH in the\
    \ soil precisely.\n[132,133]\nMechanical\nSensors\nMechanical sensors evaluate\
    \ the mechanical resistance (compaction) of the soil to indicate\nvariable compaction.\
    \ Mechanical sensors enter or pass through the soil and record forces\nevaluated\
    \ by strain gauges or load cells.\n[134]\nAirﬂow Sensor\nThese sensors measure\
    \ the soil’s permeability and moisture content and identify the soil\nstructure\
    \ to distinguish different soil types. Measurements can be made in a single position\
    \ or\ndynamically during movement, for example, in a ﬁxed position or mobile mode.\n\
    [135]\nMass Flow Sensor\nThis sensor is used for yield monitoring because it provides\
    \ yield information by measuring\nthe amount of grain ﬂow (for example, when passing\
    \ through a combine harvesting).\n[136,137]\nEddy\nCovariance-Based\nSensor\n\
    This sensor can be utilized to quantify the exchange of water vapor, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand other hydrologic and climatic parameters. This eddy covariance\
    \ technique provides a\nrobust technique to quantify the gas ﬂuxes among soil,\
    \ vegetation, and atmosphere, which\nare essential for most agricultural applications\
    \ in various ecosystems.\n[134,138]\nSWLB Sensor\nSoft water level-based (SWLB)\
    \ sensors are utilized in advanced agricultural watersheds to\nmonitor hydrological\
    \ behavior, including flow and water level, inflexible time-step acquisitions.\n\
    [9,136]\nNote: This list is an effort to compile most of sensors used in the advanced\
    \ agriculture. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list as many\nmore sensor\
    \ devices are used in agriculture.\n5.4. Advanced Machines Used to Advance Agriculture\n\
    As technology advances, most manufacturers provide tractors with automatic drives.\n\
    This equipment is not advanced because self-driving tractors were already on the\
    \ market\neven before semi-autonomous vehicles. One of the major beneﬁts of self-driving\
    \ tractors is\nthe capacity to prevent re-entering in a similar area or a similar\
    \ row via decreasing overlaps\nwith less than an inch. Moreover, they can create\
    \ extremely accurate turns without a\ndriver. The device provides higher accuracy\
    \ and reduces errors, especially when spraying\npesticides or target weeds; these\
    \ are almost impossible when people control the machine.\nAlthough there are no\
    \ fully automated tractors/machines in the market today, many\nscientists, researchers,\
    \ and manufacturers are working to develop the new equipment.\nBased on the future\
    \ needs of high-tech new tractors, it is expected that about 700,000 new\ntractors\
    \ outﬁtted with features such as tractor guidance or automatic steering will be\
    \ sold\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n16 of 31\nby 2028 [5,139]. Further, it\
    \ is expected that about 40,000 unmanned driving, completely\nautonomous cars\
    \ (level 5), and tractors will be sold by 2038 [109].\nHowever, most farmers cannot\
    \ afford such advanced farming machines, and most\ntractor service providers and\
    \ manufacturers operate far below their potentials. Considering\nthese challenges,\
    \ for example, Hello Tractor has developed a solution to these problems.\nThe\
    \ company has developed a low-cost monitoring device that can be installed on\
    \ any\ntractor, providing powerful software and analysis tools [113,140]. The\
    \ beneﬁts of this\ndevice are twofold: it ensures that most growers can afford\
    \ the tractor’s total cost while\nmonitoring the condition of the tractor and\
    \ reports if any problems occur. The software\nconnects tractor owners to farmers\
    \ who need tractor services, just like Uber’s tractors.\nAnother major example\
    \ is Case IH’s Magnum series tractors, which use on-board cameras\nand light detection\
    \ and ranging (LiDAR) sensors to detect the object that helps avoid\ncollision\
    \ and control accidents caused by agricultural vehicles [141].\n5.5. Cloud Computing\n\
    Growers can use cloud facilities to access data from predictive analytics agencies\
    \ so\nthat they can ﬁnd the right products based on their exact needs. Cloud computing\
    \ offers\ngrowers a knowledge-based repository that contains valuable information\
    \ and experience\nrelated to farming methods and equipment options available on\
    \ the market. The scheme\ncan be further extended to include access to consumer\
    \ databases, supply chains, and billing\nsystems to make it more active.\nObviously,\
    \ cloud-based services offer ample opportunities but also bring new chal-\nlenges.\
    \ First, various sensors are being developed and utilized in smart farming, each\n\
    with its unique data format and semantics. Second, most decision support systems\
    \ are\napplication-speciﬁc. On the other hand, farmers may need access to various\
    \ systems for\nspeciﬁc applications, such as soil monitoring. Considering these\
    \ two situations, cloud-\nbased decision support systems not only need to handle\
    \ the diverse data and their formats,\nbut they should also be able to conﬁgure\
    \ these formats for various applications.\n5.6. Harvesting\nIn the agriculture\
    \ sector, harvesting is a crucial phase in the crop production process\nbecause\
    \ this ﬁnal stage determines crop yield and, eventually, the crop’s performance.\n\
    Regarding manpower, it is expected that the US faces USD 3.1 billion worth of\
    \ crop losses\neach year due to manpower shortages [142]. Additionally, according\
    \ to the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), 14% of total agricultural\
    \ costs are spent on wages\nand labor, and as high as 39% on some labor-intensive\
    \ farms [143]. Considering the\nexpense and manpower shortage issues at this stage,\
    \ farm experts hope that the use of\nagricultural robotics technology will not\
    \ only reduce manpower shortage but also provide\nﬂexible harvesting capabilities\
    \ when required. Automatic fruit harvesting requires in-depth\nresearch on sophisticated\
    \ sensors that can collect precise and unambiguous information\nabout speciﬁc\
    \ crops and fruits.\nFor example, strawberries are highly consumed fruits and\
    \ can be purchased all year\nround. However, manpower, particularly during the\
    \ packaging and harvesting stages, is a\nmajor factor for the high-level price\
    \ of this fruit [144]. Because this fruit is mostly cultivated\nin the greenhouses\
    \ system, the harvesting robot can reduce the production cost. A robot\ndeveloped\
    \ by Agrobot is capable of collecting strawberries along the ﬁeld’s strawberry\n\
    plant rows and enhancing packaging through the operator [145]. For example, Agrobot’s\n\
    SW 6010 is a semi-automatic robot for semi-automatic strawberry picking. Tektu\
    \ T-100 is a\nrechargeable electric strawberry harvester that operates multiple\
    \ channels with a net-zero\nemission [144].\n6. Uses of UAVs in Agriculture Advancement\n\
    Currently, the IoT plays an important role in several ﬁelds, such as the agriculture\n\
    industry (e.g., ﬁsh and poultry). There is a limited communication network in\
    \ the agricul-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n17 of 31\ntural sector, including\
    \ Wi-Fi and base stations, which decreases the coverage of internet\ntechnology.\
    \ Advanced communication technologies are the worst in developing countries,\n\
    which are the major hurdles and challenges for the implementation of the IoT in\
    \ agriculture.\nWithout a reliable communication infrastructure, the information\
    \ collected using sensor\ndevices is not transferred quickly for analysis in developing\
    \ countries [146]. Under these\ncircumstances, UAVs can provide an alternate option\
    \ to gather information for data analysis\nand processing. Moreover, UAVs equipped\
    \ with advanced thermal, multispectral, hyper-\nspectral cameras, and wireless\
    \ sensors can collect data from several hectares of agricultural\nlands in a short\
    \ duration. Currently, the agriculture sector can obtain tremendous beneﬁts\n\
    by deploying UAVs to address several major and long-term issues. We highlight\
    \ some\nimportant areas where UAVs have played a crucial role in assisting growers\
    \ throughout\nthe crop cycle globally [147].\n6.1. Soil and Water Analysis\nNew\
    \ technology such as UAVs can provide accurate data to examine soil and soil\n\
    water before planting crops, which can help determine which crops are best suited\
    \ for a\nparticular land. In addition, it can provide information about the type\
    \ of seed and how it\ncan be grown under particular soils and environments [148].\n\
    6.2. Planting\nToday, millions of acres are not cultivated worldwide due to the\
    \ lack of appropriate\nmanpower or human inaccessibility. The safety issue of\
    \ the rough terrain is the major\nproblem for not utilizing these areas for agricultural\
    \ or forestry purposes. To this end,\ndrone-based sowing methods are being established\
    \ that can reduce sowing expenses by up\nto 85% [149]. Not only is it cost-effective,\
    \ but it even expedites the planting because many\nnewly formed drones can plant\
    \ about 100,000 trees within one day [150]. These systems\nshoot pods comprise\
    \ seed, which are essential nutrients required for plant growth. This\ntechnique\
    \ is very effective for rough terrain; signiﬁcantly, the success rate is more\
    \ than\n75% [151]. Because of the ﬂexibility and success, the recommended drones\
    \ can be excellent\nplantation systems worldwide [152,153].\n6.3. Irrigation\n\
    The beneﬁt of using UAVs are twofold in irrigation applications. First, equipping\n\
    drones with various cameras and sensors can support the identiﬁcation of areas\
    \ under\nwater stress to quantify irrigation water requirements. Second, they\
    \ can also be utilized to\nspray herbicides and pesticides accurately and water\
    \ on crops, particularly in emergencies,\nwhich can save time [154–156]. Besides,\
    \ UAVs can also be utilized to assess crop water\nstress [157]. Because of advanced\
    \ UAVs, these can be applied as water-saving tools. UAVs\nuse not only facilitate\
    \ improving watering efﬁciency but also identify leaks in irrigation\nor possible\
    \ water sinks, such as “JT20L-606” [158] and “AGRASMG-1” [159], which are\nspecially\
    \ developed UAVs that are currently being utilized to serve this purpose.\n6.4.\
    \ Health Assessment of the Crops\nScanning agriculture crops using infrared and\
    \ visible (IR) light sensor technology\nmounted on the UAVs can recognize which\
    \ farming plants may be infested via fungicide\nor bacteria. Detecting any such\
    \ issues in advance helps prevent the disease from spreading\nto other crops or\
    \ plant parts [160].\n6.5. Spraying Pesticides/Herbicides\nUAVs can be utilized\
    \ to spray insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides on crops. Spray-\ning applications\
    \ will beneﬁt current practices of spraying pesticides or herbicides across\n\
    the entire farm that is usually not needed in most cases. If UAVs are used to\
    \ spray the\npesticides or herbicides, they can be directly sprayed on weeds or\
    \ only concentrate on the\ndisturbed area. It can be poured directly on weeds.\
    \ Besides, since UAV spraying is highly\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n18 of\
    \ 31\ntargeted to the objects/plants or weeds, it can be conﬁgured and sprayed\
    \ as required,\nreducing overall expenses. For UAVs, handling sudden environmental\
    \ changes, such as\nwind direction, is problematic, mainly when spraying applications\
    \ [160].\n6.6. Plant Species Detection/Identiﬁcation\nRecently, UAVs have begun\
    \ to identify plant species, particularly those that are\nvery few on the planet.\
    \ UAVs are the best tools for this task, as they can ﬂy in very\nremote places\
    \ with limited physical access. According to the National Tropical Botanical\n\
    Garden (NTBG), Hawaiian calyx Hibiscadelphus woodii was found on a vertical cliff\
    \ face\nusing a drone, which was believed to have become extinct in 2009 [161,162].\
    \ Precision\nfarming desperately requires spatial information on crop density\
    \ when making decisions\nduring several applications. Quantities and plant numbers\
    \ not only reﬂect crop yields,\nbut they can accurately assess outcomes and determine\
    \ the fate of a crop. Gnädinger and\nSchmidhalter [163] counted corn plants digitally\
    \ using drones. Additionally, Jin et al. [164]\nproposed a technique to use UAVs\
    \ to evaluate wheat plants’ density at the seedling phase\nand captured images\
    \ using a Sony ILCEα5100LRGB camera. Crop monitoring is a daunting\ntask and is\
    \ inefﬁcient due to the large coverage area. Compared with satellite images used\n\
    in the past, UAVs provide all farm results by providing real-time monitoring data,\
    \ so\nthey are further accurate and cost-effective. Microdrones’ + m accessory\
    \ kit offers aerial\nimaging capabilities to monitor moisture content, crop nutrients\
    \ status, and other essential\nfactors [165,166].\n7. Food Safety and Transportation\n\

    \ \nThe World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Comprehensive Report on Future Food\
    \ De-\nmand, released in 2018, highlights the food industry’s need to feed ten\
    \ billion people be-\nfore 2050. The statement aims for a five-course menu of\

    \ losses of food occurring along the food supply chain (from food \nproduction\
    \ to consumption) at different geographical regions worldwide are depicted in\
    \ \nFigure 5. The highest percentage of calories lost and wastage (61%) in food\

    \ \nIn addition to the WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also\
    \ shock-\ning. It is projected that one-third of all food produced for humans\
    \ globally wasted each \nFigure 5. Losses of food occur along the food supply\
    \ chain [5,167].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n19 of 31\nIn addition to the\
    \ WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also shocking.\nIt is\
    \ projected that one-third of all food produced for humans globally wasted each\
    \ year is\nworth USD 1 trillion [168,169]. Food waste in the US alone accounts\
    \ for 1.3% of its gross\ndomestic product [170]. Based on these numbers, it can\
    \ be assumed that food wastage is\ncritical in food industries, and such loss\
    \ does not exist in non-food industries [171]. Even\nthough food wastage worth\
    \ USD 1 trillion has its economic value, more signiﬁcantly, the\nimpact of these\
    \ losses on the environment is critical. For example, the water wasted on\nproducing\
    \ food that has never been consumed is the same as the water that can meet\nthe\
    \ water demand of all of Africa [167,172,173]. Today, all over the world, only\
    \ 10% of\nperishable foods are properly well-preserved [174]. There is a massive\
    \ opportunity to\nreduce food losses and better distribute food simply via realizing\
    \ temperature-regulated\ntransportation systems. Based on these facts, it can\
    \ be concluded that enhancing food\nproduction is not enough to attain food safety.\
    \ However, many useful actions are needed to\nobtain a better-skilled way of distributing\
    \ existing food effectively. As shown in Figure 5,\nthe IoT can monitor and maintain\
    \ food quality at all stages of the entire supply chain from\nyield to consumption.\n\
    7.1. Compliance\nThe IoT can support the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control\
    \ Point (HACCP) com-\npliance, provide food security, and is an excellent monitoring\
    \ program that continuously\naccumulates the temperature data in kitchen equipment\
    \ and coolers. Its integration with\nthe touch module is utilized to monitor the\
    \ temperature in the cooler and the preparation\nchamber continuously [175].\n\
    7.2. Laird Sentrius\nThe battery-powered remote integrated sensor system takes\
    \ full advantage of Blue-\ntooth Low Energy (BLE) and Low Power Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRaWAN) connectivity. It\nis based on Nordic nRF51 silicon, Semtech SX1272,\
    \ and offers an 868/915 MHz LoRaWAN\noption and provides high nRF51 performance\
    \ at precise humidity temperature. The two\nmost important families consist of\
    \ RG1xx and RS1xx (multi-wireless gateways) to operate\ncollectively to deliver\
    \ cloud-based services. It is highly signiﬁcant and needs cheap end-\npoint radios\
    \ and other complex base stations to handle the network system compared with\n\
    low-power wide-area network technology. If Sigfox network transmission is directed\
    \ from\nthe endpoint to the base station, communication will be better. Although\
    \ it helps to have\nbidirectional capabilities, the power from the station to\
    \ the endpoint is limited because it\ndelivers lower downlink width than the uplink\
    \ width.\n7.3. Tempreporter\nThe HACCP is utilized to monitor temperature 24/7.\
    \ Besides, it automatically records\nmeasurements. It also automatically ﬁlls\
    \ the values in the report. The Health Product Reg-\nulatory Authority (HPRA)\
    \ recommends HACCP to monitor the temperature. According\nto a Finistere Ventures\
    \ report, as of 2018, global investment in AgTech was approximately\nUSD 2 billion.\
    \ Numerous assets are expected to cross these numbers in 2022. Considering\nthe\

    \ strategies that help attain sustainable agricultural develop-\nment by 2030.\
    \ However, the latest statistical data issued by the WHO do not look favorable\n\
    for sustainability. This plan shows that more than 800 million people globally\
    \ face food\nshortages, which is one out of every nine people in the world [185].\
    \ To address these issues,\nthe overall grain production needs to be increased.\
    \ Additionally, cash crops need to be\nincreased to meet industrial requirements\
    \ such as rubber and cotton. Most signiﬁcantly,\nthe demand for bioenergy, such\
    \ as ethanol, will also increase by 2030.\nThis review outlines the main issues\
    \ that agriculture would face by 2050. This review\nessentially addresses two\
    \ main questions. How do the advanced technologies help to: (1)\nfeed about 10\
    \ billion people? and (2) increase agricultural production without occupying\n\
    more agricultural land? Moreover, these issues bring several challenges, such\
    \ as the\nreduction in agricultural manpower, the decreasing arable land area,\
    \ the shortage of water\nresources, the impact of climate change, etc. As the\
    \ world shifts towards urbanization,\nnot only is the population of rural areas\
    \ declining, but it is also rapidly aging. As a\nresult, young farmers are required\
    \ to step up to take liability. Population imbalances\nand generational transfers\
    \ will have a serious impact not only on the rural agricultural\nmanpower but\
    \ also on-farm management. Besides, while arable land is diminishing, many\nlands\
    \ are only appropriate for select crops due to certain geographical and environmental\n\
    constraints. Besides, climate change has begun to affect almost all crops. These\
    \ variations\nare anticipated to intensify many existing long-term ecological\
    \ difﬁculties, such as turf,\nﬂoods, soil degradation, groundwater depletion,\
    \ and more.\nCompared with developed nations, more than 50% of the populations\
    \ of developing\nnations are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. Still,\
    \ they are far behind developed\ncountries in terms of quantity and quality. The\
    \ population of developed countries, which\nis less than 2%, is performing much\
    \ better. This difference is evident because Australia, the\nUS, and most European\
    \ countries have adopted improved tools and methods. Over the\npast ﬁfty years,\
    \ they have adopted improved instruments and techniques to increase crop\nproduction.\
    \ These differences demonstrate that advanced technology and sophisticated\napproaches\
    \ make the farm more productive and ecologically sound.\nIt is expected that the\
    \ future of agriculture will develop into a progressive sector\nwhen integrated\
    \ systems appreciate artiﬁcial intelligence and big data capabilities. These\n\
    integrated systems will combine several agricultural types of equipment, tools,\
    \ and tech-\nniques applicable for various agricultural management from sowing\
    \ to yield forecasting.\nAdvanced machines, such as robots of agriculture, cloud\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nand big data, can usher in a different era\
    \ of super-convergence in the farming sector. Here\nare crucial tools and techniques\
    \ that need to be applied for sustainable agriculture in the\nfuture.\n8.1. Smartphone\
    \ and the IoT\nInformation communication technologies such as smartphones and\
    \ the IoT can change\nagriculture in developing countries by facilitating access\
    \ to markets and providing problem-\nsolving information. These technologies can\
    \ also bridge the rural–urban gap, including the\nnext generation of growers.\
    \ Most agricultural-related smartphone services in developing\ncountries have\
    \ provided simple functions due to the limitations of available delivery\ntechnologies\
    \ [79–81]. Fast-moving smartphones and the IoT may soon change by giving\nmany\
    \ opportunities for developing complex services. Today, users can use a wide variety\n\
    of devices to spread more complex information. Simultaneously, smartphones and\
    \ the\nIoT have become increasingly popular and interconnected through expanded\
    \ smartphone\nnetworks, allowing for the collection and processing of large amounts\
    \ of data to help\nagricultural farming and the establishment of social networks\
    \ for information exchange\nand learning.\nThis article discusses relevant knowledge\
    \ and implications, but further study is\nrequired to assess how the latest tools\
    \ and technologies can be practically used to support\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n22 of 31\nagriculture in developing nations. For example, what challenges\
    \ exist and what is needed\nto eliminate them? The smartphone and IoT technology\
    \ developers also need to ensure\nthat their services continue to meet a wide\
    \ range of user needs, rather than concentrating\ntoo much on new machinery that\
    \ may not be available to limited resource underserved\ngrowers.\n8.2. The IoT\
    \ and Wireless Sensors (IoTWS)\nInstalling IoTWS appropriately across farmland\
    \ can provide growers with the latest\nknowledge and information and enable them\
    \ to change accordingly, which helps enhance\ncrop yields. For sustainable agriculture,\
    \ the IoT can be core and forefront for farming\noperations. This comprises the\
    \ efﬁcient use of electricity, water, transportation of crops,\nalerts for the\
    \ maintenance and operation of agriculture machinery, and updated market\nprices.\
    \ It can simplify and streamline these tasks by identifying crop requirements\
    \ at each\nstep. It has proven to be advanced and will provide farmers with unprecedented\
    \ control\nover land and assets, thereby further changing our perceptions of various\
    \ agricultural\nactivities to maximize their efﬁciency and effectiveness. Besides,\
    \ the upcoming Internet\ntechnology can be formed by signiﬁcant improvements in\
    \ wireless sensor networks and 5th\ngeneration (5G) of smartphone communication\
    \ technology, providing growers important\nupdates in real-time and anywhere.\
    \ Based on recent successes, by 2021, it is assessed\nthat there will be more\
    \ than 75 million internet technology-based devices working in the\nagriculture\
    \ sector. Furthermore, the average farm is expected to produce 4.1 million data\n\
    points regularly by 2050 [186].\n8.3. Communication\nThe actual achievement of\
    \ the IoT in farming depends mostly on increased connectivity.\nFrom a telecommunications\
    \ perspective, connectivity and more value-added essential\nservices have a vast\
    \ perspective and can signiﬁcantly affect the whole chain [187]. Almost\nall telecommunication\
    \ operators worldwide provide connectivity facilities, but such public\nservices\
    \ represent only a small portion of the total advanced agriculture market. Given\
    \ its\nworth, especially in remote regions, smartphone operators must offer a\
    \ range of the latest\nservices to fulﬁll growers’ needs. Accepting the truth\
    \ that most people in the community\nare not highly educated, and, therefore,\
    \ they do not fully understand new technologies,\noperators must give end-to-end\
    \ resolutions, not only connectivity. Therefore, it will enhance\nthe market share\
    \ of smartphones and telecommunication operators. Peters [119,188]\nconsidered\
    \ 23 experiments mainly in developing countries and concluded that cellular\n\
    services and smartphone technology had brought a bright future to small farmers\
    \ capable\nof increasing yields. It is very important to give crucial connectivity\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector.\n8.4. Drones and Other Robots\nFarmers and growers\
    \ use UAVs to evaluate crop growth and monitor biodiversity\nand ecological landscape\
    \ features [189]. Additionally, considering the rugged farmland,\nparticularly\
    \ when the farmers have to grow crops on the rugged landscape, UAVs can\neffectively\
    \ be used for water spraying and other pesticides. Compared with traditional\n\
    machinery, with the same propose, robots and drones have conﬁrmed they are worth\n\
    spraying with haste and accuracy. With the latest improvements in swarm technology\
    \ and\ntask-based control, multiple sets of robots and drones armed with diverse\
    \ devices such as\n3D cameras can work together to give growers inclusive land\
    \ management capabilities.\nIn addition to drones, robotics in the agricultural\
    \ sector have increased productivity and\nbrought higher crop production. Robots,\
    \ for weeding and spraying, are decreasing the use\nof pesticides.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n23 of 31\n8.5. Machine Learning and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are utilized to mine data\
    \ for\ntrend analysis. For example, in agriculture, ML/AI is applied to explore\
    \ which genes\nare very appropriate to produce high-yield crops. This gives farmers\
    \ worldwide better\nvarieties of seeds that are suitable for the location and\
    \ climate. On the other hand, ML/AI\nalgorithms have demonstrated which goods\
    \ are in great demand and which goods are not\naccessible in the market. Thus,\
    \ for growers, this gives valuable information for upcoming\nfarming. The latest\
    \ advances in ML/AI will make it possible for growers to correctly\nclassify their\
    \ crop products and eliminate fewer advantageous products before they start\n\
    planting.\n8.6. Energy Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrid, and Smart Grid\n\
    Despite technological advances in agriculture, advanced farming still faces many\n\
    issues that hinder the extended use of the IoT. One of the notable issues regarding\
    \ en-\nergy/power consumption is that advanced agriculture needs extensive energy.\
    \ The major\nproblems for a large amount of energy consumption include the long-term\
    \ deployment\nof sensors, repeated transmission of sensing information by general\
    \ packet radio service,\nand GPS use. Traditionally, growers in rural areas have\
    \ randomly bought and used renew-\nable energy at high prices, which has largely\
    \ restricted their use for advanced agriculture.\nHowever, to resolve the energy\
    \ problem, in the long run, an in-depth analysis of the power\nsource (such as\
    \ remote information communication) can address the problem to some\nextent. In\
    \ addition, smart grids and microgrids enable the perfect integration of distributed\n\
    energy sources (DER), so they have attracted farmers’ adoption. The advent of\
    \ smart\nmeters has made farmers more conﬁdent in investing in DER, particularly\
    \ because farmers\ncan select full excess electricity to the grid. If a continuous\
    \ energy source is not available for\nusers in remote areas, alternative rechargeable\
    \ devices or thermal/electrical/mechanical\nenergy storage systems should be available\
    \ for them to use. Current advances in energy\nstorage apparatus, heating system,\
    \ and electricity will further make DER smarter to grow-\ners. They will be able\
    \ to store energy and use the heat created via heating and cooling when\nrequired\
    \ [190,191]. Moreover, requirements of healthy investment and public awareness\n\
    are two other obstacles to the success of these resolutions.\n8.7. Vertical Farming\
    \ and Hydroponics\nIn addition to adopting advanced technologies, new agricultural\
    \ practices are also crit-\nical to overcoming geographical and resource constraints.\
    \ While arable land is decreasing,\nit is assumed that 3 million people worldwide\
    \ have shifted to urban areas, putting more\nstress on existing limited city resources\
    \ [192]. Contemplating this quick migration, it is\nprojected that before 2030,\
    \ 60% of the world population will rely on urban areas, and these\nﬁgures are\
    \ expected to increase to 68% before 2050 [3,193]. Considering these two issues,\n\
    food production may be disastrous as soon as current agricultural practices are\
    \ concerned.\nVF solves these problems because it can meet the challenges of shortage\
    \ of water and land\nmanagement, and at the same time, it seems very appropriate\
    \ for adoption near urban\nareas or cities. At least in some parts of the world,\
    \ VF is depicted as the solution to food\nshortages and shrinking arable land.\
    \ Besides, hydroponics can play a very important role,\nas it greatly reduces\
    \ the need for space and water. The rapid growth of technologies has\npromoted\
    \ water and nutrient efﬁcient farming, such as VF, making it more attractive to\n\
    farmers. Alongside hydroponics and VF, the latest and improved solutions are needed\
    \ to\nboost the arable land without disturbing forests and natural animal habitats.\
    \ To accomplish\nthis, it is necessary to focus on the desert, because it covers\
    \ a third of the Earth’s land\nsurface. With Norwegian and Chinese companies/experts\
    \ working in the deserts of Dubai,\nQatar, Jordan, and China, solutions have begun\
    \ to be developed [194–196]. The existence\nof advanced technologies, such as\
    \ the IoT, is critical to achieving this target.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n\
    24 of 31\n9. Conclusions\nDue to the continuous increase in the world population,\
    \ the demand for food in-\ncreases. Consequently, forests and arable lands are\
    \ changing into urban landscapes. In the\ncontext of shrinking arable land area,\
    \ highly efﬁcient and advanced technologies need to\nmeet a growing world population’s\
    \ food demands. At present, people can easily see the\ndevelopment of advanced\
    \ approaches to enhance crop yield and improve other agriculture\nmeasures. Some\
    \ people with a lack of innovative spirit and technology take agriculture\nas\
    \ a profession. Although they have partnerships and collaboration among suppliers,\n\
    farmers, retailers, and buyers, there is a gap between them for proper communication.\n\
    To ﬁll this gap, there is an urgent need for innovative and advanced technologies.\
    \ This\nreview covers multiple aspects of technology used in agriculture and enlightens\
    \ the key\nrole of advanced technologies, particularly the IoT, to advance agriculture\
    \ to meet future\nexpectations. Moreover, other advanced technologies, such as\
    \ UAVs, remote and ground\nsensors, communication technologies, and cloud computing,\
    \ are needed for sustainable\nagriculture. This review provides deeper insights\
    \ into the latest research ﬁndings. Based\non all of the above important information,\
    \ it is concluded that there is a dire need for crop\nproduction and improvement.\
    \ However, implementing these advanced and innovative\ntechnologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, are genuinely indeed not optional. By adopting these ad-\nvanced technologies,\
    \ farmers will improve their agricultural resources and practices. The\nadvancement\
    \ in such advanced technologies will pave the path for sustainable agriculture.\n\

    \ in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nIn recent years,\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques have achieved signiﬁcant attention in agriculture.\
    \ It is applied in agriculture to plan the\nseveral activities and missions properly\
    \ by utilising limited resources with minor human interference. Currently, plant\
    \ cultivation\nusing new agriculture methods is very popular among the growers.\
    \ However, the aeroponics is one of the methods of modern\nagriculture, which\
    \ is commonly practiced around the world. In the system, plant cultivates under\
    \ complete control conditions in\nthe growth chamber by providing a small mist\
    \ of the nutrient solution in replacement of the soil. The nutrient mist is ejected\n\
    through atomization nozzles on a periodical basis. During the plant cultivation,\
    \ several steps including temperature, humidity,\nlight intensity, water nutrient\
    \ solution level, pH and EC value, CO2 concentration, atomization time, and atomization\
    \ interval\ntime require proper attention for ﬂourishing plant growth. Therefore,\
    \ the object of this review study was to provide signiﬁcant\nknowledge about early\
    \ fault detection and diagnosis in aeroponics using intelligent techniques (wireless\
    \ sensors). So, the farmer\ncould monitor several paraments without using laboratory\
    \ instruments, and the farmer could control the entire system\nremotely. Moreover,\
    \ the technique also provides a wide range of information which could be essential\
    \ for plant researchers and\nprovides a greater understanding of how the key parameters\
    \ of aeroponics correlate with plant growth in the system. It oﬀers\nfull control\
    \ of the system, not by constant manual attention from the operator but to a large\
    \ extent by wireless sensors.\nFurthermore, the adoption of the intelligent techniques\
    \ in the aeroponic system could reduce the concept of the usefulness of\nthe system\
    \ due to complicated manually monitoring and controlling process.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Agriculture has an ancient history nearly dates back to\nthousands of years. Moreover,\
    \ its advancement has been\npushed by implementing the several new systems, practices,\n\
    technologies, and approaches with the time. It employs over\none-third of the\
    \ global workforce [1]. The agriculture is the\nbackbone of an economy for many\
    \ countries and executes a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the development of the\
    \ economy\nfor underdeveloped countries. Besides, it steers the process\nof economic\
    \ prosperity in developed countries. Several\nresearch studies concluded that\
    \ overall world agriculture uses\napproximately seventy percent per year available\
    \ fresh water\nto irrigate only seventeen percent of the land. Another side,\n\
    the total available irrigated land is gradually decreasing due\nto the rapidly\
    \ increasing of food requirements and eﬀects of\nglobal warming [2, 3]. In other\
    \ words, agriculture is dealing\nwith new main signiﬁcant challenges. Foote [4]\
    \ said FAO\nreported that world food production must be increased by\nseventy\
    \ percent to provide suﬃcient food production for\nthe fast-growing population\
    \ and urbanisation. The expected\nworld population growth for the half of the\
    \ present century\nis daunting. However, depending on the estimate, it could\n\
    be expected to rise above the nine billion people by midcen-\ntury. As many studies\
    \ reported that the population is increas-\ning very fast, the global population\
    \ was one billion in 1800,\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume 2018, Article\
    \ ID 8672769, 18 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8672769\nand it increased\
    \ to seven billion people in 2012. However,\nstudies report feared that at the\
    \ end of the current century,\nit could be expected to reach eleven billion people\
    \ and there\ncould be many, many more mouths to feed soon. Thus, the\nrapid increase\
    \ of the population, alongside the decrease in\nagriculture land, intensiﬁcation\
    \ of global climate changes,\nand exacerbation of water resources, declines labour\
    \ force\nand energy crunches are posing tremendous challenges and\nhurdles to\
    \ the agriculture sector [5, 6]. Furthermore, the\ndeveloping and developed countries\
    \ will deal with substantial\nwater crises and issues due to rapid urbanisation\
    \ and indus-\ntrialisation. The available fresh water for irrigated agriculture\n\
    land is supposed to decrease in future [7, 8]. Besides, the\nunpredictable climate\
    \ changes include extreme weather con-\nditions, intense storms, heat waves, and\
    \ ﬂoods will have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on world agriculture sector. We\n\
    need more production from agricultural systems to meet\nthe growing food demands.\
    \ Otherwise, we will suﬀer from\nfood insecurity problems which will be the biggest\
    \ threat.\nMoreover, Qiu and coworkers [9] revealed that the progress\nof the\
    \ agriculture production is not only signiﬁcant for to\nproducing food to feed\
    \ the population, but it is also essential\nfor the industrial sector. Similarly,\
    \ the agriculture is the main\nsource to produce the raw material for many industrial\
    \ sec-\ntors. Therefore, it must be understood that industrial and\nagricultural\
    \ developments are not alternatives. However,\nboth sectors are complementary\
    \ to each other on the path\nto achieving the food security issues.\nAs the evolution\
    \ of humankind from hunters and gath-\nerers to agrarian societies, the eﬀorts\
    \ have mainly focused\non improving the plant yield and productivity by either\n\
    genetic changes, cultural or husbandry, management prac-\ntices, or by developing\
    \ and introducing plant protection\nmeasures. Accordingly, in the last and present\
    \ century,\npeoples have started exploring the possibilities by adopting\ndiﬀerent\
    \ modern techniques in agriculture. The adoption\nof the precision farming methods\
    \ in agriculture is one of\nthe excellent examples. The purpose is to try and\
    \ mechan-\nise them in agriculture to prevent the crop losses due to\nsudden climatic\
    \ changes, soil-borne diseases, pest attaches,\nand so on. However, many research\
    \ studies have been\nsuggested and reported that problems and challenges of\n\
    agriculture could overcome by adopting the precision farm-\ning methods. At present,\
    \ several countries are increasing\ntheir farming productivities by implementing\
    \ the precision\nfarming methods.\nBaudoin et al. [10] reported that the artiﬁcial\
    \ plant grow-\ning method (e.g., greenhouse and factory farms) is one of the\n\
    fundamental types of precision agriculture. Nowadays, the\nmethod is receiving\
    \ importance and gaining the intention\nof the growers. The method can provide\
    \ suﬃcient food\nsupply throughout the year. In the system, the plant grows\n\
    around the year by artiﬁcially adjusting and controlling\nthe surrounding environmental\
    \ conditions such as tempera-\nture, CO2 (carbon dioxide), humidity, light intensity,\
    \ airﬂow,\nand nutrients supply within the conﬁned facilities [11, 12].\nBesides,\
    \ the system minimises environmental impact and\nmaximises the crop yield with\
    \ signiﬁcant results as compared\nwith traditional (open-ﬁeld) cultivation system\
    \ [13]. Savvas\nand team [14] informed that at present soilless plant cultiva-\n\
    tion is one of the most disruptive inventions ever presented\nin the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial\
    \ plant growing system. The soilless sys-\ntem refers to plant cultivation techniques\
    \ without the use of\nsoil by providing artiﬁcial solid material or water nutrient\n\
    solution as a growing medium instead of soil. However, the\nwater culture is related\
    \ to the process of hydroponic and\naeroponic plant cultivation (Figure 1). In\
    \ both methods, the\nroots of the plant are continuously or intervalley nurtured\n\
    with or within water nutrient solution by providing a spe-\nciﬁc control environment\
    \ in artiﬁcial supporting structure\n[16, 17]. Both methods provide many beneﬁts\
    \ to the grower\nsuch as full control of nutrient concentration and supply and\n\
    prevention of many soil-borne diseases and infections to\nplant, thus resulting\
    \ in increased plant yield with signiﬁcant\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\

    \ of available\nnatural resources [18, 19].\nSeveral studies reported aeroponic\
    \ and hydroponic\nsystems as a modern and innovative plant cultivation tech-\n\
    niques under the soilless system. By adopting these tech-\nniques, the growing\
    \ food crises could be resolved [20, 21].\nMoreover, the hydroponic system to\
    \ grow initially leafy\ngreen vegetables was the ﬁrst to emerge, which started\
    \ taking\ncommercial exploitation routes in industrialised countries in\nwest\
    \ and east but eventually was found to have particular\ndefects and problems that\
    \ forced people to discover and\nexperiment with newer variations and techniques\
    \ like the\naeroponic system. According to the NASA report, the aero-\nponic system\
    \ could reduce water, nutrient, and pesticide\nusage by 98, 60, and 100 percent,\
    \ respectively, and increase\nthe plant yield by 45 to 75 percent [22].\nThe primary\
    \ motivation of this review article is to pro-\nvide an idea about the use of\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques\nin the aeroponic system. It could provide an\
    \ opportunity\nfor full automation, scalability, anytime-anyplace access\nmonitoring,\
    \ and fault diagnostics in the aeroponic system.\nMoreover, it would be helpful\
    \ for the local farmer and grower\nto provide timely information about rising\
    \ problems and\ninﬂuencing factors for successful plant growth in the aeropo-\n\
    nic system. The farmers could start to understand their crops\nat a micro scale\
    \ and able to communicate with plant through\naccessible technology. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, this is\nthe ﬁrst work to provide a brief review of the use\
    \ of intelligent\nsensor techniques in the aeroponic system. However, the rest\n\
    of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the\ncurrent work in\
    \ the aeroponic system with intelligent sensor\ntechniques. In Sections 3, 4,\
    \ and 5, we present the brief\ndescription about the aeroponic system, application,\
    \ and\nworking protocol of wireless sensor network in the aeroponic\nsystem. Sections\
    \ 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the advantages, future\napplication, application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in agricul-\nture, and conclusion.\n2. Related Work\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant growing technique of modern\nagriculture. Until now,\
    \ it is not entirely implicated among\nthe farmers. Mostly, it is practiced by\
    \ the researchers for\nperforming the experimental studies. Their study reports\n\
    concluded that it could be well accepted in agriculture as\na modern-day plant\
    \ cultivation activity where the modern\nfarmer does not need soil to grow the\
    \ plant. However, the\naeroponic system has some substantial vulnerability like\
    \ a\nfailure of water supply pumps, nutrient distribution line\nand preparation,\
    \ and atomization nozzle clogging, which\nrequire special knowledge and attention\
    \ to avoid damage,\nrapid plant death, and failure of the system [23]. Further-\n\
    more, the integration of the intelligent agriculture techniques\ncould be the\
    \ best solution to avoid or deal with the above-\nmentioned issues without any\
    \ technical expertise. Xiong\nand Qiao [24] reported that the integration of the\
    \ intelligent\nagriculture systems could be an eﬀective approach for solving\n\
    complex problems of agriculture domains. Zhai et al. [25]\nreported that presently,\
    \ several research studies had been\nconducted on the use of intelligent techniques\
    \ in agriculture\nespecially in the last two decades. Besides, several new tech-\n\
    niques and application have been introduced and patented\nto improve the traditional\
    \ agriculture practices. However,\nexperts mainly focused and monitor the climatic\
    \ condition,\nsoil properties, water quality, plant development, livestock\nmanagement,\
    \ and fertilizer application, pesticide applica-\ntion, and illumination control\
    \ through various intelligent\ntechniques [26–32]. Meanwhile, it could be concluded\
    \ that\ntraditional agricultural logistics is improved and upgraded by\nintroducing\
    \ and implementing the several modern technolo-\ngies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ domains [33]. Basnet and\nBang [34] reported that the collecting information\
    \ through\nsensors and communication technology played a vital role\nin improving\
    \ agricultural production. It has shifted agri-\nculture from input-intensive\
    \ to knowledge-intensive, and\nagriculture becomes more networked and decision-making.\n\
    Both small- and large-scale farmer can beneﬁt from intro-\nducing this technique\
    \ into the agriculture value chain, having\ntheir productivity increased, quality\
    \ improved, services\nextended, and costs reduced. It provides insights into various\n\
    issues in the agriculture like weather prediction, crop and\nlivestock disease,\
    \ irrigation management, and supply and\ndemand of agriculture inputs and outputs\
    \ and helps in solv-\ning those problems. Rehman and Shaikh [35] concluded that\n\
    at present, several information technologies including satel-\nlite navigation,\
    \ grid and ubiquitous computing, and sensor\nnetwork are exercised in agriculture.\
    \ However, the applica-\ntion of the sensor network is supporting agriculture\
    \ practices\nand activities in a very positive direction [36, 37]. Zhang and\n\
    coworkers [38] used a sensor network to monitor air tem-\nperature, humidity,\
    \ ambient light, and soil moisture and\ntemperature. Also, the aeroponic system\
    \ is the new applica-\ntion of the soilless agriculture. Besides, several studies\
    \ had\nbeen successfully designed the aeroponic system by using\nvarious information\
    \ technologies approaches such as Tik\nand coworkers [39] designed and implemented\
    \ a wireless\nsensor network to monitor the aeroponic system. They used\ntemperature,\
    \ light intensity, pH, and EC monitoring sen-\nsors. Moreover, the study reported\
    \ that the wireless sensor\nnetwork oﬀers a wide range of information which could\n\
    be required for the horticulturist to provide a greater\nunderstanding of how\
    \ these environmental and nutrient\nparameters are correlated with plant growth.\
    \ The real-time\ninformation obtained from sensor nodes can be utilised to\noptimise\
    \ strategies to control the temperatures and the other\nproperties of the nutrient\
    \ solution. A study by Pala et al. [40]\nproposed an approach to monitor automation\
    \ and early fault\ndetection tools in the aeroponic system through intelligent\n\
    techniques. In the protocol, they designed a highly scalable\naeroponic system\
    \ and coded as aero-pot prototype. They\ndeveloped software based on a genetic\
    \ algorithm to optimise\npower consumption of the aeroponic system. Their study\n\
    concluded that using this software user can deﬁne various\nproperties and virtually\
    \ conﬁgure the aeroponic system.\nThe developed software can allow the user to\
    \ add and remove\nthe lights and pumps and deﬁne consumption of added\ndevices\
    \ with minimum grower eﬀort. Laksono et al. [41]\ndesigned a wireless sensor and\
    \ actuator network for the\n3\nJournal of Sensors\ncontrolling, monitoring, and\
    \ conditioning of an aeroponic\ngrowth chamber. The designed wireless protocol\
    \ was based\non ZigBee technique. They also designed a data transmission\nsystem\
    \ to transfer the data from the database server to\nadministrator through text\
    \ message. The proposed system\nwas based on the sensors, actuators, communication\
    \ system,\nand database server. The experiment results showed that the\nproposed\
    \ wireless protocol based on ZigBee techniques was a\nuseful tool of the wireless\
    \ sensor network to monitor the\naeroponic system. Jonas et al. [42] developed\
    \ an automatic\nmonitoring system to control the environmental and nutri-\nent\
    \ supply of the aeroponic system. The designed wireless\nprotocol was based on\
    \ Arduino development board. Their\nstudy concluded that the proposed system can\
    \ control the\nnutrient atomization frequency based on the root chamber\nmoisture\
    \ content. However, the system can automatically\ntransfer all the gathered information\
    \ to a web server and also\nshare on Twitter. Sani et al. [43] recommended a web-based\n\
    control and monitoring system for the aeroponic system.\nTheir system was composed\
    \ of microcontrollers (using\nArduino IDE program), actuators (two relays include\
    \ atomi-\nzation spray and fan on/oﬀ on speciﬁc time), the sensor (tem-\nperature\
    \ and pH sensor), LDR (light intensity sensor), and\ncommunication modules (GSM/GPRS/3G\
    \ modem). The\npresent study concluded that our proposed design was able\nto monitor\
    \ and measure the temperature, pH, light intensity,\natomization time and interval\
    \ time, and fan activation time\nand interval time in the aeroponic system. The\
    \ proposed\nmethod was able to directly send the real-time information\nfrom the\
    \ sensor to the server via the Internet using GSM.\nAnitha and Periasamy [44]\
    \ designed wireless sensor tech-\nnique to monitor the aeroponic system. The technique\
    \ was\nbased on the ZigBee prototype. The proposed network archi-\ntecture was\
    \ based on temperature, pressure, humidity, water\nlevel, and pH monitoring sensors.\
    \ The sensors transmitted\nthe gathered data to the GSM (Global System for Mobile)\n\
    node or coordinator node, whereas the gateway device was\nused to transfer the\
    \ data to the personal computer. However,\na server was connected to the database\
    \ where the maximum\nand minimum threshold values of pH, water level, and tem-\n\
    perature were ﬁxed. Furthermore, if the monitored value\nreaches above or below\
    \ the threshold values stored in the\ndatabase, thus, the system was able to start\
    \ the alarm sound\nto aware the farmer. Another study in 2016 by Kernahan\nand\
    \ Cupertino [45] invented a system to monitor and control\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ using wireless techniques. They con-\ncluded that a reliable aeroponic system\
    \ provides a wireless\nconnection between its subsystem for the exchange of data\n\
    and commands. The various subsystems manage one or\nmore plants growing atriums\
    \ include nutrient atomization\non hanged roots, maintenance, control of nutrient\
    \ solution\nlevel, the addition of various nutrients, and control of the\nlight\
    \ quantity and cycle. A study by Montoya et al. [46]\ndesigned a wireless sensor\
    \ system to monitor the aeroponic\nsystem. The system protocol was based on the\
    \ Arduino\ndevelopment board. They used analog and digital sensors\nfor monitoring\
    \ temperature, nutrient atomization, EC, and\npH ﬂuctuations and level of nutrient\
    \ solution in the nutrient\nreservoir. In order to acquire data and automation\
    \ system,\nthe two Arduinos were managed in a master-slave conﬁgu-\nration and\
    \ connected to each other through wireless by\nWi-Fi. All the recorded data was\
    \ autosaved in microSD\nmemory and sent to a web page. Their study concluded that\n\
    the proposed protocol could be used for automation and\ncould monitor the aeroponic\
    \ system. Kerns and Lee [47]\nﬁrstly designed and introduced an aeroponic system\
    \ using\nIoT (Internet of things) to automate the system. The pro-\nposed system\
    \ is comprised of a mobile application, service\nplatform, and IoT device with\
    \ sensors (pH balance, tempera-\nture, and humidity). They used Raspberry Pi Zero\
    \ device and\ndesigned a system to monitor and measure the selected\nparameters.\
    \ The gathered data was autosaved into the data-\nbase server by sending an SQL\
    \ query. Their study concluded\nthat the proposed system could help farmers to\
    \ control and\nmonitor the aeroponic system remotely. Furthermore, Karu\n[48]\
    \ also designed and implemented a high-precision system\nfor small-scale aeroponic\
    \ plant cultivation. The system is\nallowed to precisely control the nutrient\
    \ solutions, pH, and\nEC levels and gives data about humidity, temperature, pH,\n\
    and EC concentration and amount of the nutrient solution\nin the reservoir. A\
    \ recent study by Martin and Rafael [49]\nalso proposed and suggested systems,\
    \ methods, and devices\nfor the aeroponic system. Mithunesh et al. [50] proposed\
    \ an\nintelligentcontrolsystem foranaeroponicsystem. Thesystem\nprotocol was based\
    \ on an open-source development board\ncalled Raspberry Pi. Their study concluded\
    \ that the developed\nsystem provides the simple management and high availability\n\
    established by using both the local and global systems. Idris\nand Sani [51] designed\
    \ monitoring and control system for\nthe aeroponic system. They concluded that\
    \ the developed sys-\ntem is able to monitor the aeroponic system working parame-\n\
    ter such as temperature and humidity by sending the data in\nreal time from sensor\
    \ to the display system. Janarthanan\netal.[52]concluded thattheproblemsoftheaeroponicsystem\n\
    could be solved by the use of wireless sensor and actuator\nsystem. It allows\
    \ the user to monitor and interact with the\nsystem through mobile app and a web\
    \ interface. However,\nLiu and Zhang [53, 54] designed an aeroponic system for\n\
    automatic control of water-fertilizer and temperature. They\nconcluded that system\
    \ supplies an experimental platform\nwith features of simple structure and convenient\
    \ control.\n3. The Aeroponic System\nThe aeroponic system is one of the techniques\
    \ of the soilless\nculture, where the plant grows in the air with the assistance\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial support instead of soil or substrate culture. It is an\nair-water\
    \ plant growing technique where lower portions such\nas the roots of the plant\
    \ are hanged inside the growth cham-\nber under complete darkness in controlled\
    \ conditions. How-\never, the upper portions of the plant such as leaves, fruits,\
    \ and\ncrown portion are extending outside the growth chamber.\nUsually, the artiﬁcial\
    \ supporting structure (plastic or thermo-\nfoam) is provided to support and divide\
    \ the plant into two\nparts (roots and leaves). In the system, plant roots are\
    \ openly\nexposed in the air and directly irrigated with a small droplet\nsize\
    \ of the water nutrient at interval basis. The nutrient solu-\ntion is supplied\
    \ through diﬀerent atomization nozzles with or\n4\nJournal of Sensors\nwithout\
    \ high air pressure. Moreover, several studies consid-\nered aeroponics as a modern-day\
    \ agricultural activity which\nis practiced in an enclosed growth chamber under\
    \ entire con-\ntrolled conditions, as it could eliminate the external environ-\n\
    mental factors as compared with traditional agriculture\nactivity. Hence, it is\
    \ no longer dependent on large-scale land\nuse, and it could be set up in any\
    \ place, a building that has\nlifted global climate without considering the current\
    \ climate\nsuch as rainy season and winter [23, 55–59]. Buer et al. [60]\nreported\
    \ that atomization nozzle uses the tiny amount of\nthe water nutrient solution\
    \ and provides an excellent growth\nenvironment for the plant. Zobel and Lychalk\
    \ [61] said it is a\nmodern-day agricultural research tool which provides several\n\
    agricultural research opportunities for a researcher with sig-\nniﬁcant results\
    \ by providing artiﬁcial growth conditions.\nHowever, Table 1 shows the essential\
    \ monitoring and control\nparameters in the aeroponic system. Hessel et al. [62]\
    \ and\nClawson et al. [63] studies discovered that aeroponics con-\ntributes to\
    \ the advances and developments in many areas of\nplant root studies. It provides\
    \ an excellent chance for plant\nresearchers to deeply study the behavior of plant\
    \ root under\ndiﬀerent conditions and without any complications. Until\nnow, many\
    \ researchers had conducted plant root research\nand experimental studies root\
    \ response to drought [64],\neﬀects of diﬀerent oxygen concentrations on plant\
    \ root\ndevelopment [65, 66], root microorganism [67–69], arbuscu-\nlar mycorrhizal\
    \ fungi production [70], and legume-rhizobia\ninteraction [71]. Furthermore, studies\
    \ also practiced the\ntechnique by growing vegetables, fruits, herbs, and medicinal\n\
    root-based plant [72–74] such as tomato, potato, soybean,\nmaize, lettuce, Anthurium\
    \ andreanum, and Acacia mangium\n[15, 59, 75–79].\n3.1. Present Status of the\
    \ Aeroponic System. The aeroponic\nsystem is one of a holistic production management\
    \ method\nin agriculture which promotes and improves agroecosys-\ntem, health,\
    \ and biodiversity. The system has a paramount\nreputation in the horticulture\
    \ department, because of its\nimplications on the economic and technical aspects\
    \ in the\nagriculture. Among all agriculture systems, only the aeropo-\nnic system\
    \ is receiving the full attention of farmers, policy-\nmakers, entrepreneurs,\
    \ and agricultural researchers. The\ngrower could reduce the requirements of chemical\
    \ inputs\nincluding fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other agro-\nchemicals.\
    \ The grower could obtain higher cultivated plant\nyield and quality as compared\
    \ with other growing methods.\nHowever, the aeroponic system is labour-intensive.\
    \ It oﬀers\nmany opportunities for the farmers to increase rural employ-\nment.\
    \ The farmer can grow a plant in their homes by provid-\ning artiﬁcial growth\
    \ environment. Anitha and Periasamy\n[44] reported that nowadays many families\
    \ are practicing\nthe aeroponic system on their terrace. Besides, several coun-\n\
    tries of the world are using aeroponics for making an expan-\nsion in nourishment\
    \ creation managing the monetary issues\nand making the nation naturally amicable\
    \ to have their par-\nticular food supply. While some years ago, the use of the\n\
    aeroponic system was limited almost around the world\n[84]. At present, the system\
    \ is acquiring more attention from\nthe farmers and several countries are being\
    \ eﬀectively\nadopting as an economical and environmentally friendly veg-\netable\
    \ and fruit growing system. However, it is practiced in\nfollowing countries:\
    \ Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bhutan, Bolivia,\nBrazil, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China,\
    \ Canada, Colombia,\nEcuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\n\
    Indonesia, Italy, India, Iran, Japan, Israel, Kenya, Korea,\nMalaysia, Mongolia,\
    \ Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru,\nPhilippines, Poland, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi\
    \ Arabia, South\nAfrica, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Slovakia, Sri Lanka,\n\
    Taiwan,\nThailand,\nUzbekistan,\nand\nVietnam.\nBesides,\nattempts are made to\
    \ represent the system in other countries\nof the world [23].\n3.2. Key Problems\
    \ and Diﬃculties of the Aeroponic System.\nAeroponic cultivation is performed\
    \ in an outdoor and indoor\ninstallation and or in a greenhouse under controlled\
    \ condi-\ntions. It may be carried out within a facility that includes\nthe provision\
    \ of light for plant growth, the centralised deliv-\nery of nutrient solution,\
    \ and electrical power. The growing\nplants are set in a growth chamber and periodically\
    \ soaked\nwith nutrient solution small mist ejecting through atomiza-\ntion nozzle\
    \ (Figure 2). In addition, the aeroponic system\ngives the chance to control the\
    \ entire growth chamber envi-\nronment precisely. The aeroponic system is the\
    \ modern\ntechnique of the agriculture which is still under develop-\nment. Until\
    \ now, limited studies have been performed, and\nconducted studies concluded that\
    \ the system has some prob-\nlems and issues. Studies suggested that aeroponics\
    \ is per-\nformed without soil or any solid media; thus, the main\nobserved problems\
    \ are water and nutrient buﬀer, any fail-\nure of the water pumps, nutrient solution\
    \ distribution and\npreparation, atomization nozzle clogging, and so on, which\n\
    lead to rapid death of the grown plant [40]. Kernahan and\nCupertino [45] reported\
    \ that the aeroponic system provides\nbetter control of the plant growth and nutritional\
    \ availability\nand prevents the plant from various diseases and root rot.\nHowever,\
    \ during plant growth from sowing to harvest time,\nthe methods adopted in the\
    \ aeroponic system require a little\nhand-operated contribution, interference\
    \ regarding physical\npresence, and expertise in domain knowledge of plants, envi-\n\
    ronment control, and operations to maintain and control the\ngrowth of the plant.\n\
    Moreover, there is a requirement to sustain and keep\nretain the nutrient solution\
    \ parameters which include nutri-\nent temperature, pH, and EC concentration in\
    \ a narrow\nrange of preferred values for optimal growth. If these param-\neters\
    \ drift outside the desired range, it will create several\nproblems for plant\
    \ growth. In addition, some supplemental\nparameters can adjust to optimise the\
    \ plant growth further.\nThe additional parameters are atomization time, atomization\n\
    interval time, air temperature, relative humidity, light inten-\nsity, and carbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) concentration which make\nthe system complicated and time-consuming\
    \ with high\nhuman energy and with the higher level of expert training\nand skill\
    \ for operating the system. However, the grower has\nthe responsibility to control\
    \ and monitor the ﬂuctuations\nof the above parameters in the desired range to\
    \ achieve\nthe suitable growth conditions for the speciﬁc plants. A fail-\nure\
    \ to accurately control and monitor the parameters could\n5\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    signiﬁcantly aﬀect the growth of the plant and cause ﬁnan-\ncial loss. If any\
    \ component failure occurs while the operator\nis not present on site, it may\
    \ be detected too late to prevent\nharm, because systems generally include some\
    \ automated\nmeans for periodically providing nutrient mist to the plant\nroots,\
    \ reﬁlling a nutrient reservoir, and managing light cycles\nand intensity. Therefore,\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation consid-\nered hitherto to be somewhat unsuitable for\
    \ the local grower\nand due to the above reasons and it is not common to\nﬁnd\
    \ an installation. However, the main reason for the low\nacceptability of the\
    \ aeroponic system is not a cost, but the\nmain drawback is the amount of attention\
    \ required of the\ngrower with a high level of expertise and judgment. For the\n\
    above-discussed reasons, more sophisticated and advanced\nmonitoring techniques\
    \ have implemented in the aeroponic\nsystem for early fault detection, real-time\
    \ monitoring, and\ncontrol and automation of the system. Hence, it would be\n\
    advantageous to use artiﬁcial intelligent tools (Figure 3) in\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ to detect fault and diagnosis problems\non time. Thus, it could help to avoid\
    \ rapid damages to grown\nplants and help to fully automate the aeroponic system.\n\
    4. The Aeroponic System and Sensor Network\nIn recent years, early fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis using an\nintelligent agricultural monitoring system is considered\
    \ as\nthe best tool to monitor plant without any complicated oper-\nations and\
    \ laboratory analysis which required domain exper-\ntise and extensive time. The\
    \ development of these convenient\nfeatures has attracted much attention in the\
    \ agriculture.\nThe system is based on a wireless sensor network which\ncomprises\
    \ of a data server, a wireless convergence node,\na plurality of wireless routers,\
    \ and a plurality of wireless sen-\nsor nodes. However, the wireless sensor nodes\
    \ are used as the\nTable 1: Basic monitoring and control parameters in the aeroponic\

    \ monitoring system\nand are used to collect each selected parameter of farming\n\
    operations to be monitored. Park et al. [85] stated that wire-\nless sensor network-based\
    \ systems could be a signiﬁcant\nmethod to fully automate the agriculture system,\
    \ because\nthe sensors provide real-time signiﬁcant information and\nbelieved\
    \ to eliminate the considerable costs of just wiring.\nAnother study by Kim [86]\
    \ said that in agriculture, sensor\nnetwork technique helps to improve existing\
    \ systems\ninstalled in the greenhouse eﬃciently and smoothly by for-\nwarding\
    \ real-time collected information to the operator\nthrough the radio signals.\
    \ The system optimises the trans-\nmission protocols more accurate and quick and\
    \ maximises\nthe application of energy to save the energy and reduce the\nconsumption.\
    \ Pala and team [40] suggested that the utilisa-\ntion of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques in the aeroponic sys-\ntems could lead not only to ﬁnd early fault\
    \ detection but also\nto fully automate the system without any or small interven-\n\
    tions of human operators. The aeroponic system could gain\nmore popularity among\
    \ local farmers by deploying this tech-\nnique in a system for monitoring and\
    \ controlling purpose.\nHowever, it will conserve resources and minimise impacts\n\
    on the environment. The farmers could start to understand\ntheir crops at a micro\
    \ scale and able to communicate with\nplant through accessible technology. Therefore,\
    \ in this arti-\ncle, we explored how wireless sensing technologies wove into\n\
    the aeroponic system. Thus, the primary motivation of this\nreview article was\
    \ to provide an idea about diﬀerent intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools\
    \ used for early fault detec-\ntion and diagnosis for plant cultivation in the\
    \ aeroponic\nsystem (Figure 4). Additionally, it would be helpful for the\nlocal\
    \ farmer and grower to provide timely information about\nrising problems and inﬂuencing\
    \ factors for successful plant\ngrowth in the aeroponic system. The adoption of\
    \ the intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools could reduce the concept\nof\
    \ unsuitable for the amateur.\n4.1. Number of Sensor Nodes and Input Parameters.\
    \ At pres-\nent, the utilisation of diﬀerent sensor techniques is almost\npossible\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the sharp progressions in\nthe currently available\
    \ technologies. Moreover, the sensor is\na device that has capabilities to measure\
    \ physical attributes\nand convert them into signals for the observer [87]. A\
    \ WSN\n(wireless sensor network) traditionally consists of a few to\ndozens and\
    \ in some cases thousands of the sensor nodes\nwhich are connected to one or more\
    \ sensors [88]. Generally,\nit includes a BS (base station), which acts as a gateway\
    \ between\nthe WSN and the end users. Each sensor node is consisting of\nﬁve main\
    \ components, which are a microcontroller unit, a\ntransceiver unit, a memory\
    \ unit, a power unit, and a sensor\nunit [89]. Each one of these components is\
    \ a determinant in\ndesigning a WSN for deployment. Furthermore, the micro-\n\
    controller unit is in charge of the diﬀerent tasks, data process-\ning, and the\
    \ control of the other components in the node [88].\nThrough the transceiver unit,\
    \ a sensor mode performs its\ncommunication with other nodes and other parts of\
    \ the\nWSN. It is the most dominant communication unit. The\nmemory unit is another\
    \ important part of the WSN system,\nwhich is used to store the observed data.\
    \ The memory unit\ncould be RAM, ROM, and their other memory types ﬂash or\neven\
    \ external storage devices such as USB. Lastly, the last\none unit is the power\
    \ unit. It is one of the critical components\nof the system which is for node\
    \ energy supply. However, the\npower unit could be any source; it can store in\
    \ batteries (most\ncommon) rechargeable or not on in capacitors. In addition,\n\
    for extra power supply and recharging the power unit, the\navailable natural resource\
    \ could be used. The natural sources\ninduce solar power energy in forms of photovoltaic\
    \ panels\nand cells, wind power energy with turbines, kinetic energy\nfrom water,\
    \ and so on. Last but not the least is the sensor unit,\nwhich includes several\
    \ sensors for parameter measurements\nsuch as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand carbon monoxide [90]. However, in the aeroponic sys-\ntem, the\
    \ total required number of sensors and actuators\ndepends on the size and requirement\
    \ of the operator.\n4.2. Sensor Types and Monitoring Parameters. In this review\n\
    study, we reviewed the previous work done on the aeroponic\nsystem using wireless\
    \ sensor network technique. We found\nthat the primary objective of a wireless\

    \ and Lee [47].\n7\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem for the aeroponic system is to\
    \ control the growth\nchamber climatic condition as per the crop data sheet. How-\n\
    ever, the basic principle of the aeroponic system is to grow\nthe plant by suspending\
    \ in the closed, semiclosed, or dark\nenvironment in the air with artiﬁcial provided\
    \ support. In\nthe system, the plant stems, leaves, and any fruit grow in a\n\
    vegetative zone above the suspension medium, and roots\ndangle below the suspension\
    \ medium in an area commonly\nreferred as a root zone [46]. Generally, closed\
    \ cell foam is\ncompressed around the lower stem and inserted into an\nopening\
    \ in the aeroponic growth chamber, which decreases\nlabour and expense. However,\
    \ the trellising is used to sus-\npend the weight of cultivated plant [44]. Ideally,\
    \ the environ-\nment is kept free from pests and diseases so that the plants\n\
    grow healthier and more quickly than other plants grown\non techniques. Furthermore,\
    \ the key to the success and high\nyields of the air gardening is a scientiﬁc\
    \ grade monitoring of\nthe conditions and accurate control of the growing environ-\n\
    ment. Each plant yields and needs a diﬀerent environmental\ncondition for growth.\
    \ However, the plant growth is mainly\ninﬂuenced by the surrounding environmental\
    \ and climatic\nvariables and the amount of water and the fertilizers supplied\n\
    by irrigation. There is a requirement to monitor and control\nliquid nutrient\
    \ parameters in a narrow range of preferred\nvalues for optimal growth. The parameters\
    \ include nutrient\ntemperature, pH, and EC concentration. If the parameters\n\
    drift outside the desired range, the plants can harm. Besides,\nthere are some\
    \ additional parameters which can be adjusted\nto further optimise growth, such\
    \ as air temperature, relative\nhumidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2) concen-\ntration. Idris and Sani [51] reported that the one solution to\n\
    solve the problems of monitoring and controlling the grow-\ning conditions in\
    \ the space environment is by applying some\nsensors. The sensor can detect and\
    \ monitor a number of\nparameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity,\n\
    O2 and CO2 levels, direction, and wind speed. Aside from\nthe sensors, there is\
    \ also a requirement for the actuators to\ndistribute nutrients and waters to\
    \ plant roots or lower stems\n(Figure 5). The sensor collects the information\
    \ of the various\nenvironmental conditions and forwards the signals to the\nactuator\
    \ to take place and produce the outcome for the col-\nlected information to know\
    \ the status of that parameter.\nThe actuator can control the environment changes.\
    \ The sen-\nsors store information that analyzes the environment and\nidentiﬁes\
    \ the location, object, people, and their situations.\nThe sensor provides multiple\
    \ contributions in various\ndomains that depend on a variety of attribute and\
    \ variant\nin time [87, 91, 92].\n4.2.1. Temperature Sensor. In the aeroponic\
    \ system, the\ntemperature is one of the critical factors signiﬁcantly\ndetermining\
    \ plant growth and development. A reduction\nin temperature below the optimal\
    \ conditions often results\nin suboptimal plant growth. A diﬀerent cultivar requires\n\
    a diﬀerent temperature level for the photosynthesis process\nand growth, which\
    \ can advance the plant growth stage. It\nwill eventually bring us substantial\
    \ economic beneﬁts. In\nthe aeroponic system, the optimum growth chamber tem-\n\
    perature should not be less and more than 4 and 30°C,\nrespectively, for successful\
    \ plant growth. The temperature\nﬂuctuations of aeroponic growth chamber can signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect the root growth, respiration, transpiration, ﬂowering,\nand dormant period\
    \ [93]. Therefore, the temperature sensors\ncan be used to monitor the temperature\
    \ ﬂuctuations of the\naeroponic system. At present, temperature sensors are used\n\
    in many applications like environmental controls, food pro-\ncessing units, medical\
    \ devices, and chemical handling. The\ntemperature sensor is a device mainly composed\
    \ of thermo-\ncouple or resistance temperature detector. The temperature\nsensor\
    \ measures the real-time temperature reading through\nMobile phone\nPC\nInternet\n\

    \ the data about tem-\nperature from a particular source and convert the data\
    \ into\nan understandable form for a device or an observer. The\ntemperature\n\
    sensor\naccurately\nmeasures\ntemperatures\nslower changing from critical applications\
    \ such as facilities\nor rooms and sends them to the user’s webpage.\n4.2.2. Humidity\
    \ Sensor. Aeroponics is the technique of culti-\nvating plant by providing the\
    \ water nutrient small spray in\nthe air. Thus, the humidity is another important\
    \ parameter\nof aeroponic growth chamber environments, and its control\nis recognised\
    \ to be very important for signiﬁcant plant\ngrowth. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ the plant gets all available\nmoisture in the growth chamber. Moreover, if the\
    \ growth\nchamber has too high or less moisture content, both condi-\ntions will\
    \ create many problems for the plant. Accordingly,\nan accurate and precise means\
    \ of testing moisture content\nin the growth chamber will help farmers to monitor\
    \ their\ncrops and provide a suitable growth environment for the\nplant. Wang\
    \ et al. [94] reported that a humidity sensor is a\ndevice that detects and measures\
    \ water vapour present in\nthe air within a room or enclosure. At present, humidity\
    \ sen-\nsors are widely used in medicine, agriculture, and environ-\nmental monitoring.\
    \ However, the most commonly used\nunits for humidity measurement are relative\
    \ humidity [95].\nThe development of humidity sensors has shown remarkable\nprogress\
    \ because of using various types of sensing materials in\nrecent years. The sensing\
    \ materials used in humidity sensors\ncan classify into ceramics, polymers, and\
    \ composites [96].\nThe humidity sensor could be placed in the growth chamber\n\
    to maintain the moisture level. If the moisture level becomes\nless than the plant\
    \ requirement, the sensors will forward the\nsignals to atomization nozzles to\
    \ perform their work.\n4.2.3. Light Intensity Sensor. As we know, all vegetable\
    \ plants\nand ﬂowers require large amounts of sunlight, and each plant\ngroup\
    \ reacts diﬀerently and has the diﬀerent physiology to\ndeal with light intensity.\
    \ Some plant performs well in low\nlight intensity and some in high light intensity.\
    \ However,\nthe aeroponic system implements in indoor conditions, so\nit is necessary\
    \ for the farmer to provide suﬃcient light quan-\ntity of at least 8 to 10 hours\
    \ for a day to grow the healthy\nplant. The artiﬁcial lighting is a better option\
    \ to present\nenough intensity to produce a healthy plant [97, 98]. In the\nconventional\
    \ aeroponic system, the control of the light quan-\ntity present in the growth\
    \ chamber is mostly done by farmer\nthrough observing the plant condition. However,\
    \ it is a time-\nconsuming and challenging task for the farmer to provide the\n\
    required light concentration accurately. It could be a better\noption to use intelligent\
    \ agriculture techniques to monitor\nthe light intensity in the aeroponic system.\
    \ The intelligent\nagriculture techniques mean using the sensor system to con-\n\
    trol the light intensity. The light sensor is an electronic device\nwhich is used\
    \ to detect the presence or nonpresence of light\nand darkness. There are several\
    \ types of light sensors includ-\ning photoresistors, photodiodes, and phototransistors.\
    \ These\nlight sensors distinguish the substance of light in a growth\nchamber\
    \ and increase or decrease the brightness of light to\na more comfortable level.\
    \ Light sensors can be used to auto-\nmatically control the lights such as on/oﬀ.\
    \ By adopting the\nsensor network in aeroponics, the farmer could be able to\n\
    monitor light intensity without any human interference.\nBecause the sensors will\
    \ perform all work such as if the light\nintensity in the growth chamber will\
    \ be less than the required\nlight quantity for plant growth, the sensor will\
    \ automatically\nforward the signal to the LED light to turn on until the light\n\
    quantity reaches to the desired level.\n4.2.4. CO2 Sensor. The appropriate oxygen\
    \ concentration in\nthe root environment is crucial to keep the root metabolism\n\
    in nutrition solution. The available oxygen concentration\nfor the root environment\
    \ is a hugely signiﬁcant factor since\nlow concentrations aﬀect the root respiration,\
    \ nutrient\nabsorption, and, consequently, the plant growth [66]. Thus,\nthe CO2\
    \ sensor could be used to monitor the carbon dioxide\nﬂuctuations in the aeroponic\
    \ growth chamber. A carbon\ndioxide sensor is an instrument which is used for\
    \ the mea-\nsurement of carbon dioxide gas concentration. Bihlmayr\npH sensor\n\

    \ sensors are used to measure indoor\nair quality in a building to perform demand-based\
    \ ventila-\ntion. However, the CO2 sensor data measuring range is in\nbetween\
    \ 500 and 5000 parts per million. There are two main\ntypes of the CO2 sensors\
    \ which include nondispersive infra-\nred carbon dioxide sensors (NICDS) and chemical\
    \ carbon\ndioxide sensors (CCDS), whereas the NICDS detected CO2\nin a gaseous\
    \ environment by its characteristic absorption\nand composed of an infrared detector,\
    \ an interference ﬁlter,\na light tube, and an infrared source. However, the CCDS\
    \ of\nsensitive layers are based on polymer or heteropolysiloxane\nwith low-energy\
    \ consumption [100].\n4.2.5. Water Level Sensor. The aeroponics is the method\
    \ of\nthe plant cultivation by providing a small mist of the nutrient\nsolution\
    \ in the growth chamber. Thus, there is no any use of\nsoil; just water is required\
    \ to cultivate the plant throughout\nthe germination to harvest time. Therefore,\
    \ the water nutri-\nent solution reservoir is one of the major components of\n\
    the aeroponic system which should be monitored throughout\nthe growth period.\
    \ In the conventional aeroponic system, the\nfarmer checks the water nutrient\
    \ level in the nutrient solution\nreservoir, and if he founds water level less\
    \ than the desired\nlevel, he maintained accordingly. However, by adopting the\n\
    precision agriculture techniques, the farmer will be able to\nmonitor and control\
    \ water nutrient level through the intelli-\ngent methods such as wireless sensors.\
    \ The water nutrient\nlevel sensors detect the liquid level in the reservoirs\
    \ and facil-\nitate operator in collecting water nutrient level data in real\n\
    time. The sensors will alert the operator about any potential\nproperty damage\
    \ that results from any leaks and also allow-\ning to know when a container is\
    \ nearing empty.\n4.2.6. EC and pH Sensor. In the aeroponic system, the plant\n\
    productivity is closely related to nutrient uptake and the EC\nand pH regulation\
    \ of the nutrient solution. The EC and pH\nconcentration of the nutrient solution\
    \ aﬀects the availability\nof the nutrients to plants [101]. The pH and EC concentra-\n\
    tions are controlled to prevent barrier growth. Their mea-\nsurement is essential\
    \ because the solubility of minerals in\nacidic, alkaline, and ion concentration\
    \ of all the species in\nsolutions is diﬀerent and the solution concentration\
    \ changes\nwith solubility [102, 103]. The unmonitored EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution will quickly lead to\na situation where plants cannot\
    \ absorb the essential nutri-\nents, if not corrected this will eventually lead\
    \ to harmful\nplant growth and poor productivity. Thus, the EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution is a critical parameter\nto be measured and controlled\
    \ throughout the plant growth.\nMoreover, in the conventional aeroponic system,\
    \ the EC and\npH value of the nutrient solution is mostly monitored manu-\nally\
    \ by performing laboratory analysis or using advanced\nequipment which is a time-consuming\
    \ process. For instance,\nwhen the EC of the nutrient solution decreased or increased,\n\
    the control of nutrient solution concentration is mostly\nachieved by adding more\
    \ high concentration nutrient solu-\ntion or the fresh water, respectively, to\
    \ the nutrient solution\nto maintain the EC level to the prescribed target range.\
    \ Sim-\nilarly, for pH, an acid solution and an alkali solution are used\nto control\
    \ the pH ﬂuctuation of the nutrient solution within a\nspeciﬁed target range [101].\
    \ However, these conventional\nmethods are time-consuming and challenging task\
    \ for the\nfarmer to maintain the EC and pH value at the desired range\naccurately.\
    \ In addition, the EC and pH sensor could be used\nto deal with the above challenges.\n\
    5. Sensor Working Protocol in the\nAeroponic System\nToday, the world demands\
    \ automatic tools to do most of the\nwork for them without bothering its user\
    \ for doing some task.\nSo, the concept is all about a very high level of automation\n\
    system which will be independent of its users to a very great\nextent, reduce\
    \ human eﬀorts, and save all kinds of resource\nutilisation, as monitoring and\
    \ controlling will be done by\ncomputers leaving very few easily manageable tasks\
    \ for\nhumans, and it will interest more people to join this ﬁeld\n[104–106].\
    \ Moreover, the monitoring and control system\nfor the aeroponic system mainly\
    \ consists of following sec-\ntions which include the aeroponic system, data acquisition,\n\
    controlling the equipment, data transmission module, cloud\ndata processing server,\
    \ social communication platform, and\nmobile application. A typical architecture\
    \ of sensor nodes\nfor controlling and monitoring the aeroponic system is\nshown\
    \ in Figure 6. Furthermore, in architecture, the data\nacquisition section refers\
    \ to some sensor nodes used in the\nAeroponic system\nData acquisition\nMobile\
    \ application\nControl and\nmonitoring center\nData transmission\nmodule\nSocial\
    \ platform\nCloud data\nprocessing server\nFigure 6: Schematic protocol of wireless\
    \ network in the aeroponic system.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem to establish\
    \ a data acquisition module. The data\nacquisition module is placed in the aeroponic\
    \ system or near\nthe growth chamber to collect the real-time information\nfrom\
    \ selected parameters (temperature, light intensity,\nhumidity, nutrient solution\
    \ level, atomization quantity, and\nphotos of the growing plants) and transmit\
    \ the gathered data\nto the control and management centre. However, the control\n\
    and management section refers to the central processing unit\n(CPU) of the system.\
    \ The CPU of the system consists of some\nprimary functions such as Arduino and\
    \ WRTnod protocols,\nwhose work is to store, manage gathered data from collection\n\
    nodes, process, and then accurately and automatically send\nto the web server\
    \ in real time [104–109]. Thus, the system\ncan help the farmer and grower to\
    \ monitor and control the\nsmart aeroponic system remotely using the mobile app.\
    \ In\nother words, the plant will be able to talk with the farmer\nthrough a mobile\
    \ app that whether the selected parameters\nare working well or not.\n6. Advantages\
    \ of Sensor Techniques in the\nAeroponic System\nThe continuously increasing food\
    \ demands require rapid\nimprovement and development in the food production\n\
    system. However, to enhance the quality and productivity\nof the cultivated crop,\
    \ peoples are moving towards the mod-\nern plant cultivation technologies in agriculture.\
    \ Thus, the\naeroponics is one of the rising plant growing technologies\nin agriculture\
    \ as a modern-day cultivation technique, where\nthe plant is cultivated in an\
    \ air environment, and no any soil\nsupport is provided. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ a number of the\nparameters are required to control for successful plant\ngrowth\
    \ because there is no any growing medium provided\nto the plant. For example,\
    \ if the plant has some sudden stress\nand the farmer is not present at the site\
    \ that means the plant\nwill die. Therefore, the proper management of the crop\
    \ is\nessential. In the conventional aeroponic system, grower uses\nhis knowledge,\
    \ skills, and judgment to adjust and maintain\nthe parameters such as EC and pH\
    \ meter, minimum and\nmaximum temperature, light intensity, and humidity level\n\
    through several instruments and checks the readings which\nare labour-intensive\
    \ and time-consuming task. To deal with\nthe above problems, the aeroponic system\
    \ can be developed\nwith a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring\n\
    the key parameters at lower labour cost, time, and without\nany technical knowledge.\
    \ The wireless sensor and actuator\nnetwork oﬀer several advantages including\
    \ faster response\nto confrontational climatic conditions and better quality con-\n\
    trol of the crop that produces at a lower labour cost. This\nadvancement in the\
    \ aeroponic system through wireless sen-\nsor network for monitoring growth chamber\
    \ environment\nis beneﬁcial. However, the monitoring system also oﬀers a\nrange\
    \ of information which could be required by plant scien-\ntists or grower to provide\
    \ a greater understanding of how\nthese environmental and nutrient parameters\
    \ correlate with\nplant growth. It is now recognised that plant grower can per-\n\
    fectly and easily acquire the skills needed to operate an aero-\nponic system.\
    \ It provides the full control of the system, not by\nconstant manual attention\
    \ from the operator but to a large\nextent by wireless sensors.\n7. Future Application\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence agriculture techniques are consid-\nered as a high potential,\
    \ improving technique for decision-\nmaking in agriculture. Nowadays, it is quickly\
    \ getting peo-\nples’ intention, more and more visible in our society and\ndynamically\
    \ turning our social awareness and lifestyle. The\ntechniques provide several\
    \ opportunities to monitor the\nplant growth and development from pre- to postharvest.\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant cultivation technology of agri-\nculture which is\
    \ still under development. However, we\nreviewed the literature and found that\
    \ only limited study\nhad been conducted on the implementation of the intelligent\n\
    agricultural techniques in the aeroponic system. Moreover,\nuntil now, most of\
    \ the studies had been designed the aeropo-\nnic system using a wireless sensor\
    \ network using ZigBee and\nArduino system with Bluetooth, global system of mobile\
    \ and\nWi-Fi, and communication modules. During a literature\nsurvey, we noted\
    \ that no any single study had implemented\nthe idea of the cloud computing and\
    \ big data techniques in\naeroponics to collect real-time information via the\
    \ Internet.\nThe techniques provide many advantages to the user such\nas reduction\
    \ of the initial cost, allocation of the resources\non demand, and maintenance\
    \ and upgrade performed in\nthe back-end, easy, and rapid development. The techniques\n\
    present a chance to the operator to stay connected with the\nsystem using mobile\
    \ accessories like a smartphone, tablet,\nand PCs at any location via the Internet\
    \ which is not\nrestricted by conditions, locations, and time. Furthermore,\n\
    the system would be designed using additional artiﬁcial\nintelligence techniques\
    \ such as image processing, automatic\nseedling transplanters, and harvesting\
    \ and packing robots.\nThe purpose of image processing and analysis is to measure\n\
    and identify the physiology, growth, development, nutrient\ndeﬁciencies, diseases,\
    \ and other phenotypic properties of\nthe plants through automated and nondestructive\
    \ analysis.\n8. Application of Artificial Intelligence\nTechniques in Agriculture\n\
    Agriculture is the primitive and ancient application that\nhumans started ﬁrst\
    \ after born on earth. It has an extensive\nhistory between numerous industries\
    \ and very intimately\nlinked to the human development on earth. Moreover, in\n\
    the past, the agriculture sector was labour-intensive, but the\nnext-generation\
    \ farmers, researchers, and associated organi-\nsations proposed and applied new\
    \ farming methods, technol-\nogies, skills, and knowledge in agriculture as a\
    \ modern era to\nreduce labour-intensive task. Presently, the technology is\n\
    considered as a key tool to overcome many challenges and\neases the way how people\
    \ live. In the past, the many problems\nof agriculture, especially in irrigation\
    \ water management,\ncrop yield production, environment predication, and deci-\n\
    sion-making, were decided by many factors. In addition,\nthe fertilization often\
    \ decided by the mathematical equations,\nformulas, or the experiences of the\
    \ experts. The cultivation is\n11\nJournal of Sensors\nrepresented by descriptive\
    \ and causal knowledge, and diag-\nnosis of pests and diseases is represented\
    \ by uncertain knowl-\nedge. Thus, this knowledge and experience are illogically\n\
    incomplete and imprecise, and the traditional procedures\ncan not handle them.\
    \ However, artiﬁcial intelligence has its\nsuperiority. It could be an eﬀective\
    \ approach for solving com-\nplex problems to the levels of experts using imitate\
    \ experts\n[110]. The term artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was developed in\n1956,\
    \ as “the science and engineering of making intelligent\nmachines” [111]. It is\
    \ a abroad discipline, which was devel-\noped for the interaction of several types\
    \ of ﬁelds such as com-\nputer science, information theory, cybernetics, linguistics,\n\
    neurophysiology, and psychology [112]. The main purpose\nof the creation of the\
    \ intelligence techniques is to ﬁnd the\nsolutions for complex problems and to\
    \ work, react, and\nrespond like humans. It performed work better than a well-\n\
    qualiﬁed person and brought positive economic and environ-\nmental results [112,\
    \ 113]. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) tools\nhave helped to predict the behavior\
    \ of nonlinear systems\nand to control variables to improve the operating conditions\n\
    of a system’s environment [114–117]. A recently published\nreport highlighted\
    \ that artiﬁcial intelligence is emerging as\npart of the solutions towards improved\
    \ agricultural produc-\ntivity. The global artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ is\nexpected to grow at a signiﬁcant level. It is employed to\nimprove the eﬃciency\
    \ of daily tasks in agriculture such as\nthe adoption of robots and drones, crop\
    \ health monitoring\nprotocols, automated irrigation system, and driverless trac-\n\
    tors [118]. At present, several research studies have been per-\nformed by implementing\
    \ the artiﬁcial intelligent techniques\nin agriculture. Popa [119] revealed that\
    \ some of the devel-\noped applications for agriculture are expert systems and\
    \ soft-\nware, sensors for collecting and transmitting data, and\nrobotic and\
    \ automation which are adapted from diﬀerent\nindustries into agriculture, whereas\
    \ the expert systems and\nsoftware is the planning process such as strategic or\
    \ opera-\ntional; it has beneﬁted substantially, due to the expansion of\npersonal\
    \ computer and Internet use. The systems are gener-\nated through the structured\
    \ knowledge base and reasoning\nmechanisms acquired from a human expert but with\
    \ an\nenhanced computational power and speed [120]. These sys-\ntems can demarcate\
    \ management zones taking in consider-\nation with relevant factors and able to\
    \ recommend suitable\ncrop rotations, optimal plant density, water requirements,\n\
    appropriate fertilizer use, diagnosing pests and diseases for\ncrops, and suggesting\
    \ preventive or curative measures\n[121]. Huang et al. [122] discussed soft computing\
    \ and appli-\ncations in agriculture. The study reported that soft comput-\ning\
    \ is the combination of the computing technologies, such\nas an artiﬁcial neural\
    \ networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL),\nand genetic algorithms (GAs). These techniques\
    \ are opposed\nto the hard computing method which states to a huge set of\nstochastic\
    \ and statistical methods. The hard computing\nprovides inaccurate solutions and\
    \ results of very complex\nproblems through modelling and analysis with a tolerance\n\
    of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and an approxima-\ntion. However,\
    \ the soft computing techniques are used to\nachieve tractability and robustness.\
    \ It provides a low-cost\nsolution with a tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty,\
    \ partial\ntruth, and approximation [123–127]. Sui and Thomasson\n[128] developed\
    \ a BP-trained feedforward ANNs to predict\nnitrogen status in cotton plants based\
    \ on a data from a\nground-based sensing system. Tumbo and team [129] used\nan\
    \ on-the-go system for sensing chlorophyll status in corn\nusing BP-trained feedforward\
    \ ANNs and ﬁber optic spec-\ntrometry to acquire spectral response pattern data\
    \ in corn\nﬁelds. Tang et al. [130] developed a texture-based weed clas-\nsiﬁcation\
    \ method consisting of a low-level Gabor wavelet-\nbased feature extraction algorithm\
    \ and a high-level ANN-\nbased pattern recognition algorithm. El-Faki and group\n\
    [131] established and tested ANN-based weed detection\nalgorithms capable of detecting\
    \ the leading weed species\ncompeting with wheat and soybean crops. A study by\
    \ Krish-\nnaswamy and Krishnan [132] predicted the nozzle wear rates\nfor four\
    \ fan nozzles using regression and ANN methods.\nPearson and Wicklow [133] developed\
    \ a neural network to\nidentify fungal species that infect single kernels using\
    \ princi-\npal components of the reﬂectance spectra as input features.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [134] developed year-round air temperature pre-\ndiction models for prediction\
    \ horizons from 1 to 12 h using\nfeedforward-style ANNs. Zadeh [123] introduced\
    \ the con-\ncept of fuzzy sets as a mean for describing complex systems\nwithout\
    \ the requirements for precision. Fuzzy logic may also\nbe useful for descriptive\
    \ systems, those that fall somewhere\nbetween hard systems and soft systems, such\
    \ as biology\nand agriculture [135]. Studies reported that in agriculture,\nfuzzy\
    \ logic is used for multicriteria analysis of the image,\nimage classiﬁcation,\
    \ vegetation mapping, assessment of soil\nsuitability, and planning forest harvesting\
    \ [136–143]. Al-\nFaraj and coworkers [144] established a rule-based FL crop\n\
    water stress index (CWSI) using growth chamber data and\ntested this method on\
    \ tall fescue canopies grown in a green-\nhouse. Thomson et al. [145] and Thomson\
    \ and Ross [146]\ndeveloped a coupled sensor- and model-based irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ method. Yang et al. [147, 148] informed on the\ndevelopment of an image capture/processing\
    \ system to\ndetect weeds and a fuzzy logic decision-making system to\ndetermine\
    \ where and how much herbicide to apply in an\nagricultural ﬁeld. Gil and team\
    \ [149] applied multiple linear\nregression and FL inference models to evaluate\
    \ the eﬀects of\nmicrometeorological conditions on pesticide application for\n\
    two spray qualities (ﬁne and very ﬁne). Qiu et al. [150]\nestablished a fuzzy\
    \ irrigation decision-making system using\nvirtual instrumentation platform of\
    \ sensors, test instru-\nments, data logger, and LabVIEW. Generally, published\n\
    studies use on/oﬀ controllers where the inherent complexity\nof irrigation process\
    \ made it diﬃcult to achieve optimal\nresults [151]. Ali et al. [152] developed\
    \ temperature and\nhumidity controller inside the greenhouse using fuzzy logic.\n\
    However, several studies have been conducted to develop\nmany control strategies\
    \ to optimise the greenhouse environ-\nment using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\
    \ such as neural\nnetwork, fuzzy logic controller, adaptive predictive control,\n\
    PID, and nonlinear adaptive PID control [153–159]. Zhu\net al. [160] used the\
    \ remote wireless system for water\nquality online monitoring in intensive aquaculture\
    \ using\nartiﬁcial neural networks. The results demonstrate that\nonline monitoring\
    \ for water quality information could be\n12\nJournal of Sensors\naccurately acquired\
    \ and predicted by using the remote\nwireless system. Mahajan et al. [161] reported\
    \ that agricul-\nture is noteworthy that computer vision applications have\ngrown\
    \ due to reduced equipment costs, increased computa-\ntional power, and increasing\
    \ interest in nondestructive food\nassessment methods. The use of these techniques\
    \ presents\nadvantages when compared with traditional methods based\non manual\
    \ work; however, there are still some challenges\nto be overcome. Moreover, the\
    \ principle of artiﬁcial intel-\nligence in agriculture is one where a machine\
    \ can perceive\nits environment, and through a certain capacity of ﬂexible\nrationality,\
    \ can act to address a speciﬁed goal related to\nthat environment.\n9. Conclusion\n\
    The objective of our study was to present the information\nabout the use of automated\
    \ monitoring and controlling tech-\nnique in the aeroponic system. The aeroponic\
    \ system is the\nnew plant cultivation method of the modern agriculture. Its\n\
    existence can allow producing food whole year without any\ninterval. The system\
    \ could create an excellent set which\nencourages the sustainable city life for\
    \ those peoples who\nwant to live in urban area. Moreover, during plant growth\n\
    from sowing to harvest time, the methods adopted in the\naeroponic system require\
    \ a little hand-operated contribution,\ninterference regarding physical presence,\
    \ and expertise in\ndomain knowledge of plants, environment control, and oper-\n\
    ations to maintain and control the growth of the plant.\nTherefore, the system\
    \ is considered hitherto to be somewhat\nunsuitable for the grower, and due to\
    \ the above reasons, it is\nnot common to ﬁnd an installation. We reviewed the\
    \ litera-\nture and found that implementation of advanced monitoring\ntechnology\
    \ tools in aeroponics could provide an opportunity\nfor the farmer to monitor\
    \ and control several paraments\nwithout using laboratory instruments, and the\
    \ farmer can\ncontrol the entire system remotely. Thus, it could reduce\nthe concept\
    \ of the usefulness of the system due to the com-\nplicated manual monitoring\
    \ and controlling process. The\ntechnology oﬀers incredible opportunities for\
    \ the aeroponic\nsystem to increase the capability, reliability, and availability\n\
    among the farmers and growers. We believe that our review\narticle will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of the advanced mon-\nitoring technology in the aeroponic system.\
    \ However, the\ntechnique provides a range of information which could be\nrequired\
    \ by plant scientists to provide a greater understand-\ning of how these environmental\
    \ and nutrient parameters\ncorrelate with plant growth.\nConflicts of Interest\n\

    \ 2018\nAbstract\nAgriculture faces the challenge of providing food, fibre and\
    \ energy from limited land \nresources to satisfy the changing needs of a growing\
    \ world population. Global megatrends, \ne.g., climate change, influence environmental\
    \ production factors; production and consump-\ntion thus must be continuously\
    \ adjusted to maintain the producer–consumer-equilibrium \nin the global food\
    \ system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is \nthe\
    \ dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for\
    \ the highly \nefficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural\
    \ practice in developed \ncountries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support\
    \ site-specific management is a major \ntrend. Although the most prominent use\
    \ of satellite technology in farming still is naviga-\ntion, Earth Observation\
    \ is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been estab-\nlished,\
    \ which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These ser-\n\
    vices have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral\
    \ imagery from \nNASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively.\
    \ Using mul-\ntispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain.\
    \ Compared to multispec-\ntral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling,\
    \ often referred to as hyperspectral \nsensing, can potentially provide additional\
    \ information and/or increased sampling accu-\nracy. However, due to the lack\
    \ of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolu-\ntion, these advantages\
    \ mostly are not yet used in practical farming. This paper summa-\nrizes where\
    \ hyperspectral data provide additional value and information in an agricultural\
    \ \ncontext. It lists the variables of interest and highlights the contribution\
    \ of hyperspectral \nsensing for information-driven agriculture, preparing the\
    \ application of future operational \nspaceborne hyperspectral missions.\nKeywords\

    \ Food System\nIn pre-industrial times, producers and consumers in the food system\
    \ were identical. Before \nthe late eighteenth and middle of the nineteenth century,\
    \ the majority of the European \ncountry’s population settled in rural areas and\
    \ was occupied with agricultural activities \n(Goodwin et  al. 2008). Consumption\
    \ and production of food happened parallel to each \nother. Nowadays, global large-scale\
    \ processes like urbanization, which has exponentially \nincreased in the last\
    \ three decades (Chen et al. 2014), have led to a more complex and spa-\ntially\
    \ divided manifestation of the commodity flows. The global food system, whose\
    \ most \nprominent flows are sketched in generalized form in Fig. 1, is supposed\
    \ to be in a more \nor less balanced state between the demand by consumers, who\
    \ increasingly live in cities, \nand the supply by the producers, who farm the\
    \ land in a predominantly rural environment. \nSites of food production and consumption\
    \ have become spatially dislocated (Gunasekera \nand Finnigan 2010) and are now\
    \ connected via a globally operating food industry, which \nworks within food\
    \ security frameworks that have been established by regional governance \nsystems\
    \ (Danbom 1995). The food industry on one side processes agricultural goods and\
    \ \nprovides food according to the consumer’s needs, values and preferences, while\
    \ it steers the \nflow of money back to the farmers on the other hand, thus maintaining\
    \ farm economy.\nProfitability is the key of global food production, driving technological\
    \ and infra-\nstructural investments. In economic terms, agricultural land use,\
    \ intensification and land \nexpansion take place, under given regulations, where\
    \ it is profitable to do so (Byerlee et al. \n2014). Market forces increase with\
    \ the number of farmers connected to the global agri-\ncultural markets. Thus,\
    \ economic and regulatory factors, paired with the underlying con-\ntinued processes\
    \ of globalization and global environmental change, determine how much \nfood\
    \ will be produced. Farmers work the land and produce agricultural products with\
    \ \nthe use of capital, water, energy and technology. The environment, characterized\
    \ by soil \nFig. 1  Generalization of the most important flows in the Global Food\
    \ System [modified after www.shift \nn.com; figure originally developed for the\
    \ UK Government Office for Science (GOS 2011)]. It can be \nobserved that one\
    \ of the important flows is information, which is partly derived from satellite\
    \ observations\n517\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\nfertility,\
    \ temperature conditions and available water resources, is their main production\
    \ fac-\ntor. Farmers thereby increasingly use science and technology (machinery,\
    \ fertilizers and \nplant protection agents, seeds and information, e.g., from\
    \ remote sensing) to optimize the \nuse of the naturally available production\
    \ factors and to improve economic benefit (Wal-\nter et al. 2017). Environmental\
    \ production factors, on the other hand, are subject to cli-\nmate change and\
    \ environmental degradation within unsustainable farming systems (FAO \n2016).\
    \ At the same time, a growing and increasingly wealthy global population relies\
    \ on \nthe global food system to satisfy daily food, fibre and energy demands.\
    \ The global meg-\natrends (climate change, population change, technological change,\
    \ etc.) gradually cause the \nsupply–demand-balance to shift. The suppliers, i.e.\
    \ the farmers, are continuously striving \nto reinstall the equilibrium by adapting\
    \ and optimizing agricultural production methods. \nGiven the current demographic\
    \ development, farmers are forced to increase the yields \nachieved by cultivating\
    \ a certain acreage of bioproductive land surface, while at the same \ntime protecting\
    \ their most important production factor, i.e. the environment, from degra-\n\
    dation and from emissions (FAO 2016). The threat emanating from emissions thereby\
    \ is \nbased on two different pathways. The leaching of  NO3, which has not been\
    \ taken up by \nthe crop during growth, pollutes groundwater and thus has a direct\
    \ effect on human health \n(Ritter et al. 2002). At the same time, gaseous emissions\
    \ of  NOX enter the atmosphere and \nlead to the formation of tropospheric ozone,\
    \ a greenhouse gas pushing climate change, but \nalso potentially harming crops\
    \ directly (Robertson et al. 2013). In addition, emissions from \nexcessive use\
    \ of plant protection agents contribute to environmental pollution (Ritter et al.\
    \ \n2002). One recent trend to mitigate these problems in agricultural production\
    \ is the appli-\ncation of organic farming methods, which do not rely on the application\
    \ of mineral ferti-\nlizers and plant protection agents (Shams et al. 2017). However,\
    \ organic farming still is a \ntrade-off between increased environmental protection\
    \ and reduced overall yields and yield \nsecurity. Besides organic production,\
    \ site-specific precision farming is another farming \nperspective (Blackmore\
    \ 1994). Thereby, all means of production are spatially optimized to \nprevent\
    \ unnecessary expenses and unwanted emission at the same time. Precision farming\
    \ \nis an important component of smart farming, which aims at an information-driven\
    \ optimi-\nzation of all aspects of a farming system (Bach et al. 2016). Some\
    \ of the most important \napplications of smart farming are:\n• Using computer-aided\
    \ information technology, such as Farm Management Informa-\ntion Systems (FMIS),\
    \ for administration and documentation of work helps the farmer to \nkeep track\
    \ of expenses on and revenues from individual fields (Zhang et al. 2002).\n• Using\
    \ satellite-guided precision navigation prevents overlap between driving lanes\
    \ and \nhelps optimizing the distribution of different machines on the farm thus\
    \ saving fuel and \nperson-hours (Zhang et al. 2002).\n• Using long-term Earth\
    \ Observation helps to identify different soil qualities on a farm \nand thus\
    \ helps to optimize soil sampling (Plant et al. 2000).\n• Using long-term Earth\
    \ Observation also helps to identify persistent growth patterns, \nwhich indicate\
    \ the variability of different growth conditions on a farm (e.g., www.\ntalki\
    \ ngfie lds.de/en/base-map/). This information can be used for the planning of\
    \ long-\nterm soil enrichment measures, such as increasing soil organic matter\
    \ content through \nploughing green manure. It also can be applied for site-specific\
    \ planning of seeding \ndensity.\n• Using real-time Earth Observation, either\
    \ from satellites, planes, drones or vehicles, \ncan contribute to site-specific\
    \ planning of four very important management measures \n(Mulla 2013), as there\
    \ are (1) fertilization (e.g., Cidad et al. 2001), (2) plant protection \n 518\n\
    Surveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\n(e.g., Herwitz et al. 2004), (3)\
    \ irrigation (e.g., Calera et al. 2017), and (4) harvesting \n(e.g., Yang et al.\
    \ 2013). Thereby, so-called map-overlay approaches combining differ-\nent data\
    \ sources, e.g., satellite sensors and ground-based sensors, seem to represent\
    \ the \nmost promising method (Auernhammer et al. 1999).\nPrecision farming thus\
    \ holds potential for increasing yields on limited land while at the \nsame time-saving\
    \ resources and preventing environmental pollution (Plant et  al. 2000). \nCurrent\
    \ studies show that increased yield levels not necessarily need to be connected\
    \ to \nenvironmental degradation (see review Balafoutis et al. 2017). The so-called\
    \ green water \nproductivity (kg grain produced per kg water used) has been observed\
    \ for wheat, rice and \nmaize crops to more or less linearly increase with rising\
    \ yield levels until an average yield \nlevel of 8 tons per hectare is reached\
    \ (Rockström et al. 2007). Above this point, no fur-\nther increase in the green\
    \ water productivity can be observed. Sustainability thus becomes \na matter of\
    \ balancing yield levels in a dimension around this average, because obviously\
    \ \nlow yield levels, which do not make efficient use of the environmental production\
    \ factors, \nare just as unsustainable as too high yields, which drain the natural\
    \ resources and lead to \ndegradation.\nOne very important aspect of precision\
    \ farming is that the method not only is associated \nwith ecologic advantages\
    \ but also economic profitability can be increased through site-\nspecific farming\
    \ (Balafoutis et al. 2017), which makes an actual large-scale implementation \n\
    of precision farming likely. However, the most efficient use of the land surface\
    \ and thus \nthe most economic and ecologic profit, can only be achieved by farmers\
    \ who have access \nto all information concerning the individual needs of their\
    \ worked land. While in some \nparts of the world smallholder farming is still\
    \ the dominant form of agricultural production \n(Lowder et al. 2016), in developed\
    \ countries the use of digital information for the highly \nefficient cultivation\
    \ of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in recent years \n(Walter\
    \ et al. 2017). Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management\
    \ \nis a major trend at least in some developed countries. For instance, in the\
    \ USA, the market \narea share of satellite data has tripled during the last 10 years,\
    \ as can be observed in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2  Development of market area using precision\
    \ services over time as estimated by dealers of farm \nequipment in the USA (2018\
    \ predicted), showing the strong increase in use of satellite-based information\
    \ \ntechnology in agricultural practice; based on data by Erickson and Widmar\
    \ (2015)\n519\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\nAlthough the most\
    \ prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation via \n\
    GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, e.g., for GPS-based soil sampling,\
    \ see Fig. 2), \nalso Earth Observation (EO) has been increasingly applied (Satellite\
    \ imagery, Fig. 2). The \nhighest share, however, is allotted to custom applications,\
    \ which are individually tailored to \nthe information needs of the farmer and\
    \ which, according to Erickson and Widmar (2015), \nin many cases also are based\
    \ on satellite-derived data (e.g., field mapping with GPS) but \nalso on statistical\
    \ data (e.g., yield monitor analysis). Some operational services have been \n\
    recently established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information,\
    \ \ne.g., talkingfields (VISTA, Germany; Bach and Angermair 2017; Bach and Mauser\
    \ 2018) \nor Irrisat (Ariespace, Italy; Ariespace 2017) etc. The development of\
    \ these services has \nmostly been boosted by the increased availability of (cost-free)\
    \ multispectral imagery from \nNASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus\
    \ programs, respectively. Using mul-\ntispectral data has arrived in the agricultural\
    \ commodity chain. This development comes \nalong with new challenges such as\
    \ handling big data. Currently, the large amount of data is \nmostly due to high\
    \ revisit rates at reasonably high spatial resolution (e.g., Sentinel-2). The\
    \ \nbig data load so far is not so much due to a detailed spectral sampling of\
    \ the Earth’s sur-\nface, although spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling,\
    \ often referred to as hyperspec-\ntral remote sensing (HRS) or imaging spectroscopy\
    \ (IS; Goetz et al. 1985), can potentially \nprovide additional information and/or\
    \ increased sampling accuracy compared to multispec-\ntral data. Since a few years,\
    \ HRS-IS technologies have been well accepted by the remote \nsensing community\
    \ as an innovative tool for various research applications, not only in agri-\n\
    culture but also in atmospheric sciences, geology, ecology, soil science, limnology,\
    \ pedol-\nogy and other areas. However, due to the lack of large-scale hyperspectral\
    \ EO systems, \nthese advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming.\
    \ With some new spaceborne \nhyperspectral missions being currently developed,\
    \ e.g., the Italian PRISMA (Labate et al. \n2009), US HyspIRI (Roberts et al.\
    \ 2012), or the German EnMAP (Guanter et al. 2015), the \navailability of hyperspectral\
    \ data and its use and application in practical farming will soon \nbe demonstrated\
    \ and scientifically justified with on-farm research.\nThis paper summarizes where\
    \ hyperspectral data can provide additional value and \ninformation in an agricultural\
    \ context. It lists the variables of interest, reviews the retrieval \nmethods\
    \ and highlights the additional value of hyperspectral sensing for agricultural\
    \ appli-\ncations, thus preparing the application of operational spaceborne hyperspectral\
    \ missions in \nmodern agriculture.\n2  Earth Observation Opportunities to Support\
    \ Food Production \nEfficiency\n“Remote sensing data can greatly contribute to\
    \ the monitoring task by providing timely, \nsynoptic, cost-efficient and repetitive\
    \ information about the status of the Earth’s surface” \n[Justice et al. (2002)\
    \ in Atzberger (2013)]. The basis for retrieving information in a spatial \nway\
    \ from multispectral data is the assumption of a relation between structural and\
    \ bio-\nchemical traits that describe the state of the canopy and the spectral\
    \ reflectance that results \nfrom the specific variable composition (Mauser et al.\
    \ 2012). From an agricultural point of \nview, soil and vegetation properties\
    \ are of special interest. Observing soils with hyperspec-\ntral observation systems\
    \ for instance allows retrieving information on soil organic carbon \nand soil\
    \ iron-oxide content (Stevens et al. 2010), which both can be important indicators\
    \ for \nsoil fertility. However, the impact of soil analysis through remote sensing\
    \ for agricultural \n 520\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\npractice\
    \ is strongly limited due to three reasons: (1) Retrieval of soil organic carbon\
    \ con-\ntent is highly influenced by the current moisture state of the soil, because\
    \ different moisture \nstates strongly influence soil brightness. Soil moisture,\
    \ however, is very variable in space \nand time so that difficulties arise when\
    \ acquisitions should be compared to in situ measure-\nments (Stevens et al. 2010).\
    \ (2) Optical sensors operating in the visible (VIS), near-infrared \n(NIR) and\
    \ shortwave-infrared (SWIR) are not capable of penetrating the canopy, so soil\
    \ \nobservations are only feasible for surfaces with very low vegetation coverage\
    \ (Haubrock \net al. 2008). This excludes analysing permanent crops and strongly\
    \ limits continuous soil \nmonitoring during the growth cycle. (3) Sensors in\
    \ the VIS, NIR and SWIR domain also \nare not capable of penetrating the soil\
    \ surface. The information that might be extracted \nfrom optical remote measurements\
    \ of the soil is restricted to the uppermost soil surface \n(Haubrock et al. 2008).\
    \ The true production potential of soils nonetheless lies in the deeper \nsoil\
    \ horizons that are accessed by the roots of the canopy and which provide water\
    \ and \nnutrients to the crop. However, this hidden information on soil column\
    \ properties becomes \nsecondarily accessible when the plant itself is used as\
    \ sensor, because the vigour of plants \nsensitively reacts to soil-related environmental\
    \ conditions, e.g., to drought and nutrient \nstress (Basu et al. 2016). In order\
    \ to make use of the plant response, the relation between \ncrop biochemical and\
    \ structural traits and the reflectance must precisely be known. It is \na commonly\
    \ promoted limitation of vegetation remote sensing that the spectral signal of\
    \ \nactively growing vegetation looks pretty similar across a wide range of different\
    \ plant types \nand cultivars (e.g., Nidamanuri and Zbell 2011; Wilson et al.\
    \ 2014; Zomer et al. 2009). \nThis similarity in the opinion of the authors should\
    \ not be perceived as drawback, but \nshould rather be interpreted as proof that\
    \ the underlying physical and chemical processes \nthat contribute to vegetation\
    \ growth on the Earth’s surface (light collection, gas exchange, \nphenological\
    \ cycles, carbon assimilation and allocation) more or less apply uniformly for\
    \ \nall vegetation types. Due to these uniformly and globally applicable mechanisms,\
    \ the states \nof those vegetation variables that leave traces in the spectral\
    \ reflectance of the canopy can \npotentially be observed by remote sensing and,\
    \ consequently, can be analysed through non-\ncrop-specific approaches. Figure 3\
    \ gives an overview of spectral domains, which respond \nto changes in specific\
    \ vegetation variables, regardless of vegetation type and cultivar.\nFigure  3\
    \ supports two important findings: (1) Information contained in a vegetation \n\
    spectrum is rich and diverse. It reaches from biochemical information (pigments\
    \ and water \ncontent) over process information (light use efficiency, LUE) to\
    \ structural information (leaf \narea index, LAI, leaf inclination, etc.). (2)\
    \ The partial disagreement between the hyperspec-\ntral and the multispectral\
    \ reflectance spectrum indicates the limited information content of \nmultispectral\
    \ sensors for diverse vegetation properties and processes. Very advanced mul-\n\
    tispectral EO systems, such as ESA’s Sentinel-2, already allow deriving valuable\
    \ informa-\ntion of vegetation properties, e.g., shown by Clevers et al. (2017),\
    \ Frampton et al. (2013), \nHerrmann et al. (2011), Vuolo et al. (2016). Nevertheless,\
    \ hyperspectral sensors, dealing \nwith narrow spectral bands over a continuous\
    \ spectral range, will be able to detect prop-\nerties more accurately, especially\
    \ in the VIS and SWIR domain. Characteristic shapes of \nindividual absorption\
    \ features caused by diverse biochemical or biophysical plant compo-\nnents may\
    \ be located spectrally very close to each other. In contrast to hyperspectral\
    \ data, \nbroadband scanners are not able to resolve the specific wavelength position\
    \ of these fea-\ntures, which relate for instance to several pigments (anthocyanins,\
    \ carotenoids) or proteins \n[see studies from Kokaly et al. (2007), Kokaly and\
    \ Skidmore (2015), Sahoo et al. (2015), \nThenkabail et al. (2000)].\nPotentially,\
    \ all information contained in the spectrum is of interest to farmers. The \n\
    value of specific variables, i.e. biophysical or biochemical products, for practical\
    \ precision \n521\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\nfarming depends\
    \ on the scientist’s capabilities of retrieving a variable with adequate preci-\n\
    sion. In order to unlock the information contained in the hyperspectral readings\
    \ as biophys-\nical and biochemical products for precision farming purposes, several\
    \ steps are required. \nThis includes the choice of a suitable and capable retrieval\
    \ method that also accounts for \nmeasurement errors of the radiometric data (sensor\
    \ noise) and field validation data (sam-\npling errors, natural heterogeneity;\
    \ Baret and Buis 2008). The retrieval process further \ndeals with complex reflectance\
    \ anisotropies (Walthall 1997), discriminates the signal \nof overlapping absorption\
    \ features and finally yet importantly follows the direct relation \nbetween cause\
    \ and effect. For this purpose, physical laws were established inferring bio-\n\
    physical and biochemical variables based on specific knowledge, typically obtained\
    \ with \nradiative transfer functions (Verrelst et al. 2015).\nThe abundance of\
    \ information that can potentially be derived from vegetation spec-\ntra has to\
    \ be carefully selected for applications in agricultural practice. In short, remotely\
    \ \nmeasured information that is of direct relevance for practical farming should\
    \ meet four \ncriteria:\n1. The derived information must be biophysical/biochemical\
    \ in the sense that it can be \ndescribed in physical units: “In particular, the\
    \ broader availability of air- and space-\nborne directional imaging spectrometer\
    \ data supports the estimation of biophysical and \nbiochemical variables with\
    \ unprecedented accuracy and in calibrated physical units…” \n(Schaepman et al.\
    \ 2005). Relative measures, as they are, e.g., derived via vegetation \nFig. 3\

    \ help in agricultural practice, because comparability and trans-\nferability\
    \ are limited (Baret and Buis 2008).\n2. The derived information must be directly\
    \ observable in the spectrum. This means that \na direct relation between state\
    \ variable and the reflectance in a specific spectral domain \nexists, which can\
    \ be analysed using different retrieval methods (for a review, see Verrelst \n\
    et al. 2015).\n3. The derived information must be retrievable at a generalized\
    \ level independent from \nspecific cultivars, because cultivars in most cases\
    \ are not known to the analysers and thus \ncannot be taken into account during\
    \ the retrieval. Generalization capabilities of inver-\nsion/retrieval methods\
    \ are discussed by Durbha et al. (2007) and Kimes et al. (2000).\n4. The derived\
    \ information must be of importance for practical farming (Moran et al. \n1997).\n\
    The following section aims to identify the biophysical and biochemical variables\
    \ that are \nrelevant for practical farming according to the criteria mentioned\
    \ above. The variables are \ndescribed and their importance for practical precision\
    \ farming is elaborated. Section 3.1 \ndescribes the biochemical leaf (canopy)\
    \ variables, Sect. 3.2 the canopy biophysical vari-\nables and Sect. 3.3 is dedicated\
    \ to the two variables soil and land use.\n3  Overview of Biophysical and Biochemical\
    \ Variables with Direct \nRelevance for Practical Farming\nProviding an overview\
    \ of the diversity of agriculturally relevant information addressed in \nthe context\
    \ of this review paper, Table 1 lists the different variables together with their\
    \ most \ncommonly used physical units, highlights the variable’s respective use\
    \ in practical farming \nand compares field and remote sampling techniques with\
    \ special emphasis on the benefits \nexpected from imaging spectroscopy. Note\
    \ that the variables and retrieval techniques listed \nin Table 1 primarily apply\
    \ to homogeneous crop farming. With this, we refer to uniformly \ncultivated fields\
    \ at least in the size of several pixels captured by imaging spectrometers. For\
    \ \nsmallholder farming and geometrically complex crops, other scanning techniques,\
    \ such as \nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or low-altitude manned aircrafts, are\
    \ more appropriate \nand different types of variables can be derived from such\
    \ high spatial resolution imagery.\n3.1  Leaf and Canopy Biochemical Variables\n\
    3.1.1  Leaf/Canopy Chlorophyll Content\nLeaf chlorophyll content (LCC) usually\
    \ is measured in units of µg chlorophyll per  cm2 \nleaf area, whereas canopy\
    \ chlorophyll content (CCC) is measured in g chlorophyll per  m2 \nground area.\
    \ Both variables indicate the presence of chlorophyll pigments in vegetation.\
    \ \nSince chlorophyll is the pigment responsible for the absorption of energy,\
    \ the abundance \nof chlorophyll indicates the potential of a plant cell to provide\
    \ energy for photosynthetic \nprocesses and thus forms the basis for vegetation\
    \ growth on the Earth’s surface (Peng et al. \n2017). Leaf chlorophyll content\
    \ and canopy chlorophyll content are one of the most impor-\ntant variables for\
    \ farming. Because chlorophyll molecules are constructed with the help of \nfour\
    \ nitrogen atoms in the chlorine-magnesium ligand, a direct relation between the\
    \ nitro-\ngen supply and the accumulation of chlorophyll exists. CCC was therefore\

    \ 2007; Clevers and Gitelson 2013) and \ncrop primary production (e.g., Gitelson\
    \ et al. 2006; Peng et al. 2011). Increasing levels of \nchlorophyll in the crop\
    \ indicate the amount of nitrogen that has successfully entered the \ncanopy and\
    \ thus has contributed to the construction of proteins and light-harvesting pig-\n\
    ments. This balance is summarized under the term nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).\
    \ Rapidly \ngenerating high levels of chlorophyll content thus has ecological\
    \ and economic advantages. \nOn the other hand, over-fertilization can result\
    \ in unhealthy accumulation of chlorophyll \nin the leaves, i.e. necrosis, or\
    \ in weakened structural stability, i.e. lodging, which again \ninhibits growth.\
    \ Hyperspectral sensors, due to their continuous sampling of the VIS and \nred\
    \ edge spectral domain, are ideally suited to measure leaf chlorophyll content\
    \ (Gitel-\nson et al. 2003), which is the reason why spectrometers are the tool\
    \ predominantly used \nfor chlorophyll measurements in laboratory analysis, where\
    \ the easily soluble chlorophyll \ncan be extracted from the plant tissue using\
    \ organic solvents (Parry et al. 2014). Satellites, \nhowever, observe the canopy\
    \ as a whole from above. This synoptic view of the canopy is \naccompanied by\
    \ ambiguity problems, since for specific spectral domains interaction effects\
    \ \namong multiple vegetation traits on measured reflectance exist (Combal et \
    \ al. 2003). \nFrom a practical farming point of view, the leaf chlorophyll content\
    \ is the most important \ninformation for planning fertilization measures during\
    \ the vegetative phase (Arregui et al. \n2006). The challenge remains to discern\
    \ between structural and chemical traits of the can-\nopy (e.g., Daughtry et al.\
    \ 2000; Haboudane et al. 2002). This can only be achieved through \nhierarchical\
    \ retrieval methods, which take the continuous spectrum into account and where\
    \ \nstructural canopy properties are determined first and chemical properties\
    \ are delineated \nthrough secondary retrieval iterations, (e.g., Danner et al.\
    \ 2017).\n3.1.2  Total Leaf Carotenoid Content\nThe total carotenoid content of\
    \ leaves (Car) is mainly composed of the xanthophyll cycle \npigments and carotenes.\
    \ They play an important role in photoprotection, accessory light \nharvesting\
    \ and energy transfer (Gitelson et al. 2002; Kong et al. 2017). Carotenoids are\
    \ \npresent in variable proportions during the differentiation and ageing of leaves,\
    \ but abi-\notic stress can inhibit carotenoid production. This includes, for\
    \ instance, ozone or sulphur \ndioxide air pollution (Agrawal et al. 1982), heavy\
    \ metals (Panda et al. 2003), viral attacks \n(Ibdah et  al. 2014) or water deficiency\
    \ (Mibei et  al. 2017). Therefore, carotenoids may \nserve as indicators for down-regulation\
    \ of photosynthesis due to environmental stressors.\nA review study by Blackburn\
    \ (2007) confirmed the growing value of hyperspectral \nremote sensing for plant\
    \ pigment estimations in ecophysiology, environmental, agricultural \nand forestry\
    \ sciences. Extraction of biochemical properties has been accomplished from \n\
    hyperspectral data using various methods. Thereby the presence of carotenoids\
    \ is com-\nmonly expressed in different units, e.g., as mass per unit surface\
    \ area (g m−2), as mass \nper unit leaf area (g cm−2), or as mass per unit fresh\
    \ leaf weight (mg g−1) e.g., by Yi et al. \n(2014).\nCompared to leaf chlorophyll,\
    \ there are much fewer studies estimating leaf carotenoid \ncontent (Yi et al.\
    \ 2014) and even less dealing with agricultural crops. Generally, the benefit\
    \ \nof hyperspectral data for separating the subtle signals of the different pigments\
    \ was recog-\nnized by several studies (Blackburn 1998; Chappelle et al. 1992;\
    \ Feret et al. 2008).\n527\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\n3.1.3\
    \  Total Leaf Anthocyanin Content\nAnthocyanins are the most common class of flavonoids.\
    \ They are responsible for the \norange to red, or purple to blue coloration in\
    \ the tissue depending on the molecule, tem-\nperature and pH value, as it can\
    \ be found, for instance, in blueberry, raspberry, black rice \nor black soybean\
    \ (Tanaka et al. 2008). From all the red pigments, including carotenoids \nand\
    \ betalains, anthocyanins are the most widespread. Though the full role of anthocyanins\
    \ \nstill is not completely understood, some essential functions of these pigments\
    \ have been \nidentified, such as protection against photoinhibition from intense\
    \ light and mitigation of \nenvironmental stresses such as freezing or air pollution.\
    \ In crops, anthocyanins typically \nare present when the plants are suffering\
    \ from drought, freezing or nutrient deficiency (Lee \nand Gould 2002; Springob\
    \ et al. 2003).\nLeaf anthocyanin content was introduced in the latest version\
    \ of the leaf optical proper-\nties model PROSPECT-D (Féret et al. 2017). The\
    \ model simulates directional–hemispheri-\ncal reflectance and transmittance for\
    \ the spectral range from 400 to 2500 nm and, besides \nthe anthocyanin content,\
    \ requires leaf chlorophyll content, a leaf structure parameter, carot-\nenoid\
    \ content, brown pigments, equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per unit area\
    \ as \ninputs. Variables can be retrieved from measured leaf spectra by model\
    \ inversion or from \ncanopy spectra by coupling PROSPECT-D with a radiative transfer\
    \ model, such as 4SAIL \n(Jacquemoud et al. 2009; Verhoef and Bach 2003). The\
    \ use of the model for anthocya-\nnin retrieval is limited to hyperspectral data\
    \ with high spectral resolution in the VIS spec-\ntral domain. The use of narrow-band\
    \ vegetation indices allows quite accurate retrieval of \nanthocyanin content\
    \ against the background of very variable chlorophyll content (Gitelson \nand\
    \ Solovchenko 2017; Gitelson et al. 2001, 2009).\n3.1.4  Leaf Protein Content/Nitrogen\
    \ Content\nWith rubisco accounting for 30–50% of nitrogen (N) in green leaves,\
    \ proteins are the prin-\ncipal N-containing biochemical constituent of plants\
    \ (Kokaly et  al. 2009). Nitrogen, on \nthe other hand, is probably the most important\
    \ nutrient that plants acquire from the soil. \nA proper management of nitrogen\
    \ is a prerequisite for sustainable fertilization in modern \nagriculture: optimal\
    \ crop yield from, e.g., high-quality grains, can only be obtained with \nhigh\
    \ uptakes of N (Barraclough et al. 2010). Nitrogen deficiency leads to decreased\
    \ photo-\nsynthetic assimilation and to reduced crop yield in terms of quantity\
    \ and quality (Jay et al. \n2017). Hyperspectral data have been recognized as\
    \ a promising tool for the non-destructive \ndetection of crop nitrogen for several\
    \ reasons: the wavelengths important for nitrogen esti-\nmation have been found\
    \ over the whole spectrum due to correlation between nitrogen and \nother variables\
    \ (Curran 1989; Homolová et al. 2013). The absorption features of nitrogen-\n\
    containing biochemical leaf components, such as LCC (6.5% by weight) and proteins\
    \ may \nserve as proxies for crop N. The chlorophyll absorption features in the\
    \ VIS and red edge \ncan be used for nitrogen estimation due to a close relationship\
    \ of LCC to N during early \ngrowth stages (le Maire et al. 2008). During senescence,\
    \ however, the decomposition of \nlight-harvesting pigments and the translocation\
    \ of N from leaves, stems and roots lead to \ngradual changes in the spectral\
    \ signal of VIS and NIR without being connected to signifi-\ncant changes of total\
    \ N in the plant. Moving away from the leaf level perspective towards \nthe integration\
    \ of the full canopy within a specified surface, area acted as a normaliza-\n\
    tion factor, improving the N versus Chl relationship. A very strong linear relationship\
    \ was \nestablished across growing seasons between maize N and Chl contents at\
    \ the canopy level \n 528\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\n(Schlemmer\
    \ et  al. 2013). While monitoring crop nitrogen uptake during the early veg-\n\
    etative growth phases is of major importance for the planning of fertilization\
    \ measures, \nnitrogen monitoring during senescent growth stages provides valuable\
    \ information on \nyield quality. Continuous information of crop nitrogen during\
    \ the different growth stages \nwould consequently be of high economic impact.\
    \ Absorption features of proteins can be \nfound in the SWIR. Recently, protein\
    \ absorption coefficients also have been integrated into \nleaf reflectance models\
    \ and first applications for woody and herbaceous species have been \nexplored\
    \ (Wang et al. 2015). However, protein absorptions are very shallow and are largely\
    \ \nobscured by water absorption features, so that measuring protein content from\
    \ crop cano-\npies with spectroscopy remains a challenge.\n3.1.5  Leaf Mass Area\n\
    Leaf Mass Area (LMA) denotes the relation of leaf mass to leaf area in a unit\
    \ of kg dry \nmatter per  m2 leaf area. In some publications also its reverse\
    \ is used, i.e. specific leaf area \n(SLA, leaf area per unit dry mass; e.g.,\
    \ Ali et al. 2017). This fundamental leaf functional \ntrait plays a key role\
    \ in ecosystem modelling (Ali et al. 2017; Asner et al. 2011). LMA is \na measure\
    \ of the leaf composition: the first leaves developed by a plant at the beginning\
    \ of \nits individual growth cycle usually are rather lightweight, so that the\
    \ area available for the \ninterception of solar radiation expands rapidly during\
    \ early growth phases. During later \ndevelopment stages, plants tend to invest\
    \ more biomass into the structural stability of the \nleaves, causing the LMA\
    \ to increase over the course of a growing period and, depending \non the crop\
    \ type, also with increasing LAI of the canopy. However, this process is highly\
    \ \ncrop-specific and can only be observed through labour-intensive destructive\
    \ measurements, \nso that only few data on this variable exist.\nLMA is an essential\
    \ indicator of plant functioning, including photosynthetic and res-\npiratory\
    \ rates, chemical composition or resistance to herbivory (de la Riva et al. 2016).\
    \ The \nimportance of LMA for farming compared to the other variables is therefore\
    \ rather indirect \nbut nonetheless important, in particular regarding the relationship\
    \ of LMA to photosynthe-\nsis–nitrogen relationships (Poorter and Evans 1998).\n\
    The spectral recognition of LMA is difficult, because the effect caused by increasing\
    \ \nLMA in the leaf reflectance spectrum results in a gradual decrease in reflectance\
    \ in the \nNIR shoulder region. A similar effect is achieved by the variations\
    \ of other structural can-\nopy variables, such as LAI and ALA, and is influenced\
    \ by illumination/viewing angles. \nConsequently, a study by Asner et al. (2011)\
    \ demonstrated that the best-suited wavelengths \nfor accurate LMA determination\
    \ are found in sections of the spectrum, where the over-\nlap effects with other\
    \ variables are less pronounced, i.e. in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) \nbetween\
    \ 1900 and 2500 nm and from 1300 to 1700 nm, as well as in the visible region\
    \ \nfrom 400 to 800 nm. A derivation of LMA from spectral measurements thus is\
    \ only pos-\nsible if (1) the full spectrum is taken into account, and (2) all\
    \ potentially confounding vari-\nables are retrieved simultaneously. This can\
    \ best be achieved through inversion of canopy \nreflectance models exploiting\
    \ the full spectral data cube, such as PROSAIL (Jacquemoud \net al. 2009) or SLC\
    \ (Migdall et al. 2009; Verhoef and Bach 2007).\n3.1.6  Equivalent Water Thickness/Canopy\
    \ Water Content\nThe variable Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) or leaf water content\
    \ describes the \nthickness of a theoretical layer of water (in cm), which absorbs\
    \ radiation according to \n529\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\n\
    the Lambert–Beer law (Nobel 2009). Thus, EWT corresponds to the volume of water\
    \ \nthat is stored within the cells of living vegetation.\nA well-known problem\
    \ is the decoupling of the spectral signal of the three different \naggregate\
    \ states of water, which is necessary for a correct retrieval of EWT. A study\
    \ \nshowed that the use of hyperspectral data can strongly support the simultaneous\
    \ esti-\nmation of the abundance of gaseous, liquid and frozen water for a defined\
    \ environment \n(Green et  al. 2006). The authors obtained uncertainties < 1.5%\
    \ for all three phases, \nbut there were still problems in retrieving the liquid\
    \ water in vegetation, making more \nresearch in this domain necessary.\nFor a\
    \ remote sensor with a defined field of view, it is difficult to decouple the\
    \ con-\ntributions of leaf water content and LAI. Thus, the total canopy water\
    \ content per unit \nground area (CWC, g m−2), rather than leaf EWT is usually\
    \ “observed” or retrieved \n(Clevers et al. 2010). CWC is a measure for the moisture\
    \ state of a canopy, which is of \ninterest for practical farming in two aspects:\n\
    First, CWC is a variable that describes the maturity state of a crop. Depending\
    \ on \nthe crop type, crops are harvested at specific thresholds of residual moisture\
    \ (e.g., \nPeters 2012). This guarantees optimal storage stability and documents\
    \ the yield quality \nin the sense of the true net weight of the harvest. Assessing\
    \ the residual moisture in a \nspatially explicit way through remote sensing enables\
    \ farmers to develop harvesting \nstrategies, e.g., which field or which part\
    \ of a field to harvest first, and to document \nthe quality of the harvest. Actually,\
    \ modern harvesting systems already are measur-\ning residual moisture during\
    \ the harvesting process with infrared sensors installed in \ncombine harvesters\
    \ (Peters 2012). However, the proximity of the measurement leads \nto failures,\
    \ such as clogging of the grain elevators, and the sampling occurs more or \n\
    less at random and not in a spatially comprehensive way, so that these measurements\
    \ \nstill are of limited use. Deriving spatial maps, which describe the temporal\
    \ dynamics \nof residual moisture based on satellite data, thus would be of high\
    \ interest for practical \nfarming.\nSecondly, CWC can be used to monitor irrigation,\
    \ which causes significant environ-\nmental changes in many parts of the world.\
    \ Precise information on the extent of irriga-\ntion measures is fundamental for\
    \ global change research, where, e.g., water exchange \nbetween the land surface\
    \ and the atmosphere is explicitly modelled to assess impacts \non global food\
    \ security (Ozdogan et al. 2010). In arid environments, irrigation can be \neasily\
    \ detected, because vegetation only prevails in irrigated areas. In humid environ-\n\
    ments, such as the temperate zone or even within the boundaries of irrigated fields,\
    \ \nhowever, detecting irrigation becomes more difficult (Ozdogan et al. 2010).\
    \ Only few \nstudies have approached the problem of irrigated area mapping in\
    \ humid areas (e.g., \nThenkabail et al. 2005). Although CWC and EWT are directly\
    \ connected to the water \nsupply state of crops and the use of CWC or EWT to\
    \ monitor drought seems rational, \nthe variable may not be directly suited as\
    \ early drought indicator. This is due to the \nfact that one of the earliest\
    \ reactions of plants to water deficit is the maintenance of \nEWT through stomatal\
    \ control (Yang and Ling 2004). A decline in EWT, as it can be \ndetected with\
    \ hyperspectral sensors, thus can be used to document the dehydration of \nthe\
    \ tissue, but the signal would be detected at a too late point in time to initiate\
    \ coun-\nter management measures. Thermal imaging systems are far better suited\
    \ to indicate \nearly signs of drought based on the leaf energy balance (Prashar\
    \ and Jones 2016). For \ninstance, the crop water stress index (CWSI) proved to\
    \ detect drought stress earlier \nthan EWT estimates (Yang and Ling 2004).\n 530\n\
    Surveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\n3.1.7  Non‑photosynthetically Active\
    \ Vegetation (Lignin + Cellulose)\nNon-photosynthetically active vegetation (NPV)\
    \ elements refer to vegetation com-\npounds that cannot perform photosynthesis,\
    \ such as plant litter, crop residues, senescing \nfoliage, branches and stems\
    \ (Zhaoqin and Xulin 2015). NPV is mainly composed of \nlignin, cellulose and\
    \ starch, being the most abundant molecules produced by terrestrial \nphotosynthesis.\
    \ Therefore, the importance of estimating NPV, or vegetation brownness, \nfor\
    \ understanding terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and changes is evident (Dennison\
    \ \net al. 2016; Okin 2010). For agricultural applications, NPV is particularly\
    \ interesting \nin three aspects: (1) Variations in NPV—or the ratio of vital\
    \ to senescent foliage—can \nindicate (seasonal) drought events. (2) Non-photosynthetic\
    \ crop residues on the soil \nsurface significantly reduce soil erosion and enhance\
    \ soil organic C through improve-\nment of the soil structure. (3) Non-photosynthetic\
    \ crop residues may contain significant \namounts of nitrogen, which enter the\
    \ soil through ploughing and which must be taken \ninto account when balancing\
    \ the nitrogen inputs during the following season.\nEffective crop residue management\
    \ systems therefore require rapid site-specific \nquantification of crop residues\
    \ over large areas, which can only be obtained with the \nhelp of remote sensing\
    \ technologies (Daughtry et al. 2005). Several studies developed \nhyperspectral\
    \ indices for NPV estimation, which are based on the absorption features of \n\
    cellulose and lignin in the SWIR. For a review of the topic, e.g., see Zhaoqin\
    \ and Xulin \n(2015). Comparable to the nitrogen absorption features, the cellulose\
    \ and lignin absorp-\ntions overlap with other variables, e.g., with atmospheric\
    \ water vapour, and thus must \nbe analysed with high spectral resolution in the\
    \ SWIR. Figure  4 shows that spectral \nsignatures of soil and NPV, depending\
    \ on the soil brightness, may appear very similar in \nVIS and NIR (Fig. 4a, c)\
    \ or in the SWIR (Fig. 4b, c), respectively. The narrow cellulose \nabsorptions\
    \ in the SWIR, which cannot be discriminated by broadband sensors (dots in \n\
    Fig. 4), must be resolved to discriminate between soil and crop residues.\nFig.\

    3.2  Canopy Biophysical Variables\n3.2.1  Leaf Area Index\nLeaf Area Index (LAI)\
    \ denotes the one-sided leaf surface area per square metre ground \narea, as firstly\
    \ defined by Watson (1947). LAI has a physical unit of  m2 leaf surface per  m2\
    \ \nground surface and therefore is a dimensionless quantity. This variable is\
    \ of specific impor-\ntance for practical farming, since LAI defines the leaf\
    \ surface that is available for exchange \nprocesses between the leaf mesophyll\
    \ and the atmosphere. The entire flux of  CO2 and  O2 \nas well as the absorption\
    \ and emission of radiative energy are scaled via the LAI (Breda \n2003). LAI\
    \ therefore is an important input variable for carbon assimilation models and\
    \ it \nhelps identifying phenological progress (e.g., Savoy and Mackay 2015),\
    \ and the accumula-\ntion of biomass (e.g., Hank et al. 2015; Vaesen et al. 2001).\n\
    For definition, the variable LAI considers the entire leaf surface regardless\
    \ of the leaf \nstate. LAI therefore must be distinguished from green LAI, which\
    \ only takes the photo-\nsynthetically active leaf surface (i.e. the parts of\
    \ the canopy that are characterized by the \npresence of chlorophyll) into account\
    \ (Haboudane et al. 2004). Additional confusion may \narise from using Plant Area\
    \ Index (PAI; Jonckheere et al. 2004). While the LAI by defini-\ntion is limited\
    \ to the leaf fraction of canopies, the PAI takes into account that also stems\
    \ \nand fruits contribute to the canopy surface and, at least during some phenological\
    \ phases, \nalso bear chlorophyll and stomata. Remote sensors, observing the canopy\
    \ from a large dis-\ntance, receive mixed signals from all components of the canopy.\
    \ Moreover, the possible \nnon-random position of all canopy elements, called\
    \ “clumping effect”, influences the spec-\ntral signal. Without correcting for\
    \ clumping, the green LAI or PAI should be considered \nas effective LAI (or PAI;\
    \ Chen and Black 1992; Richter et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the leaf \nsurface\
    \ normally is the most prominently visible physiological element and hence optical\
    \ \nsensors are well suited to measure LAI (Jonckheere et al. 2004; Zheng and\
    \ Moskal 2009). \nVariations in LAI cause variations in reflectance in visible,\
    \ red edge and the NIR spectral \ndomains (Berger et al. 2018; Richter et al.\
    \ 2012; Viña et al. 2011). The more leaf layers are \nstacked on top of each other,\
    \ the higher the reflectance in the NIR will become until satura-\ntion occurs\
    \ (Neuwirthová et al. 2017). LAI retrieval methods consequently are based on \n\
    quantifying the height of the NIR shoulder. Empirical relations between Normalized\
    \ Dif-\nference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Rouse et al. 1973) or similar indices\
    \ and LAI have been \nestablished in the past, which may seem valid for early\
    \ vegetative growth stages, where \nLAI and chlorophyll content develop simultaneously.\
    \ However, a better and more direct \nestimation of LAI is possible when red edge\
    \ and NIR (Kira et al. 2016, 2017; Richter et al. \n2012; Viña et al. 2011) and\
    \ the SWIR domain, which provides information on cellulose \naccumulation (Jacquemoud\
    \ et al. 1996), are analysed simultaneously.\nHyperspectral systems, together\
    \ with physically based or hybrid retrieval methods, can \nhelp to improve the\
    \ estimation accuracy of LAI by providing simultaneous sampling of \nthe chlorophyll\
    \ absorption, the red edge, the NIR shoulder and the SWIR (Lee et al. 2004; \n\
    Liu et al. 2016). This allows assessing the variable LAI directly and discriminating\
    \ the \nstructural variable LAI from the biochemical variable leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content (LCC). It \nhas to be noted that rather precise LAI mapping is also\
    \ possible with advanced multispec-\ntral observation systems, such as ESA’s Sentinel-2\
    \ Multispectral Imager (MSI), which also \ncovers the spectral domain that is\
    \ important for measuring LAI. For precise LAI mapping \nit nonetheless is important\
    \ that the observation and illumination geometry is well known, \nbecause the\
    \ spectral signals of LAI and observation angle overlap strongly in the NIR \n\
    \ 532\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\nshoulder region. Consequently,\
    \ only retrieval methods that are capable of considering non-\nlinear angular\
    \ effects are suited for LAI retrieval, such as the inversion of canopy reflec-\n\
    tance models. These models, among them the PROSAIL model being the most prominently\
    \ \napplied model in the last years for (agricultural) vegetation studies (Berger\
    \ et al. 2018; \nJacquemoud et al. 2009), originally are of a hyperspectral nature,\
    \ because they have been \ndeveloped based on laboratory spectroscopy. Using hyperspectral\
    \ observation systems in \ncombination with hyperspectral canopy reflectance models\
    \ thus is expected to improve the \nstability of LAI mapping from time-series\
    \ observations, which usually are composed of \nimages with different observation\
    \ and illumination angles.\n3.2.2  Average Leaf Inclination Angle\nThe flux of\
    \ solar radiation per unit leaf area is directly determined by the angle of a\
    \ leaf’s \nsurface to the horizontal, i.e. the leaf angle. Whereas steeper leaf\
    \ angles enhance the light \ncapture during low solar zenith angles (early morning/late\
    \ afternoon and winter), they \ndecrease the light absorption during higher solar\
    \ zenith angles (midday and summer; Fal-\nster and Westoby 2003). Therefore, the\
    \ leaf angle is one of the essential factors for plant \nthermoregulation, avoiding\
    \ overheating during midday/summer, while at the same time \nincreasing water\
    \ use efficiency (King 1997).\nThe leaf inclination angle distribution (LAD) is\
    \ commonly categorized into six typi-\ncal types: spherical, planophile, erectophile,\
    \ uniform, extremophile or plagiophile (Liang \n2003). Several mathematical functions,\
    \ i.e. leaf inclination distribution functions (LIDF), \nhave been proposed to\
    \ describe LAD, such as polynomial, ellipsoidal or elliptic distribu-\ntion, which\
    \ in turn can be characterized by the average leaf inclination angle (ALA; Jac-\n\
    quemoud et al. 2000). In particular, the ellipsoidal function has been successfully\
    \ imple-\nmented for the SAIL model (Jacquemoud et al. 2000). ALA and LAD also\
    \ show dynamic \nbehaviour both in diurnal and seasonal cycles, while they may\
    \ also vary in different canopy \nlayers. In the early morning hours, leaves tend\
    \ to be more horizontally inclined. Under \nthe influence of sunlight, the transpiration\
    \ stream in the xylem is activated and the leaves \nassume a more erect position\
    \ due to increased cell turgor. Seasonally, growing plants ini-\ntially penetrate\
    \ the Earth’s surface with vertically inclined leaves. The leaf angle then grad-\n\
    ually declines with progressing phenology until the leaves eventually go limp,\
    \ either tem-\nporarily in phases of drought, or finally when the plant matures.\n\
    ALA is of prominent interest for farming because measuring leaf angles helps keep-\n\
    ing track of the phenological development and potentially allows detecting drought\
    \ situa-\ntions (Zhou et al. 2017). Due to its impact on radiative transfer, it\
    \ also is a very important \ninput parameter for surface energy balance modelling,\
    \ which is a prerequisite for growth \nmodelling.\nIncreasing leaf angles lead\
    \ to reduced reflectance in the NIR shoulder region. This spec-\ntral effect is\
    \ similar to that of decreasing LAI, so that the discrimination of ALA and LAI\
    \ \ninduced effects on canopy reflectance is difficult (Atzberger 2004). Both\
    \ structural vari-\nables are the dominant drivers of canopy reflectance with\
    \ the exception of soil reflectance \nin sparse canopies. However, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors that equally resolve the NIR shoulder \nand the far SWIR potentially\
    \ can help to discriminate these two vegetation traits.\n533\nSurveys in Geophysics\
    \ (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\n3.2.3  Albedo\nThe albedo of (vegetated) land surfaces\
    \ is a non-dimensional ratio of the radiation flux \nreflected from a surface\
    \ unit into the whole hemisphere and the incoming irradiance from \nthe upper\
    \ hemisphere (CEOS 2017). Technically, albedo is known as the bi-hemispheri-\n\
    cal reflectance factor (BHR; Schaepman-Strub et al. 2006), with a value range\
    \ from 0 to \n1. Albedo belongs to the group of Essential Climate Variables (ECV)\
    \ as defined by the \nGlobal Climate Observing System (GCOS) and requires measurement\
    \ uncertainty of maxi-\nmal 5% (0.0025) for climate change monitoring purposes.\n\
    Moreover, albedo is an essential input parameter for the calculation of evapotranspi-\n\
    ration (ET; Su 2002). ET, combining evaporation and transpiration fluxes from\
    \ the veg-\netated surface to the atmosphere, plays a key role in the water and\
    \ energy balance on the \nEarth’s surface and thus is of particular interest for\
    \ agriculture regarding irrigation man-\nagement (D’Urso et al. 2010). The advantage\
    \ of hyperspectral satellite data in estimating \nsurface broadband albedo can\
    \ be found in the continuous sampling of the electromagnetic \nspectrum.\n3.2.4\
    \  Fractional Vegetation Cover\nThe fractional vegetation cover (fCover) corresponds\
    \ to the complement of the gap fraction \nin nadir direction (Weiss et al. 2000).\
    \ FCover is intrinsic to the vegetation canopy implying \nthat it does not depend\
    \ on illumination geometry. Since fCover belongs to the group of the \nmain biophysical\
    \ variables and is involved in agriculturally relevant surface processes such\
    \ \nas erosion or interception of precipitation, it sometimes can be considered\
    \ as an indicator \nof land degradation and thus is important for regional and\
    \ global climate (change) model-\nling, and global change monitoring (Jiménez-Muñoz\
    \ et al. 2009). Fractional cover is a vari-\nable that normally becomes visible\
    \ at scales below the geometric resolution of optical sen-\nsors (e.g., Gitelson\
    \ 2013). Delineation of fractional cover therefore is a prominent example \nfor\
    \ spectral unmixing techniques, where hyperspectral data provide improved unambigu-\n\
    ousness compared to multispectral data, as has been demonstrated for example by\
    \ Asner \nand Heidebrecht (2002).\n3.2.5  Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically\
    \ Active Radiation\nThe fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (fAPAR) constitutes a key \nvariable for the energy and carbon balance of ecosystems\
    \ for various temporal and spatial \nscales (Gobron and Verstraete 2009). fAPAR\
    \ depends on canopy structure, optical proper-\nties of plant components and on\
    \ illumination conditions and is very useful as input to a \nnumber of primary\
    \ production models and thus to agricultural information systems.\nToday, several\
    \ operational coarse resolution fAPAR products are available, approximat-\ning\
    \ the daily-integrated value (e.g., the 10:30 solar time instantaneous black-sky\
    \ fAPAR at \ntime of sensor overpass). NASA, for instance, provides MODIS/TERRA\
    \ fAPAR Collec-\ntion 5 products (MOD15A2) continuously since 2000 through the\
    \ U.S. Geological Survey \nportal (Martínez et al. 2013).\nThe use of hyperspectral\
    \ data for fAPAR delineation seems logical, because only con-\ntinuous spectral\
    \ sampling over the VIS spectral domain can measure the amount of radia-\ntion\
    \ that is absorbed by the leaf. Since fAPAR and fCover are secondary variables,\
    \ which \n 534\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\nare calculated from\
    \ primary state variables such as LAI and LCC describing structure and \noptical\
    \ properties of leaves and canopy (Weiss et al. 2000), highly accurate estimations\
    \ of \nprimary state variables from hyperspectral data also contribute to improved\
    \ information on \nsecondary variables.\n3.2.6  Solar‑Induced Fluorescence\nSolar\
    \ radiative energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in leaves will exit the leaf\
    \ again \nvia three main de-excitation mechanisms: (1) driving photosynthesis,\
    \ (2) excess energy \ndissipation as heat or (3) re-emission in the form of chlorophyll\
    \ fluorescence (ChlF; Max-\nwell and Johnson 2000). Since these three mechanisms\
    \ are coupled, ChlF emitted by veg-\netation can be seen as indicator of the instantaneous\
    \ plant photosynthetic functioning (e.g., \ncarbon fixation). ChlF carries information\
    \ on LUE and therefore captures the dynamic \nbehaviour of photosynthesis, or\
    \ gross primary productivity (GPP), at the relevant scale \n(Porcar-Castell et al.\
    \ 2014; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2013a, 2016). Indirectly, ChlF can be used \nto detect\
    \ stress in the actual functional status of vegetation before a response in LCC\
    \ or \nLAI becomes visible (Meroni et  al. 2009). Remote sensing techniques offer\
    \ the unique \nability to assess photosynthesis continuously over large areas\
    \ by quantifying solar-induced \nchlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from satellite\
    \ or airborne platforms. Unfortunately, the sig-\nnal is very small compared to\
    \ land surface reflectance, so that the radiometric sensitivity \nof the sensors\
    \ in most cases limits the geometric resolution of SIF that can be achieved. \n\
    Due to that, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for near-range SIF sensing\
    \ is \npromising for some agricultural applications: e.g., key drought-related\
    \ variables could be \nobtained via ChlF signals using a micro-hyperspectral imager\
    \ on board a UAV (Murchie \nand Lawson 2013; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2012). Moreover,\
    \ ChlF imaging is recognized as a \nwell-established effective tool for the assessment\
    \ of bacterial, fungal and viral infections \non crop leaves (Bauriegel et al.\
    \ 2011). For a comprehensive review of the topic see Mer-\noni et al. (2009).\
    \ Multispectral systems are not able to provide appropriate SIF signals for \n\
    land surface applications, because the SIF signal is obscured by the bright reflectance\
    \ of \nthe land surface in the far red. To discriminate the SIF signal, very high\
    \ spectral resolu-\ntion is required to measure the fluorescence spectrum within\
    \ the two oxygen absorption \nbands  (O2A and  O2B), where interference with land\
    \ surface reflectance is avoided. Data of \nthis kind will for instance be provided\
    \ by the FLEX (Fluorescence Explorer) mission. The \nFLORIS (Fluorescence Imaging\
    \ Spectrometer) instrument on FLEX will provide very high \nspectral resolution\
    \ data with 0.3 nm in the spectral domain of the oxygen absorption bands \n(Coppo\
    \ et al. 2017). To discriminate the different energy pathways in the leaf, also\
    \ leaf \ntemperature and the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (APAR) must \nbe measured. While the temperature measurements can be provided\
    \ by thermal imagers, \ne.g., in the case of FLEX this is achieved through a tandem\
    \ orbit with Sentinel-3, APAR \ncan be measured via spectroscopy. Remote measurements\
    \ of photosynthetic activity via \nSIF therefore combine high spectral resolution\
    \ and spectrally continuous sampling and \nthus are a true and exclusive hyperspectral\
    \ application.\nCurrently, the limited spatial resolution of spaceborne SIF instruments—the\
    \ future \nFLEX mission, for instance, will provide 300  m geometric resolution—does\
    \ not allow \nsmall-scale precision farming applications of SIF products. Newest\
    \ findings, however, \nreveal that SIF can potentially be used to discriminate\
    \ between different sources of crop \nstress, e.g., water-, temperature-, nitrogen-stress\
    \ (Ač et  al. 2015), making SIF measure-\nments one of the most promising future\
    \ applications in precision farming. To optimally \n535\nSurveys in Geophysics\
    \ (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\nexploit SIF signals from large areas for practical\
    \ farming, future hyperspectral satellite sen-\nsors should aim to simultaneously\
    \ provide adequate high spectral (~ 0.3 nm) and high spa-\ntial resolution (~\
    \ 20 m).\n3.3  Soil and Land Cover Variables\n3.3.1  Soil Organic Carbon Content\n\
    Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is a key soil property. Hyperspectral remote\
    \ sensing \nof SOC effectively supports the identification of several environmental\
    \ concerns, such as \nsoil erosion (e.g., caused by tillage), salinity or soil\
    \ contamination (Vaudour et al. 2016). \nNumerous studies have demonstrated the\
    \ usefulness of imaging spectroscopy to predict \nSOC compared to time-consuming\
    \ field-based methods (Castaldi et al. 2018; Forkuor et al. \n2017). A good overview\
    \ of the use of airborne hyperspectral imagery for the monitoring of \nSOC contents\
    \ at within-field scale is given by Vaudour et al. (2016).\n3.3.2  Land Use/Land\
    \ Cover\nThe ability of hyperspectral sensors to differentiate terrestrial features\
    \ by unique spectral \nsignatures is very valuable for classifying distinct land\
    \ use/cover features, in particular of \nthe vegetative (cropped) surface. Accurate\
    \ and detailed land use and land cover monitoring \nis a prerequisite for documenting\
    \ farming activities such as crop rotation, or intertillage in \nparticular for\
    \ large agricultural areas. Several studies exploited hyperspectral data capabili-\n\
    ties for agricultural land cover classifications and found improvements over multispectral\
    \ \ndata (Thenkabail et al. 2004). From a practical farming point of view, increased\
    \ informa-\ntion depth of land cover maps is of particular interest. Hyperspectral\
    \ sensors providing \ndetailed spectral analysis of pigment composition can be\
    \ a key for species and/or weed \ndiscrimination (Sykas et al. 2013).\n4  Advantages\
    \ of Hyperspectral Versus Multispectral Sensing \nin an Agricultural Context\n\
    The rare availability of spaceborne hyperspectral sensors has led to an exchange\
    \ of \narguments between promoters of multispectral and hyperspectral data. Since\
    \ the con-\nstruction of hyperspectral sensors compared to multispectral instruments\
    \ is complicated \nas well as expensive, users of hyperspectral sensing are encouraged\
    \ to carefully justify \nthe requirement for high spectral resolution as well\
    \ as for full spectral coverage for their \nspecific application. While the positive\
    \ aspects of high spectral resolution can easily be \ndemonstrated for specific\
    \ applications (e.g., high spectral resolution is needed to dis-\ncern narrow\
    \ absorptions of different pigments for vegetation studies, see Sect. 3), the\
    \ \nbenefits generated from spectrally continuous sampling cannot be explained\
    \ in such a \nstraightforward way. In some cases, the detection problems in the\
    \ case of vegetation \ncan indeed be solved by adding one or two very specific\
    \ bands, while still maintaining a \nmultispectral setup. For instance, the ESA\
    \ Sentinel-2 MSI was equipped with two extra \nbands that now can be used to characterize\
    \ the shape of the chlorophyll absorption. For \nvegetation science in an agricultural\
    \ context, the benefits from continuous spectral sam-\npling rather can be found\
    \ in the fact that the spectral response of different biophysical/\n 536\nSurveys\
    \ in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\nbiochemical traits are interacting with\
    \ each other across different parts of the electro-\nmagnetic spectrum. Changes\
    \ in canopy structure, which can be observed in the NIR/\nSWIR, will influence\
    \ the way in which variations in plant chemistry can be observed \nin the VIS.\
    \ Constructing observation systems that are capable of tracking only selected\
    \ \nparts of the spectrum thus limits the quality of the analysis.\nThe exhaustive\
    \ description of variables with relevance for practical farming in \nSect.  3 \
    \ has shown that the number of different traits targeted with remote sensing \n\
    largely exceeds the number of spectral bands of conventional multispectral sensors.\
    \ To \navoid underdetermined problems, additional spectral measurements are inevitable.\
    \ Con-\nsequently, hyperspectral approaches already have contributed largely to\
    \ a more effective \nand more detailed use and exploitation of remotely sensed\
    \ data in precision agriculture \n(Nellis et al. 2009). Several studies exploited\
    \ hyperspectral data capabilities for agricul-\ntural land cover classifications.\
    \ For agricultural crop species discrimination, Thenka-\nbail et al. (2004) found\
    \ an increase in classification accuracy of up to 43% when using \nhyperspectral\
    \ bands compared to broadband Landsat (ETM +). Although there are many \nexamples\
    \ for improved retrieval accuracy, in some cases hyperspectral data may not pro-\n\
    vide significant improvement for variable retrieval (Broge and Leblanc 2001; Spanner\
    \ \net al. 1994). Even then, hyperspectral data have large potential to reduce\
    \ retrieval uncer-\ntainties and thus enhance accuracy and stability of the biophysical\
    \ and biochemical \nproducts indirectly. Although some studies confirm this, e.g.,\
    \ Liu et al. (2016), Richter \net al. (2012), Verrelst et al. (2016), still more\
    \ research is needed to properly quantify the \ngain of hyperspectral measurements\
    \ compared to multispectral data for specific applica-\ntions. Generally, advantages\
    \ of imaging spectroscopy for agriculture can be summarized \nas follows:\n• Higher\
    \ accuracy of variable retrieval (Lee et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2016);\n• Reduced\
    \ uncertainties in space and time (Ustin et al. 2001);\n• Improved automatic interpretation\
    \ of EO signals by spectrally separating atmosphere, \nsoil, leaves and canopy\
    \ effects, since ambiguities are reduced;\n• Higher accuracy of crop species discrimination\
    \ (Thenkabail et al. 2004).\n• Novel approaches that provide access to variables\
    \ hidden for multispectral sensors, e.g., \nSIF.\nTo make these potentials of\
    \ hyperspectral data accessible for agricultural management, pre-\nprocessing\
    \ is required to address the problems associated with the high spectral dimension-\n\
    ality provided by hyperspectral sensors: long processing times and the “curse\
    \ of dimen-\nsionality” or Hughes phenomenon. Several approaches exist to solve\
    \ these issues and to \nconcurrently optimize the retrieval of the variables of\
    \ interest. In the spectral domain, for \ninstance, feature (band) selection,\
    \ feature extraction or dimensionality reduction (DR) tech-\nniques can be applied\
    \ (Rivera-Caicedo et al. 2017; van der Maaten et al. 2009). This may \ninclude\
    \ band selection procedures for individual variable retrievals, as for instance\
    \ per-\nformed by Verrelst et al. (2016), who, using two airborne hyperspectral\
    \ datasets, identified \nthe most sensitive spectral bands for LCC, LAI and CWC\
    \ measurements. Another example \nfor successful band selection was provided by\
    \ Thenkabail et al. (2004), who identified a \nhyperspectral set of optimal bands\
    \ that best characterize agricultural crop types. The ben-\nefits of hyperspectral\
    \ sensing for crop discrimination can be traced to the fact that different \n\
    cultivars may show subtle differences in colour (the green colour of the leaves\
    \ either shift-\ning towards the blue or towards yellowish tones), which cannot\
    \ be resolved by multispec-\ntral sensors. This positive aspect of hyperspectral\
    \ sensing so far has not been adequately \n537\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\
    \ \n1 3\nstudied and provides a promising opportunity for more research, once\
    \ hyperspectral sens-\ning from space becomes operational.\nApart from the discipline-specific\
    \ advantages listed above, bringing hyperspectral \nobservation systems into orbit\
    \ also enables the use of one sensor for a wide range of dif-\nferent applications.\
    \ While high spectral resolution may be required for water analysis \nabove all\
    \ in the VIS, geological applications will require the same spectral resolution\
    \ in \nthe SWIR. Vegetation studies again, be it for agricultural applications,\
    \ for natural ecosys-\ntems research, or for combined studies investigating the\
    \ neighbouring effects of managed \nand natural vegetation, will require the full\
    \ range of the spectrum. Instead of constructing \na number of different multispectral\
    \ satellites tuned to either application, a hyperspectral \nsensor can easily\
    \ serve different applications and the data may be shared across disciplines \n\
    following the “one key fits all” principle.\nAlmost no experience so far exists\
    \ with the use of spaceborne hyperspectral EO, sim-\nply because no operational\
    \ high-quality system has successfully been installed yet. The \nnew kind of data\
    \ expected from future hyperspectral spaceborne EO missions may enable \nthe development\
    \ of innovative analysis methods and applications. Hyperspectral algorithm \n\
    development for vegetation studies so far has been mostly limited to airborne\
    \ data, which \nis very heterogeneous in quality, temporal availability and spatial\
    \ coverage. Hyperspectral \nalgorithms thus are limited in terms of transferability\
    \ across sensors and space and cannot \nmake full use of the temporal signal,\
    \ which is of predominant importance for vegetation \nstudies. The temporal characteristics\
    \ of vegetation development will perfectly be incorpo-\nrated in hyperspectral\
    \ time-series, because spaceborne hyperspectral systems will enable \nrepeated\
    \ measurements of the reflectance of the Earth’s surface with homogeneous quality\
    \ \nand characteristics all around the globe by applying the same instrument at\
    \ every location \n(Houborg et al. 2017).\nThe installation of hyperspectral sensors\
    \ thereby will not make the construction of mul-\ntispectral systems obsolete,\
    \ but rather will trigger new developments also in the multispec-\ntral domain.\
    \ For instance, the adding of specific spectral bands to multispectral observation\
    \ \nsystems to assist detecting specific phenomena, such as red edge, can be traced\
    \ back to \nhyperspectral studies, which have been used to define the position\
    \ of these bands (Clevers \net al. 2001).\nDue to the contradicting effects of\
    \ increased information content, which comes along \nwith increased noise, the\
    \ margins of increased accuracy may only be small for some vari-\nables. However,\
    \ most of the variables retrieved from remote sensing are not used directly, \n\
    but rather are assimilated into complex decision support information systems (e.g.,\
    \ Hank \net al. 2015). According to the laws of error propagation, even small\
    \ margins of increased \naccuracy may reduce uncertainties in a processing chain\
    \ significantly. Besides that, some \nvariables can only be uniquely addressed\
    \ with hyperspectral sensors, because narrow-band \nhigh-resolution data are required\
    \ with the ability to discriminate components that may be \ngrouped by multispectral\
    \ bands (Adão et al. 2017):\n• Hyperspectral data offer the possibility to retrieve\
    \ biochemicals via specific pigments \nsuch as chlorophyll, anthocyanins or carotenoids,\
    \ and thus give farmers access to pri-\nmary production, pest and disease monitoring.\n\
    • Hyperspectral data allow discriminating the absorptions of atmospheric water\
    \ vapour \nfrom those of cellulose and lignin to quantify non-photosynthetic vegetation\
    \ and thus \ngive farmers access to improved crop residue management.\n• Hyperspectral\
    \ data support the discrimination of the three phases of water (ice, liquid, \n\
    gas; Green et al. 2006) and thus give farmers access to plant water status monitoring.\n\
    \ 538\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\n• Hyperspectral data can\
    \ help to discriminate protein absorptions from the overlaying \ncellulose, lignin\
    \ and water absorptions and thus give farmers access to improved fertili-\nzation\
    \ efficiency monitoring.\n• Hyperspectral sensing, by combining the strengths\
    \ of high resolution and wide range \ncontinuous spectral sampling, is the only\
    \ technique that allows tracing the pathways of \nenergy transformation in the\
    \ leaves of living vegetation via solar-induced fluorescence \nand thus gives\
    \ farmers access to investigating impacts of different stress sources (tem-\n\
    perature, nitrogen, water).\n5  Mission Requirements\nThis paper reviewed the\
    \ potentials of spaceborne spectroscopy missions for agriculture. It \nlargely\
    \ discussed aspects of EO, which have not been sufficiently addressed with currently\
    \ \navailable EO systems. The elements described in this study rather draw a picture\
    \ of pos-\nsible improvements and new possibilities using future operational imaging\
    \ spectroscopy \nspace missions. The following collection of requirements, where\
    \ no claim is made of com-\npleteness, is meant to shape this vision with special\
    \ emphasis on the challenges, which are \nencountered when applying hyperspectral\
    \ data in the context of practical agriculture.\n5.1  User Requirements for Satellite‑Based\
    \ Technologies\nProviding large amounts of satellite data will not per se contribute\
    \ to the implementation of \nmore efficient farming strategies. Users of satellite-based\
    \ information in practical agricul-\nture rather require elaborated information\
    \ products, which must be tailored to the specific \nneeds of farm management.\
    \ The continuous stream of data, which is generated by EO mis-\nsions, must be\
    \ transferred into information products, which assist farmers with decisions on\
    \ \nmanagement actions such as irrigation, fertilization or plant protection.\
    \ A selection of bio-\nphysical and biochemical variables, also defined as Level\
    \ 2B/3 products including fAPAR, \nLAI, fCover or LCC, is usually generated by\
    \ special service providers such as the Sentinel \ntoolboxes (Weiss and Baret\
    \ 2016). To integrate the satellite-based measurements into farm-\ning practice,\
    \ these variables identified as agriculturally relevant in Sect. 3 (Table 1) need\
    \ \nto be further refined to directly address the requirements of individual farmers\
    \ for specific \nfarming decisions. For instance, for fertilization planning,\
    \ the absolute amount of nitrogen \n(N) actually stored in the leaves and especially\
    \ in the grains as well as the remaining N \nstorage in the soil is needed (in\
    \ kg N  ha−1). For plant protection and yield management, \nspatial maps of dry\
    \ biomass in leaves, stems and grains, provided in units of g dry matter \n m−2\
    \ ground surface, are important. The biophysical and biochemical agriculturally\
    \ relevant \nvariables, which are directly derived from remote sensing, therefore\
    \ must be processed to \nhigher-level information products, e.g., by assimilating\
    \ them into models of agricultural \nproduction and by embedding them into integrated\
    \ information systems, which then pro-\nvide decision-supporting guidance to farmers.\
    \ To render these EO products valuable for \nprecision agriculture and to increase\
    \ their acceptance in practical farming, according to the \nexperience of the\
    \ authors, the following user requirements apply:\n• Data Accuracy Accuracies\
    \ must be optimized and remaining uncertainties must be \nclearly defined. According\
    \ to the laws of error propagation, even small margins of \nincreased accuracy\
    \ at the beginning of a processing chain can have large impact on the \n539\n\
    Surveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551 \n1 3\naccuracy of the final result. This\
    \ applies especially for the variables retrieved from EO, \nwhich are used as\
    \ spatial input parameters for models of agricultural production. As has \nbeen\
    \ elaborated in Sects. 3 and 4, hyperspectral data can help minimizing uncertain-\n\
    ties by providing measurements of very specific variables and by contributing\
    \ to more \naccurate and stable retrievals. Accuracies with respect to information\
    \ content must \nexceed the expert’s present capabilities of estimating a variable’s\
    \ value. Uncertainties \nof satellite-based products normally are defined through\
    \ comparison with in situ meas-\nurements. These measurements again are subject\
    \ to errors depending on the variable \nmeasured and the sampling method applied.\
    \ The error of the in situ measurement thus \ndefines the maximum detectable accuracy\
    \ of a satellite measurement. In order to base \nthe decision-making of farmers\
    \ on remotely sensed products, the retrieval uncertain-\nties therefore should\
    \ not exceed the uncertainties of in situ measurements. However, \none has to\
    \ realize that in situ measurements mostly are point measurements, whereas \n\
    farmers need so-called task maps, indicating zones in a field that should be treated\
    \ as a \nseparate unit with respect to irrigation, fertilization or plant protection.\
    \ A big advantage \nof satellite data is the provision of spatial data or maps.\n\
    • Spatial Accuracy Most information in the context of precision farming refers\
    \ to spatial \ndatasets, which provide decision-supporting guidance to farmers\
    \ by being used as map-\noverlay for the spatial execution of actual management\
    \ measures. Since spatial applica-\ntions in practical farming are frequently\
    \ based on very high precision navigation, such \nas real-time-kinematic (RTK)\
    \ in combination with auto-steering, geometric accuracy \nmust be high, i.e. in\
    \ the metre domain.\n• Time Constraints Growing crops is a temporally highly dynamic\
    \ process, which \nrequires different management decisions throughout a growing\
    \ cycle. For all decisions, \nup-to-date spatial information on crop and/or soil\
    \ status is required. Three important \ntime-related aspects must be considered:\
    \ sensor repetition rate, time for data-processing \nand transfer of the products\
    \ to the users. Since farm management measures usually are \nplanned in accordance\
    \ with the short-term weather forecast, the actual design of the \nmeasures occurs\
    \ on very short notice, i.e. one or two days in advance. Near real-time \ntransfer\
    \ of the EO-based information products to the users thus is fundamental. Since\
    \ \nthe satellite data must be processed and ingested into the final information\
    \ products, the \ntransfer time of the actual satellite data to the value-adding\
    \ agents must be kept as short \nas possible (< 3 h).\n• Cost Efficiency Apart\
    \ from ecological motivation, profit is the major driver in agricul-\ntural innovation.\
    \ The amount of money a farm is going to invest in optimized produc-\ntion depends\
    \ on the revenue, which is expected from the measure. For site-specific \nmeasures,\
    \ the potential savings in terms of labour, fuel, machinery hours, fertilizers,\
    \ \nplant protection agents, water, etc. and the potential increase in revenues\
    \ in terms of \nhigher yield levels and higher yield quality largely depend on\
    \ the spatial heterogeneity \nof the managed sites. The willingness to invest\
    \ in spatial information therefore depends \non the cost efficiency of the solution.\n\
    5.2  Observational Requirements for Satellite‑Based Technologies\nAs has been\
    \ described in Sect.  4, hyperspectral satellite missions can potentially be \n\
    applied to a wide range of different scientific and practical questions. The technical\
    \ \nrequirements for an imaging spectroscopy mission should not be exclusively\
    \ driven by a \n 540\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n1 3\nsingle application.\
    \ Nonetheless, from the user requirements for agricultural applications \nlisted\
    \ in Sect. 5.1, some requirements for the design of satellite missions can be\
    \ derived:\n• Spatial Resolution The central application of satellite data in\
    \ agriculture is improved \nspatial parameterization of models, which are used\
    \ as decision support systems for \nsite-specific management measures. The requirements\
    \ for spatial resolution thus are \ndetermined by the spatial detail with which\
    \ farmers are capable of applying meas-\nures on their fields. This level of spatial\
    \ detail currently is limited by the size and \ntype of the available agricultural\
    \ machinery (fertilizer spreaders, irrigation systems, \netc.). Fertilizer spreaders,\
    \ as they are nowadays applied, usually have working widths \nof 40 m. A ground\
    \ sampling distance (GSD) of 20 m thus would optimally resolve \nground heterogeneities\
    \ for the use with these machines, while a GSD of 30 m can be \nconsidered to\
    \ represent the upper limit. However, technology is constantly evolving \ntowards\
    \ finer resolution. For instance, newest spreader and irrigation systems allow\
    \ \nfor an independent adjustment of individual sprayer nozzles along the boom.\
    \ A GSD \nof 10 metres consequently should be targeted for future missions.\n\
    • Spectral Resolution Biophysical/biochemical information exhibits various absorp-\n\
    tion types. For proteins, lignin and cellulose, exhibiting rather shallow but\
    \ broad \nabsorption features, moderate spectral resolution of about 10 nm in\
    \ the SWIR seems \nto be adequate. Other variables instead, such as anthocyanin\
    \ and carotene, show \nmore narrow absorptions in the VIS and therefore should\
    \ be addressed at higher \nspectral resolutions of approx. 6  nm. This level of\
    \ spectral resolution seems rea-\nsonable for spaceborne missions from a technical\
    \ point of view. However, for the \nexploitation of SIF signals on the land surface\
    \ very high spectral resolution < 3 nm \nwould be required. The provision of such\
    \ high spectral resolutions conflicts with the \nrequirements for spatial resolution\
    \ described above.\n• Spectral Coverage According to Fig. 3, the spectral features\
    \ which give access to \nbiophysical/biochemical properties are distributed over\
    \ a spectral range between 400 \nand 2500 nm. While some variables can be targeted\
    \ through specific narrow absorp-\ntions, others require analysing contiguous\
    \ bands. The so-called full range spectral \ncoverage thus should be aimed for.\n\
    • Radiometric Quality Especially for hyperspectral systems, where the limited\
    \ amount \nof available reflected energy is divided into small portions of the\
    \ electromagnetic \nspectrum, radiometric quality is of utmost importance for\
    \ the success of a satellite \nmission. Since the analysis of vegetation biophysical/biochemical\
    \ properties is based \non different parts of the spectrum, the considered absorptions\
    \ can either be narrow \nor shallow or both. Accurate variable retrieval requires\
    \ both, high signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) as well as high radiometric resolution.\
    \ Since SNR is highly determined \nthrough the characteristics of the detector,\
    \ it usually decreases with increasing wave-\nlength. For the agriculturally relevant\
    \ variables addressed by this study, a minimum \nSNR of approx. 500 in the VNIR\
    \ and not lower than 150 in the SWIR should be tar-\ngeted.\n• Radiometric Resolution\
    \ Imaging spectroscopy is characterized by high amounts of \ndata. To ensure the\
    \ success of spaceborne missions, it would be reasonable to keep \ndata rates\
    \ as low as possible. However, to adequately resolve also subtle differences in\
    \ \nreflectance as caused by shallow absorptions, at least 14-bit quantification\
    \ should be \naimed at.\n• Repeat Cycle The data from an operational mission can\
    \ be used in nearly all stages of \nthe crop cycle. The phenological development\
    \ of crops occurs in time-steps of weeks \n541\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\
    \ \n1 3\nrather than months. Taking the problems of cloud cover for an optical\
    \ mission into \naccount, a revisit time of 5 days would be optimal.\n• Platform\
    \ Agility Atmospheric correction is a very important but also critical task for\
    \ \nthe proper use of hyperspectral imagery. Hyperspectral atmospheric retrieval\
    \ algo-\nrithms, being developed based on airborne measurements, are able to deal\
    \ with reflec-\ntance anisotropies. Thus, repeated data takes for the compilation\
    \ of time-series do not \nnecessarily need to be conducted at nadir but could\
    \ also be achieved through across-\ntrack pointing. Vegetation canopies show strong\
    \ anisotropy effects through various \ngeometric complexities. Therefore, pointing\
    \ capabilities of future satellite sensors, both \nacross and along track, could\
    \ help to improve variable retrieval and thus could trigger \nthe development\
    \ of new or more sophisticated multiangular retrieval techniques.\n• Spatial Coverage\
    \ Since agriculture happens globally and ensuring food security is a \nglobal\
    \ challenge, the data should at least cover the global croplands between 49°S\
    \ and \n66°N, amounting to 1.873 billion hectares of land surface (Thenkabail\
    \ 2017).\n• Data Policy The successful transfer of environmental information into\
    \ practical agricul-\nture largely depends on the acceptance of the guiding information\
    \ by farmers. Accept-\nance is generated from high quality and reasonable pricing\
    \ of the data products. Tak-\ning into account that the actual value for practical\
    \ farming cannot be found in the data \nitself, but rather enters the product\
    \ by processing and value adding, data costs should be \nkept as low as possible.\
    \ Apart from commercial applications, continuous high-quality \ndata from a hyperspectral\
    \ mission would also be important for science and education. \nFollowing the example\
    \ of large operational missions such as Landsat or Copernicus, \nalso the data\
    \ from future hyperspectral missions should be open, free and easily acces-\n\
    sible.\nThe technical requirements summarized in this section were compiled from\
    \ a scientific \npoint of view, mostly neglecting technical and financial difficulties.\
    \ Although we took care \nnot to reach too far from technical feasibility, we\
    \ are aware that not all of the listed require-\nments will be feasible in the\
    \ short term and not by one sensor only. Possible trade-offs \nbetween the different\
    \ requirements therefore must be taken into account, which may be \njudged very\
    \ differently depending on the application. We believe that some of the valuable\
    \ \nwork currently done in the context of preparing spectroscopy missions worldwide\
    \ should \nbe directed to define priorities for technical requirements in a quantitative\
    \ way.\n6  Challenges and Future Directions\nCurrently observed large-scale global\
    \ developments, such as climate, population and land \nuse changes, challenge\
    \ the suppliers of food, fibre and energy to a most efficient use of the \nbioproductive\
    \ land surface. This paper aimed at summarizing the potential contributions of\
    \ \nspaceborne imaging spectroscopy to increased efficiency in practical farming\
    \ and derived \nsome user and mission requirements from the state of the art as\
    \ it has been documented in \nthe literature. Although scientific techniques,\
    \ such as multi-sensor data fusion and 3D mod-\nelling, potentially allow for\
    \ using spaceborne data also for very small-scale applications, \nwe think that\
    \ the main use of future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data in operational \n\
    precision farming will take place on the spatial scale of the satellite data.\
    \ Accordingly, \nthe findings with respect to the variables and retrieval techniques\
    \ described here mainly \napply to homogeneous crop farming, i.e. to crops that\
    \ form geometrically homogeneous \n 542\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019) 40:515–551\n\
    1 3\nstands compared to the observation scale of spaceborne sensors and which\
    \ are cultivated \nin areas with individual field sizes in the order of 1 hectare\
    \ and above. Special cultures like \nvineyards, orchards, plantations may have\
    \ different requirements, mostly with respect to \nspatial resolution (e.g., Zarco-Tejada\
    \ et al. 2013b), which were not reflected in the mission \nrequirements summarized\
    \ in Sect. 5. Also, smallholder farming, which still is practized \non about 12%\
    \ of global farmland (Lowder et al. 2016), probably will most likely not be \n\
    able to adapt the new technologies in near future. Efficiency in agriculture is\
    \ not limited to \ncrop farming; a large part of farming is concerned with livestock\
    \ husbandry. This implies \nfor instance the monitoring of different grassland\
    \ biophysical or biochemical variables for \nthe derivation of management characteristics\
    \ such as degradation or grazing intensity. In \nsummary, for the case of homogeneous\
    \ crop farming, several variables have been identified \nand described, which\
    \ can be measured by hyperspectral sensors and which provide crucial \ninformation\
    \ for decision support tools in the context of farm management. The door for \n\
    those tools, to enter into practical farming, already is wide open because of\
    \ several reasons:\n• Service providers exist and are growing, who offer EO-based\
    \ information in an integra-\ntive way, so that farmers do not need to specialize\
    \ in Earth Observation or Geographi-\ncal Information Systems themselves.\n• Most\
    \ of the farming equipment installed today is capable of performing at least simple\
    \ \nvariable rate applications, e.g., through variable forward motion speed, which\
    \ can be \nused for site-specific management measures. Meanwhile, technology is\
    \ rapidly evolv-\ning, continuously introducing new site-specific management options.\
    \ The concept of \nfertigation, where fertilization and irrigation management\
    \ are coupled through a single \nspreader system, is one example.\n• Finally yet\
    \ importantly, farmers already are used to trust spectroscopy measurements, \n\
    because near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a standard tool in animal feed analy-\n\
    sis (e.g., for measuring residual moisture, crude protein, crude oils and fats,\
    \ starch, \nsugar, acid/neutral detergent fibre). However, spectroscopy in agricultural\
    \ practice so \nfar mainly is limited to laboratory spectroscopy and/or near-range\
    \ measurements, e.g., \ninside harvesters.\nTo introduce information derived from\
    \ spaceborne spectroscopy into agricultural manage-\nment practice, farmers need\
    \ to be convinced. They will base their decisions on satellite \nspectroscopy,\
    \ if high quality and high stability of the spatial measurements can be demon-\n\
    strated and confirmed. This can only be achieved through global satellite missions,\
    \ which \nare operated based on a dedicated acquisition plan. If high-quality\
    \ datasets can be com-\npiled on a regular basis, this would allow for a frequent\
    \ collection of in situ data through \ndedicated field campaigns and long-term\
    \ instrumented outdoor research sites. The high \nspatial and temporal coverage\
    \ as well as the fact that the same instruments are globally \napplied through\
    \ a satellite mission will allow for testing the transferability of all retrieval\
    \ \napproaches that have been developed so far using ground-based or airborne\
    \ data. Moreo-\nver, future hyperspectral spaceborne data sets will trigger the\
    \ development of new and so \nfar unknown applications. The sensor requirements\
    \ for measuring relevant agricultural var-\niables are very diverse. An imaging\
    \ spectrometer designed according to the requirements \nsummarized in this document\
    \ surely is the key to answering some of the questions. Nev-\nertheless, some\
    \ applications will require different specifications that cannot be achieved \n\
    with a single instrument. For example, the exploitation of SIF for agricultural\
    \ purposes \nwill not only need a high-resolution full-range spectrometer, but\
    \ will additionally require \nultra-high spectral resolution in selected parts\
    \ of the electromagnetic spectrum and surface \n543\nSurveys in Geophysics (2019)\
    \ 40:515–551 \n1 3\ntemperature measurements at the same time. Installing different\
    \ instruments along one \norbit to follow each other in a so-called train constellation\
    \ would be a sensible strategy, \nallowing the integration of new technologies\
    \ into the chain as they become available. Also, \nvegetation is a dynamic surface,\
    \ which shows strong diurnal and seasonal variations. To \nexploit the full potential\
    \ of multiangular observations, a tandem concept of two identical \ninstruments\
    \ in parallel flight could be envisioned. Current ambitious satellite programs,\
    \ \nsuch as the ESA Copernicus program, already have proven that Earth Observation\
    \ activi-\nties with data rates in the domain of 10 Petabyte per year are technically\
    \ feasible. The even \nincreased data rates expected with high-resolution spectroscopy\
    \ missions will pose new \nchallenges for efficient data downlinking, data storage\
    \ and data distribution. Advanced on-\nboard processing strategies should be developed\
    \ to mitigate the data rate problems.\nAlthough information derived from spaceborne\
    \ imaging spectroscopy can be applied \nto increase efficiency in agricultural\
    \ production, one question cannot yet conclusively be \nanswered: Will increased\
    \ efficiency in agricultural production also result in sustainabil-\nity, and\
    \ if so, to what degree? This issue will have to be investigated by future long-term\
    \ \nstudies.\nAcknowledgements The paper arises from the Workshop on “Exploring\

    Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), or AI/machine vision, is assuming an overwhelming
    part in the realm of food handling and quality

    aﬃrmation. As indicated by Mordor Intelligence, AI in the food and refreshments
    market is required to enlist a CAGR of 28.64%,

    during the conjecture time frame 2018–2023. Artiﬁcial intelligence makes it workable
    for PCs to gain as a matter of fact, investigate

    information from the two data sources and yields, and perform most human assignments
    with an improved level of accuracy and

    proﬁciency. Here is a concise gander at how AI is expanding sanitation and quality
    activities. Tis exploration has along these lines

    tried to furnish policymakers with a way to assess new and existing strategies,
    while likewise oﬀering a reasonable premise through

    which food chains orders can be made stronger through the thought of the executive’s
    practices and strategy choices. Tis survey

    centers on the AI applications according to four mainstays of food security that
    is food accessibility, food availability, food use,

    and strength.

    1. Introduction

    Quick development of populace, reducing characteristic

    assets, environmental change, contracting rural grounds,

    and unbalanced business sectors are making the worldwide

    food frameworks rather unreliable. In this manner, current

    farming and food frameworks ought to be more gainful

    regarding yield, eﬀective in activity, tough to environmental

    change, and maintainable for the people in the future.

    Terefore, the need of an innovative change is more

    prominent than any time in recent memory. Being a new

    headway in computer sciences, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has

    the ability to address the diﬃculties of this new worldview.

    Subsequently, understanding the signiﬁcance and relevance

    of AI in farming and food area could be essential in the

    excursion towards accomplishing worldwide food security

    [1]. Te major goal of this study is to create artiﬁcial in-

    telligence and methodology for assessing and optimizing

    food quality and safety initiatives in the food sector. Te

    cost-eﬀectiveness of the approaches examined in this study is

    as follows:

    (a) Aspects of general technical and economic impor-

    tance to consider when evaluating food quality and

    safety improvements

    (b) Quantiﬁcation of the relative eﬃcacy of various AI

    techniques for increasing food quality with growth

    focus on the farm stage

    (c) Optimal (lowest cost) AI techniques for enhancing

    food quality at various stages

    (d) Te impact of farm scale on additional expenses

    associated with implementation of AI techniques to

    improve the food quality and their distribution

    throughout various stages of the supply chain

    Tis audit centers around the AI applications corre-

    sponding to four mainstays of food security (food accessi-

    bility,

    food

    availability,

    food

    use,

    and

    strength)

    characterized by FAO, in detail. Te AI innovations are

    being applied worldwide in every one of the four mainstays

    of food security despite the fact that it has been one of the

    more slow received advancements contrasted with the rest.

    On the other hand, it warrants investigating the abilities of

    AI and their present eﬀect on the food frameworks. It is

    prominent that AI innovation has a critical task to carry out

    later on the cultivation area. Te overall AI in cultivation

    market is required to arrive at USD 2,075 million by 2024.

    Present article uncovers how AI innovations could proﬁt

    worldwide farming and food area and looks at the ways by

    which AI can address the noticeable. Quality aﬃrmation is

    acquiring conspicuousness since quality ascribes are by and

    large more exceptionally esteemed by governments, buyers,

    and organizations. Some food handling ascribes incorpo-

    rated the accompanying terms described in Table 1. Tis

    higher valuation is inciting more deliberate quality aﬃr-

    mation by food organizations and more guidelines by

    government. Simultaneously, guidelines are under nearer

    investigation both locally and universally [2]. As requests for

    administrative responsibility have expanded, governments

    are progressively needed to utilize hazard appraisal and

    advantage cost investigation to assess whether existing or

    proposed food guidelines improve public government

    assistance.

    Te ﬁrst necessary dimension in order to achieve food

    security is availability, which indicates the presence of food

    in a country through all forms of domestic production,

    food stocks, imports, and food aid [4]. Te availability and

    access to food alone is not adequate, as people need to have

    a “safe and nutritious food.” Suﬃcient energy should be

    there in order to engage the daily physical activities after

    consumption of foods. Adequate sanitary facilities to avoid

    the spread of diseases, safe drinking water, and the

    awareness of food preparation and food storage are also

    included. Utilization, which is the third dimension,

    therefore, covers the diverse aspects by combining con-

    sumers’ understanding on which food to select, how to

    prepare it, and store them [5]. Food stability must be

    present at all times to exist the availability, access, and

    utilization of the food security. Tis fourth dimension

    highlights the importance to reduce the possibility of ad-

    verse eﬀects on the other three dimensions [6].

    Being a huge ﬁeld with numerous applications, AI is

    likewise perhaps the most confounded innovations to chip

    away at. Machines characteristically are not more brilliant; a

    great deal of registering force and information are needed to

    engage them to reproduce human reasoning. A bunch of

    innovative and logical advances have prompted the devel-

    opment in the utilization of AI in genuine applications in

    diﬀerent ﬁelds because of the huge increment of information

    with high computational force and huge stockpiling to

    enable them to reproduce human reasoning [7]. It is con-

    ceivable that a machine gains from its experience by

    changing their reactions dependent on new data sources

    given, playing out the human-like undertakings. Te ma-

    chines can be prepared to deal with a lot of information and

    perceive an example in them. At long last, AI is a data

    processing framework or computational framework that

    accepts information as data sources and interacts with them

    to prompt an easy to understand yield [8].

    2. Role of Artificial Intelligence Robotics in

    Food Safety

    By using the technology of artiﬁcial intelligence robotics, the

    agriculture sector would need to increase its productivity by

    about 70%. To successfully achieve this, in Figure 1(a), a

    robotic technology will need to be a core unit to secure the

    quality of food in the food industry. AI has a vital role to play

    in future food production as shown in Figure 1(b). Te

    robotics are also the part of artiﬁcial intelligence [9].

    Food and refreshment organizations are moving quick

    utilizing innovation for activities and calculated eﬃciencies

    and onto how to meet user’s requirements [10]. Te

    prominent players in the industry have embraced artiﬁcial

    intelligence to maintain strong empathy with their audience.

    Rarely, has a crisis pushed the adoption of a technology in

    the way that AI in the food business is doing right now. Te

    business of cultivating and selling high-quality food to

    consumers is being disrupted to a degree that has not been

    seen since the last pandemic, which occurred over a century

    ago. It is becoming increasingly clear that our food system

    was not adequately prepared (“antifragile”) for the COVID-

    19-induced disaster. No germs and high-quality food has

    been prepared by this artiﬁcial intelligence robotics scheme,

    as shown in Figure 1(b).

    Te continuing deconstruction and automation of the

    food supply process demonstrates that we are entering a new

    normal and that returning to the old reality would be im-

    possible. Robots, augmented reality, virtual reality, three-

    dimensional printing, sensors, machine vision, drones,

    blockchain, and the Internet of things are all altering the

    food industry, but they all have one thing in common:

    Journal of Food Quality

    artiﬁcial intelligence is the secret code or sauce underlying

    them all. As the world develops post-COVID, the applica-

    tion of AI to increase food production is quickening, and

    demands of speed, eﬃciency, and sustainability are rising in

    tandem with the quickly growing population.

    3. Applications of Artificial Intelligence with Its

    Drawbacks and Solution to These Challenges

    Artiﬁcial intelligence is transforming several sectors, in-

    cluding government, medicine, advert, and ﬁnance to name

    a few that have adopted this technology. By learning the

    intricacies involved with big data analytics and AI, the food

    and beverage industry has begun utilizing the numerous

    predictive analysis applications oﬀered by this technology. A

    fascinating certainty we found is that the worldwide AI

    market in food and drink organizations is assessed to de-

    velop yearly at an accumulate development pace of 42%

    before 2021. Tis has become evident by the increasing

    amount of food companies that are using artiﬁcial intelli-

    gence to generate more revenue and improve their pro-

    ductivity [11]. For the ﬁrst time, the light of technology has

    dawned dramatically on the food industry and has been

    implemented without any hesitation. Artiﬁcial intelligence is

    now known to be impacting many aspects of the industry

    such as ﬁnancial, production, distribution, marketing,

    consumption, packaging, and storage. To give a better ex-

    planation

    of

    the

    extensive

    usage

    of

    AI

    in

    food

    manufacturing, processing, and distribution, here are a few

    notable highlights [12].

    4. Sorting

    Sorting food requires extra attention that is paid to the

    speciﬁc details of the product, for example, size or colour.

    Tese factors help food companies to make well-guided

    decisions on the processing of various foods that will ulti-

    mately increase the purchase rate of consumers.

    Figure 2 shows the companies in the food industry, such

    as TOMRA sorting food (tomatoes), are among the few that

    take the advantage of artiﬁcial intelligence to develop ma-

    chines that signiﬁcantly improve the sorting of food [13].

    Tese technology-inclined systems are sensor based and use

    features such as cameras and near-infrared sensors to vi-

    sualize food products with human perception.

    5. Algorithm for AI-Based Robot Sorting the

    Quality of Tomato

    Step 1: capture image and capture the softness value

    Step 2: predict type of tomato using image processing

    AI technique

    Step 3: conﬁrm prediction of AI with the softness value.

    Step 4: if conﬁrmed, perform steps 5–7

    Step 5: if tomato is damaged, pick it and discard it

    Step 6: if tomato is not prepared, leave it

    Step 7: if tomato is prepared, pick it and store it

    6. Execution of Individual Cleanliness

    Propensities by Workers

    Te signiﬁcance of guaranteeing that workers in food and

    refreshment

    organizations

    take

    important

    individual

    cleanliness careful steps could not possibly be more sig-

    niﬁcant. Computerized reasoning empowers organizations

    to rapidly identify any failures in this facet and kill them for

    improved food handling. In Figure 3, several CCTV cameras

    are installed in the restaurant; this is just the advanced

    feature of the artiﬁcial intelligence. With this feature of

    artiﬁcial intelligence, the use of special cameras equipped

    with facial recognition and object recognition feature to

    ascertain if workers are committed to keeping the laws of

    food safety [14, 15].

    7. Reducing Equipment Repair and

    Maintenance Cost

    Any professional in the food industry knows how much of

    their company’s resources go into cleaning processing

    machines and also repairing them. Ongoing research

    (b)

    Figure 1: (a) A robotic workforce to secure the food quality. (b) AI role to bake
    cookie.

    Figure 2: AI-based robot sorting the quality of tomato.

    Journal of Food Quality

    3

    projects suggest that a system known as the self-optimizing-

    clear-in-place (SOCIP) which can improve cleaning time

    and drastically reduce resources used for cleaning including

    water [16]. In Figure 4, the artiﬁcial intelligence technology

    uses features such as ultrasonic sensing and optical ﬂuo-

    rescence imaging to detect the tiniest amount of food left-

    over and microbial debris present in the equipment. Tis

    aids the optimization of the cleaning/maintenance process.

    Organizations can likewise use man-made brainpower in the

    part of machine ﬁx and intermittent ideal working. It can

    rapidly identify any piece of hardware that is defective and

    separate them for instantaneous substitution of its corrupted

    apparatus. Tis will ultimately lead to improved employee

    eﬃciency and human resource management as there is a

    much better system in place to provide early detection of any

    fault [17].

    8. Optimized Supply Chain Management

    Te food industry can use artiﬁcial intelligence to minimize

    delays and maximize proﬁt margins by providing close

    monitoring of energy supply chain operation. Tis also

    helps companies to forecast for better management of

    pricing and stock products accurately. With growing

    concerns about transparency, artiﬁcial intelligence has also

    been utilized to track products from the farm to consumers

    to ensure transparency [18]. Te ﬂow of products will be

    cost-eﬀective and streamlined in the best way possible with

    the adoption of this technique into food production and

    distribution.

    9. Revolutionizing the Whole in Store Shopping

    Experience with New Products

    Based on the available demographic data and statistics

    available, many food companies have been able to provide

    location-speciﬁc varieties of food ﬂavour combinations that

    are targeted at a preferred group of consumers. By intently

    observing discussions via web-based media and utilizing

    man-made reasoning to break down burns through infor-

    mation and distinguish notions or conduct that are pivotal,

    in building positive encounters and in the turn of events and

    plan of new product oﬀerings. Tis has proven to be an

    immense contribution to the food industry because com-

    panies can now oﬀer unlimited forms of ﬂavour combos,

    spices, and ingredients [18, 19].

    10. Personalized Customer Service

    Te consumer favour a more customized insight as they

    shop utilizing visit boxes or voice aide fuelled by charac-

    teristic language handling, and organizations can tap buyer

    shopping information and history to give a hypercustomized

    and computerized client assistance experience. Using these

    predictive analysis technology provided by artiﬁcial intel-

    ligence solution providers, food companies can monitor on

    what decisions customers do overtime and what food they

    always reorder [20]. Tis ensures that the consumers are

    provided with a personalized feed containing their preferred

    food option.

    11. Better Farming Conditions

    It would be every heart-warming that the farmer could

    cultivate better food under optimal growth factors. Com-

    panies have already begun to research how they can apply

    this feature of artiﬁcial intelligence technology to better suit

    the farmers [20]. One of company known as Sentiment aims

    to invent a system that can create growing conditions where

    the eﬀects of factors such as light intensity, temperature,

    salinity, and water stress on basil can be carefully checked

    (Figure 5). As of yet, progress only being made in the lab is

    looking to come up with speciﬁc “ingredients” for making

    perfect foods. Modern applications of artiﬁcial intelligence

    in the food sector include achieving signiﬁcant reductions in

    the downtime, reducing consumer friction at the point of

    sale, speed up of manual tasks, and improving worker-

    overtime ratio to name a few [21].

    12. Challenges of Artificial Intelligence and

    Available Solution

    So, with all the diverse ways listed above on how artiﬁcial

    intelligence is improving the food industry, it might hit you

    like a ton of bricks to hear that this amazing technology has

    also got its coins. While there are many beneﬁts, there are

    just as many challenges. Companies have to decide whether

    to buy or build this technology, and ideally, food companies

    would develop their own unique in-house technology sys-

    tems. However, to be pragmatic, a lot goes into acquiring

    these systems. A portion of the diﬃculties that join utilizing

    man-made consciousness in the food business include the

    following.

    Figure 4: Application of artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Figure 3: Investigation done via AI.

    Journal of Food Quality

    12.1.Cost. Potential adapters face numerous diﬃculties with

    the price being the biggest among them and getting buy-in

    for these types of tech systems.

    12.2. Integration Issues. It is never easy to integrate new

    technologies. Tis also works similar for the integration of

    artiﬁcial intelligence in food companies.

    12.3. Proprietary Date. With the right proprietary date, food

    and beverage companies may not be talented to construct

    artiﬁcial erudition models that can execute. Given the above

    fundamental challenges, we will provide two solution ideas,

    especially for large companies with much capital that can be

    invested into adopting artiﬁcial intelligence technology.

    Food organizations that have eﬀectively settled information

    investigation and a group of expert engineers can go on to

    securely fabricate their own man-made consciousness stage.

    You do not want to jump into making this decision if your

    company’s team of developers lacks the required compe-

    tency to match up with the in-house artiﬁcial intelligence

    system. Tey should be skilled enough to keep this system

    always updated to avoid any future troubles.

    Various companies that lack such resources should ﬁnd

    food and beverage solution providers that have already

    established artiﬁcial intelligence systems which will improve

    the front-end process and back-end process in your company.

    A few examples of these solution providers are SAP and

    bundled solutions built for food and beverage distribution.

    75% of millennial in the US and UK would desire to utilize

    artiﬁcial intelligence innovation to get better help with

    arranging and preparing strong meals. Artiﬁcial intelligence is

    growing at a rapid pace and we have witnessed more com-

    panies within the food and beverage industry that are

    investing in artiﬁcial intelligence solutions for better per-

    formance. Te predictive analysis provided by this cutting-

    edge tech is being used to resolve various critical problems in

    this industry. A lot of these companies have gone a step ahead

    to combine other areas of artiﬁcial intelligence with predictive

    quality analytics to create new opportunities to develop more

    potential products for the future [20, 21].

    13. COVID-19 Pandemic and the Food

    Security in the Country

    Te recent COVID-19 pandemic has also reiterated the im-

    portance of food security particularly for developing nations. It

    has brought the global economy to a precarious position where

    Sri Lanka also has been impacted considerably at all levels.

    Almost all industries were negatively aﬀected, apart from some

    essential services, such as water, electricity, fuel, and those

    producing food (farming) and medical supplies. Continuation

    of food production as an essential service was a crucial decision

    taken by the authority in order to assure food availability and

    accessibility [22]. However, the doss distribution took a longer

    time to return to normalcy. Under new normal situation, the

    working culture has now changed to the mode of “Work from

    Home.” Hence, there is a need to redeﬁne the agriculture

    profession, and technological needs to achieve food security

    based on the new needs. In such context, we ﬁrmly believe that

    AI applications together with recent advancement in tech-

    nology have a bigger role to play. As the world develops post-

    COVID, the application of AI to increase food production is

    quickening, and demands of speed, eﬃciency, and sustain-

    ability are rising in tandem with the quickly growing pop-

    ulation. Here are six instances of food sector players that have

    implemented AI and demonstrated how it has boosted their

    growth or even revolutionized the way they operate [23].

    13.1. Processing. Food processing is a labour-intensive en-

    terprise, but one where AI can increase production and

    minimize waste by replacing employees on the line whose

    sole job is to detect products that are not appropriate for

    processing. Tis form of fast decision-making necessitates

    the use of the senses of sight and scent, as well as the capacity

    to adjust to changing conditions. AI adds even more value to

    the table with augmented vision, which analyses data

    streams that are either accessible to human senses or where

    the volume of data is overwhelming.

    13.2. Food Hygiene. AI can help to reduce the presence of

    diseases and identify poisons in food production.

    13.3. Eﬃciency in the Supply Chain. While smart devices are

    being used to replace human labour, technology is also being

    used to replace human work. Food apps, drone and robot

    deliveries, and self-driving cars are all new methods to bring

    information and food to customers, and they all rely on AI.

    13.4. Predicting Consumer Trends and Patterns Is a Diﬃcult

    Task. AI enables businesses to stay competitive in the

    market by responding to diverse popular waves of diverse

    trends and creating market predictions.

    Restaurants: following this year’s COVID-19 epidemic,

    the future of eateries is in risk. Te rise of online-based meal

    delivery services has shifted the focus away from the physical

    experience of dining establishments.

    Creating more nutritious foods: for a long time, many

    people have believed that food equals health, but now, that we

    have a better understanding of human, plant, and animal ge-

    nomes, it is becoming a reality. As the world progresses toward

    precision nutrition, changes in consumer tastes are providing

    potential for AI in food. One example is the increased desire for

    plant-based alternatives to animal protein. Creative AI

    applications have risen in response to challenges such as

    establishing consumer-acceptable ﬂavour and texture features.

    14. Synthesis and Way Forward

    Te synthesis and way forward towards the artiﬁcial intelli-

    gence plays the vital role in the examination. To achieve the

    high quality in food is the major agenda nowadays. Te

    powerful techniques have to be applied. As discussed in this

    study, achieving food security is the ultimate objective of

    future agricultural and allied sectors. A thorough review on the

    applications of AI in food security indicates promising signs in

    this regard. Within the food sector, AI could uplift existing

    practices and strategies in order to achieve productivity and

    sustainability goals eﬃciently and eﬀectively [24].

    As FAO [25] clearly states, achieving food security relies

    on top of four key pillars. Tis article primarily focused on

    the applications of AI in these four vital areas of the food

    sector. Tere are many beneﬁts of AI, which has been applied

    in the form of diﬀerent tools and techniques that are user

    friendly and providing optimum results. Tese techniques

    are combined with other technological advancements and

    being applied into agricultural practices along the food value

    chain. Many diﬀerent AI technologies have been adopted

    over a wide range of applications in the agriculture sector in

    many countries. Among those, as expected, fuzzy logic

    systems, ANN, and ML could be identiﬁed as the most

    frequently used technologies while being the pioneer con-

    cepts of this innovative branch of computer science. With

    the anticipated changes in trends in AI technology, we could

    expect diﬀerences in its complexion in applications in the

    future. As indicated in Table 1, many applications can be

    identiﬁed on the use of AI in the area of food availability.

    Tis is directly related with the objective of improving food

    production. As it provides direct beneﬁts to all the stake-

    holders, most of the AI technology developers seem to have

    concentrated their eﬀorts in this direction [26]. It would

    provide both short-term and long-term beneﬁts. However,

    achievement of future food security does not depend solely

    on ensuring food availability. One of the key ﬁndings of this

    review is the lack of AI applications in other three pillars of

    food security. Nevertheless, many recent developments in-

    dicate the use of AI applications towards other three pillars

    of food security as well. If this promising trend continues,

    there is an expectation on the achievement national level

    food security [27]. Te AI and agriculture seem two vastly

    diﬀerent sciences. However, the evidence provided in this

    article suggests that the marriage between these two ﬁelds of

    study could yield huge positive impacts in meeting the global

    goal of food security [9, 28]. Table 2 presents the four pillars

    of

    the

    food

    security

    based

    on

    artiﬁcial

    intelligence

    applications.

    From Table 2, showing the most appropriate researchers

    ideas about the plant tracking system is being developed

    using a particular AI methodology. To construct a plant

    surveillance system for sensing and managing a plant de-

    velopment parameter, namely, relative humidity, a speciﬁc

    AI approach is being used. Te system’s performance is

    extremely predictable and accurate, according to the data

    collected. Plant humidity sensors are used to monitor

    changes in moisture and to adjust irrigation methods. Tese

    simple adjustments in irrigation procedures increase pro-

    ductivity while saving water. Eﬀective irrigation manage-

    ment with plant water sensors requires focused monitoring

    of the sensors to get the water level when the data received is

    within the set range for the speciﬁc growing conditions. We

    can utilize neural networks to anticipate seasonal ﬂuctua-

    tions and rainfall in a region, which will aid farmers in

    planning their future yield.

    Asymmetric sensor node deployment, gathering of in-

    suﬃciently useable information and data for food deserts,

    and a gap between the right dataset (of which blocks are true

    food deserts) [42] and surveyed data based on limited/in-

    accurate real-world data making decisions without AI is a

    diﬃcult task.

    Te use of computer vision and deep learning technology

    in agriculture seeks to improve the quality of harvests and

    farmers’ production. Assorting fruits and vegetables has an

    impact on the export market and quality evaluation at

    postharvest. TOMRA industry sorts the good quality to-

    matoes from defected tomatoes during harvesting or/and

    during the postharvesting phase, as shown in Figure 2. Te

    goal of this article is to assist farmers with postharvest

    processing by determining whether modern AI approaches

    may assist in distinguishing healthy tomatoes from tomatoes

    with ﬂaws [57–60].

    15. Conclusion

    Te artiﬁcial intelligence approach provides eﬃcient solu-

    tion that helps to increase the lifetime of farming activities.

    Terefore, in farming, the concept of artiﬁcial intelligence is

    implemented which makes the task so eﬀective and simple.

    One beneﬁt of these computerized frameworks is that they

    oﬀer consistent data across a scope of timescales, from hours

    to months, accordingly working with the advancement of

    models of cycles which might be explicit to a speciﬁc time

    span. Besides, these frameworks can promptly be utilized in

    business nurseries, so the inferred intelligent models are

    moderately simple to convey to a business setting where they

    can consequently be improved over the long moment.

    Share Cite Abstract This paper describes the design, realization, and application
    of a custom temperature sensor devoted to the monitoring of the temperature differential
    between the leaf and the air. This difference is strictly related to the plant
    water stress and can be used as an input information for an intelligent and flexible
    irrigation system. A wireless temperature sensor network can be thought as a decision
    support system used to start irrigation when effectively needed by the cultivation,
    thus saving water, pump fuel oil, and preventing plant illness caused by over-watering.

    the process of irrigation of crops using a phytoindication system based on computer
    vision methods. We have proposed an algorithm and developed a system for obtaining
    a map of irrigation for maize in low latency mode. The system can be installed
    on a center pivot irrigation and consists of 8 IP cameras connected to a DVR connected
    to a laptop. The algorithm consists of three stages. Image preprocessing stage
    - applying an integrated excess green and excess red difference (ExGR) index.
    The classification stage is the application of the method that we choose depending
    on the system’s operating conditions. At the final stage, a neural network trained
    using the Resilient Propagation method is used, which determines the rate of watering
    of plants in the current sector of the location of the sprinkler. The selected
    methods of pretreatment and classification made it possible to achieve an accuracy
    of plant identification up to 93%, growth stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated
    maize sowing and good lighting). System performance up to 100 plants in one second,
    which exceeds the performance of similar systems. The neural network showed an
    accuracy of 92% on the training set and 87% on the test set. Dynamic analysis
    of spatial and temporal variability leads to an increase in productivity and efficiency
    of water use. In addition, given the ubiquitous distribution of agribusiness management
    systems, this approach is quite simple to implement in the farm’s conditions.

    statistics, agricultural production on a global scale over the past half-century
    has grown 2.5-3 times, and the growth of acreage was about 12%. In addition, according
    to UNESCO data, agriculture is undoubtedly the largest consumer of water, while
    70% of the total freshwater intake is used for irrigation [1]. In water-stressed
    regions, irrigation is of fundamental importance, as irrigated agriculture accounts
    for 16% of the world’s cultivated area, which produces 30% to 40% of the world’s
    food [2]. At the same time, the area of irrigated land has more than doubled over
    fifty years and comprises on average more than 16% of all agricultural land, and
    the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation has almost doubled. FAO’s projected
    1-2% annual growth in global irrigated areas, as well as trends in climate change
    (temperature and precipitation), in the next 20 years could lead to a significant
    increase in water consumption (according to FAO estimates by 14%) and energy,
    which in turn puts forward the problem of saving water, energy and material and
    technical resources, protecting the natural environment [2]. Traditional methods
    of planning irrigation based on visual inspection lead to significant water losses
    and raise the issue of optimizing irrigation. All of this has contributed to the
    emergence of various methods of controlled irrigation such as sprinkler, drip,
    and furrow irrigation. The introduction of these methods allows to reduce water
    losses by 30–70% and contributes to the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture
    [3]. Further development of optimization methods led to the emergence of the so-called
    precision irrigation, which allows you to estimate the amount of water, irrigation
    time, and maintains the exact water content in the soil, depending on the needs
    of the growth and development of crops. In this regard, technologies of precision
    farming have become widespread, which involve considering spatial and temporal
    variability and differentiating the use of resources [4], [5]. In this regard,
    a key problem of irrigation management arises - its optimization both from the
    point of view of irrigation technique and from the point of view of technology.
    Classical water resources management is based on the use of uniformly introduced
    resources across the field, considered as a single spatial unit and if the actual
    operating parameters of the sprinkler equipment coincide with the theoretical
    ones. However, on the one hand, sprinkler technology is a complex dynamic system,
    the operation of which is influenced by many stochastic factors. On the other
    hand, the object of the impact of technology - the field is a complex biological
    system with Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the characteristics of soil, climate,
    plants, and, therefore, uneven need for irrigation [6], [7]. The operation of
    irrigation equipment plays an important role in irrigated agriculture. Optimizing
    irrigation equipment is an important strategy for conserving resources, increasing
    productivity, and improving production efficiency. Among the various systems,
    one can distinguish Center Pivot Irrigation Systems, which account for up to 23%
    of the total area irrigated by sprinkler irrigation systems [8]. And in Russia,
    for example, about 22% of the total irrigated area is irrigated with such systems.
    A. Precision Agriculture, Digitalization, and Artificial Intelligence In connection
    with the role played by Center Pivot Irrigation systems (CPI), numerous studies
    are being carried out to improve the technical parameters of these systems: improving
    the uniformity of irrigation, modeling sprinklers, and lateral corner joints [9]–[11].
    In addition, the Precision Agriculture methodology appears for such systems as
    well. Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) considers Spatio-temporal variability by
    delivering a variable amount of water to a specific area following crop water
    requirements. At the same time, for sprinkler systems of circular action, VRI
    assumes either irrigation at a controlled speed (assumes a change in the irrigation
    rate in the direction of a moving sprinkler by changing the speed of its movement)
    or irrigation with a controlled zone (involves a change in the irrigation rate
    both along the side pipeline and in the direction of movement sprinkler) [12].
    Many scientists have been involved in the development and improvement of VRI methods
    [12]–[14] since the creation of optimal VRI solutions is rather difficult and
    must consider a large number of factors. Some scientists considered the properties
    of water in the soil as a basis for monitoring, others - the state of plants.
    Thus, in the study [12], automatic control of the speed of movement is based on
    technologies for monitoring the electrical conductivity of the soil and altimetry,
    the moisture content in the soil, and vegetation indices obtained from satellite
    images. In [13], the interaction between spatially changing soil properties and
    the time-varying dynamics of water in crops is investigated. It is shown that
    modeling soil moisture depletion can be an effective planning tool in VRI. A decision
    support system for variable rate irrigation is presented in a study [14]. The
    system is based on the vegetation index (VI), obtained after processing multispectral
    images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles. And the evapotranspiration model
    and the crop water stress index are derived from their established relationships
    with the vegetation index. Work [15] summarizes the advantages and disadvantages
    of the variable rate irrigation methodology. Until now, these methods need further
    development and improvement as further studies of space-time variability are needed
    to make these improvements. Digitalization is becoming one of such powerful tools
    for increasing the efficiency of both irrigation and agriculture in general. The
    current stage of development of precision farming and digital agriculture makes
    it possible to widely use such tools based on artificial intelligence, and the
    Internet of Things (IoT) is the basis for intelligent agriculture. Thus, [16]
    provides an overview of best practices in the implementation of sensor irrigation
    systems, along with the most used nodes and wireless technologies. In such systems,
    wireless sensor networks and all kinds of sensors (soil moisture, soil temperature,
    ambient temperature, etc.) are actively used. Optimization of irrigation is achieved
    in various ways, in [17] - by precise control of the water valve using neural
    network forecasting of soil water demand, and in [18], for example, by integrating
    an automated irrigation system with an irrigation decision support tool. In addition,
    all sorts of applications are created for data analysis and decision support at
    all stages of the agricultural cycle. SWAMP platform [19] for intelligent water
    management based on the Internet of Things for precision irrigation. The system
    for optimal irrigation of crops [20] is based on a wireless sensor network using
    nodal sensors in the field and data management via a smartphone and a web application.
    [21] presents a study on the integration between various tools to improve water
    efficiency in agriculture (field sensors and remote sensing). The systems considered
    in [22], [23] involve data monitoring, their preliminary processing, integration,
    synchronization, and storage with subsequent use for intelligent irrigation. Thus,
    the digitalization of agriculture makes it possible to make the transition from
    classical control systems to systems with artificial intelligence. In recent years,
    many researchers in the development of the Precision Agriculture methodology in
    general and for irrigation management use such a tool as artificial neural networks.
    The range of applications of artificial neural networks in agriculture is very
    wide. Researchers are using these tools to model agricultural production, replacing
    classical mathematical models. They can be both part of precision farming systems
    and decision support. An overview of the application is presented in [24], [25]
    and includes forecasting in agriculture, intelligent monitoring of diseases and
    pests, and weed control. Artificial intelligence methods are also used to optimize
    storage and transportation processes. In addition, AI methods contribute to the
    improvement of the automation of various processes. The introduction of artificial
    intelligence in agriculture is associated with the problems of the systematic
    collection of data from multiple sources of storage and analysis. Approaches to
    solving these problems are outlined in [26], [27] and represent pilot projects
    for the analysis of advanced control systems in various natural and climatic conditions.
    One of the key artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning, has
    significant potential for solving numerous problems. The work [28] provides an
    overview of the use of machine learning in agriculture, namely, the management
    of water resources, soil, and animal husbandry. Big data and machine learning
    (ML) open new possibilities for understanding agricultural processes using data,
    along with this, there are numerous problems of integrating these technologies
    that require research and solution [29]. Machine learning is an important decision
    support tool, for example in [30] it has found application in yield forecasting,
    including making decisions about crop types and cultivation technologies during
    the growing season. Artificial intelligence methods are gaining importance in
    agricultural robotics. A study of the similarities and differences between industrial
    and field robots is presented in [31], along with a suggestion of potential methods
    for use on farms. B. Artificial Intelligence in Irrigated Agriculture In recent
    years, data-driven models have begun to play a key role in comparison with classical
    physical models. Methods of artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), artificial
    neural networks show good predictive characteristics, more quickly and efficiently
    process large arrays of Spatio-temporal data. This is especially important for
    irrigation management due to the large Spatio-temporal variability of external
    conditions and, often, the need for continuous calibration in real-time. These
    methods have numerous applications for irrigation and water management. Some systems
    [32] are based on an intelligent algorithm that considers the received sensor
    data together with the parameters of the weather forecast (precipitation, air
    temperature, humidity, and UV radiation) for the near future. In others [17],
    [33], irrigation is optimized by precise control of the water valve, current sensors
    using neural networks forecasting soil water demand, or fuzzy inferences [34]
    by creating prescriptive maps to control the rotation speed of the central axis
    based on remote sensing. The combination of big data and machine learning technologies
    with remote sensing technologies leads to the creation of new methods and algorithms
    presented in [35]. And [36] presents the development of a combined intelligent
    agricultural machine that can automatically weed and irrigate at a variable rate
    on a cultivated field. Some approaches to the intellectualization of CPI control
    systems are considered in [37]. One of the directions is the creation of intelligent
    decision support systems. In [38], a comparative study of various algorithms and
    training methods (ANN, linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR)
    and auxiliary vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and adaptive
    gain (AdaBoost) algorithms were carried out to determine the admissibility of
    the erroneousness of the experts’ decisions. Such systems are also developed at
    the level of management of irrigation systems. The AWARD system [39] uses artificial
    neural network techniques to predict water level, a fuzzy logic control algorithm
    to estimate the sluice adjustment period, and hydraulic equations to adjust the
    sluice level. An example is DLiSA’s intelligent irrigation system based on a deep
    learning neural network for predicting the volumetric moisture content in the
    soil, the period of irrigation, and the spatial distribution of water, considering
    the need for it [40]. In addition, models of artificial neural networks and machine
    learning are used to calculate important irrigation parameters, such as soil moisture
    [41], soil salinity [42], horizontal daily global solar irradiation predictive
    modeling [43], modeling the water-soil regime and transport of dissolved substances
    [44]. And, artificial neural networks, machine learning to use to develop strategies
    for irrigation management with given economic parameters to reduce water and energy
    consumption without compromising crop yields [45]–[47]. Yang et al. [48] proposed
    an integrated CNN model based on hyperspectral and RGB images taken at 5 stages
    of corn growth. Pang et al. [49] based on drone images using the combined convolutional
    neural network MaxArea Mask Scoring RCNN, areas of poor germination of corn were
    identified. The authors noted the high processing speed, however, does not allow
    the use of this system for real-time applications. Zhong et al. [50] recorded
    different stages of plant growth using a method based on a combination of time
    series with convolutional neural networks. Kuznetsova et al. [51], [52] use high-speed
    computer vision techniques YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 on a robotic crop picker. Despite
    a large amount of research, there are still many open problems in the field of
    optimal irrigation management using CPI systems. The variable rate irrigation
    approach has undoubtedly proven to be effective. However, an analysis of the current
    state of research on VRI optimization by CPI systems allows us to identify the
    main problem points: The complexity of collecting the required data set, the lack
    of time series data on the state of a particular field, and crop yields in this
    field, considering the temporal climatic variability. Difficulty in choosing appropriate
    data analysis methods to find a compromise between the two paradigms for monitoring
    spatial variability - water properties in soil and plant health. Difficulty in
    applying more accurate methods of intellectual analysis in dynamics during the
    entire agricultural season. Difficulty in the technical implementation of the
    proposed solutions, for example, expensive sensors, sensors, and other equipment.
    With current advances in proximal and non-invasive sensing technologies, IOTs
    can provide a wealth of information about soil, crops, and related environmental
    properties, and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze all this data are
    contributing to new approaches to improve the situation. The use of computer vision
    systems for condition monitoring seems to be quite interesting due to the relatively
    inexpensive implementation and the possibility of using more accurate methods
    of intellectual analysis. Optimal variable rate irrigation management requires
    a combination of both computer vision systems and additional climate and remote
    sensing data to detect Spatio-temporal dynamic variability in crop water requirements.
    The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for optimizing irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions. It is based on the implementation
    of regular monitoring of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication,
    as well as forecasting the dynamic variability of the state of water availability
    to improve irrigation. The proposed solutions offer a combination of neural network
    approaches, from the use of multilayer artificial neural networks to pattern recognition
    and convolution neural networks. The algorithm of the proposed approach is as
    follows: At the first step, the Phyto monitoring of the state of the agricultural
    crop and the environment is carried out based on computer vision using convolution
    neural networks. At the second step, a dynamic variable forecast is constructed
    based on the time series of data of average daily air temperature (T), amount
    of precipitation (R), Air humidity (AH), Wind speed (WS), and Normalized Difference
    Water Index (NDWI) -ability of water availability based on multilayer artificial
    neural networks. As a result, we obtain dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions
    based on the classification procedure of the results of the first two neural networks.
    SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Materials The study was conducted in the
    Saratov region of the Russian Federation. Russia has significant soil and water
    resources, but the largest part of its land used for agricultural production is
    in areas of risky agriculture with insufficient or excessive modes of natural
    moisture. Only 2% of the land in the Russian Federation is in optimal moisture
    conditions. The main share of agricultural products (in value terms) is produced
    in the arid zone, where more than 78% of arable land is concentrated. The land
    reclamation fund of the Russian Federation amounted to an area of 9.45 million
    hectares of which 75% was used, including 4.67 million hectares of irrigated land,
    of which 82% was used and 4.78 million hectares of drained land, of which 68%
    were used [46]. The Volga region is one of the largest regions of Russia, where
    land reclamation is developed. The Saratov Region occupies about 10% of the total
    area of the Volga Federal District. The Volga Federal District is in third place
    among the federal districts in terms of reclaimed lands and the leader in terms
    of the percentage of irrigated lands in good condition. Among all regions, the
    Saratov region ranks first in the district in terms of the area of reclaimed land
    - 19%. The main climatic parameters of the irrigated zone of the Saratov region
    are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 The Main Climatic Parameters of the Study Area
    The sums of air humidity deficits in the warm season increase from north to south
    from 1800 to 2200 millibars. On the contrary, the sums of active temperatures
    decrease in the same direction from 3500 to 3000 °C. The zonal soils of the left-bank
    regions (the main irrigation zone) of the Saratov region are classified as southern
    chernozems, chestnut of various subtypes (dark-chestnut, light-chestnut, and chestnut
    proper), as well as brown semi-desert in the extreme southeast of the left bank.
    In terms of the content of organic matter, the soils of the Left Bank are rather
    poor: it varies within 3.0 … 5.0% in southern chernozems, 2.5 … 4.0% in dark chestnut
    soils; 1.5 … 3.0% for light chestnut and chestnut. In the natural and climatic
    zone of the Saratov region, there is significant spatial variability of natural
    conditions, primarily soil, geomorphological, hydrogeological. Analysis of the
    data of the geoinformation system for monitoring irrigated lands showed that within
    the framework of the site of one farm, they can be located on 133 contours of
    29 soil differences. Moreover, individual irrigated fields were located on several
    soil differences - from 2 to 5. The quantitative and qualitative composition of
    irrigation techniques plays an important role both in the condition of irrigated
    lands and in increasing the efficiency of agricultural production on irrigated
    lands. In Russia about 22% of CPI systems are used; in the melioration complex
    of the Saratov region, these systems are the main ones. To collect data, experimental
    studies were carried out in the Engelsky district of the Saratov region of Russia
    (experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State Agrarian University). The
    irrigated area is equipped with the Center Pivot Irrigation (CPI) system ≪ Cascade
    ≫ . It is equipped with GPS trackers, cameras and real-time data is displayed
    in the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ digital platform for agribusiness management (Figure 1).
    In addition, the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system allows collecting data on weather, soil
    condition, and basic agrotechnical information about crops, equipment operation
    based on weather station sensors, remote sensing, etc. In this study, the following
    data were used: Climatic data - wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative
    air humidity, temperature and humidity of foliage and soil, atmospheric pressure,
    amount of precipitation. Indices - Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). CPI
    information - speed. FIGURE 1. The ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system window. Show All An example
    of a date-set of climatic data for a month (June 2020) is given in Table 2. The
    Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) provides information on both the spatial
    distribution of water stress on vegetation and its temporal development. The example
    of an image of the NDWI index for the experimental site is shown in Figure 2.
    TABLE 2 Data-set: Climatic Data FIGURE 2. NDWI index snapshot. Show All The second
    component of our system is based on biological methods for diagnosing anthropogenic
    changes - this is both the state of the agricultural crop itself and the state
    of the environment. The active use of these methods is associated with the quick
    reaction of organisms to any deviations in the environment from the norm. In our
    study, these are the parameters of the soil condition in the irrigated area. Control
    is necessary for almost all-important parameters of the state of the soil. These
    include the provision of soil with moisture, mechanical composition, type of oxidation-reduction
    regime, etc. We use an approach based on determining the qualitative properties
    of the soil using indicator plants. It is based [53] considering the species diversity
    of macrophytes and their indicator significance. Phytoindicators are called plants,
    plant communities, or their features that indicate some specific properties of
    the environment. Phytoindication is one of the practical uses of various traits
    and properties of individual plants or plant communities and their complexes to
    obtain qualitative and sometimes quantitative characteristics of the environment.
    With the help of plants, it is possible to identify individual characteristics
    of soils: their texture, moisture, acidity, salinity, nutrient supply. Figure
    3 shows plant bioindicators used in our study. FIGURE 3. Plants—bioindicators
    and the main crop: 1) Cirsium arvense, 2) chamomile, 3) wormwood, 4) main crop—corn.
    Show All B. Calculation of the Vegetation Index For better localization of plants
    in the image, we use the vegetation index. This increases the contrast between
    vegetation and soil. Three bands of the spectrum are used as color sources: red
    (R), green (G), and blue (B). Since the encoding of each band is carried out in
    the range from 0 to 255, we normalize the image using (1): r= b= R R+G+B ;g= G
    R+G+B ; B R+G+B ;r+g+b=1 (1) View Source Considering the peculiarities of the
    object of study of video filming, we are interested in the index of excess green
    (ExG) (1) and excess red (ExR) (2). Based on these indices, the ExGR index (3)
    is created. ExG= ExR= ExGR= 2g−r−b 1.4r−b ExG−ExR (2) (3) (4) View Source The
    ExGR index results (Figure 4) in an image in which pixels range from positive
    (plant) to negative (soil and residues) values. This allows segmentation without
    the need for additional processing tools such as Otsu, Niblack, etc. FIGURE 4.
    Images of corn plants at different stages of growth: 1), 3), and 5) color image
    and 2), 4), and 6) image binarized using the ExGR index. Show All C. Using a Descriptor
    The HOG method assumes that the type of distribution of image intensity gradients
    makes it possible to accurately determine the presence and shape of objects present
    on it. The image is split into cells. Histograms hi of the directed gradients
    of the interior points are calculated in the cells. They are combined into one
    bar chart h = f ( h 1 ,…, h k ), after which it is normalized in brightness. The
    normalization factor can be obtained in several ways, but they show approximately
    the same results. We will use the following: h L = h ∥h∥ 2 2 + ε 2 − − − − − −
    − − √ (5) View Source where ∥h∥ 2 – used norm, ε – some small constant. When calculating
    the gradients, the image is convolved with the kernels [−1, 0, 1] and [−1, 0,
    1]T, as a result of which two matrices Dx and Dy of derivatives along the x and
    y axes are formed, respectively. These matrices are used to calculate the angles
    and magnitudes of the gradients at each point in the image. Figure 5 (2, 4, 6)
    shows the result of applying the HOG method to an image processed using vegetation
    index 5 (1, 3, 5). For clarity, only the magnitude of the gradient is shown (the
    brighter the pixel, the larger the gradient). FIGURE 5. Images of corn plants
    at different stages of growth: 1), 3), and 5) in grayscale, obtained using the
    ExGR index and 2), 4), and 6) obtained by the HOG method. Show All The scale-invariant
    feature transform (SIFT) descriptor is used to extract feature points from the
    image, which are later used in classifiers. The key point in finding them is building
    a pyramid of Gaussians and the difference of Gaussians. Gaussian - image blurred
    with a Gaussian filter: L(x,y,σ)=G(x,y,σ)∗I(x,y), (6) View Source with coordinates
    (x,y) and blur radius σ ; G(x,y,σ) – Gaussian kernel; I(x,y) – the value of the
    original image; ∗ - convolution operation. The difference of Gaussians is an image
    obtained by pixel-by-pixel subtraction of the Gaussian of the original image from
    a Gaussian with a different blur radius ( kσ ): D(x,y,σ)=L(x,y,kσ)−L(x,y,σ) (7)
    View Source A pyramid of Gaussians and Gaussian differences is constructed. When
    moving from one level of the pyramid to another, the dimensions of the images
    are halved. After building the pyramids, the singular points are determined, which
    are the local extrema of the difference of the Gaussians. False key points are
    discarded, and for the remaining ones, their orientation is calculated. The magnitude
    of the gradient m and the direction of the gradient θ is determined from the (8)-(9):
    m(x,y)= θ(x,y)= ( (L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y)) 2 + (L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1)) 2 ) 1/2 tan −1 (
    L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1) L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y) ) (8) (9) View Source In the SIFT method,
    the descriptor is a vector. Take a 4×4 square area centered at the singular point,
    rotate following the direction of the singular point. Each element of the area
    indicates the magnitude of the gradient in eight directions. D. Image Classification
    Using BOVW BOVW is used to improve the performance of descriptors. This approach
    considers the blocks as key parts of the plant, and each block’s HOG represents
    the local information of the corresponding part. Next, we cluster the HOG of all
    the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using K-means, and the
    centers will be the mean value of the blocks’ HOG within the cluster. (We then
    group the HOGs of all the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using
    K-means, and the centers will be the average of the HOGs of the blocks in the
    cluster.) These centers will play the role of Visual-Words in BOVW (Figure 6).
    FIGURE 6. Steps to create a Visual-Words. Show All SECTION III. Experiments and
    Results A. Installation 8 IP cameras were installed on the irrigation system,
    connected to an 8-channel video recorder, constantly filming plants. For more
    efficient video recording, the cameras were not evenly fixed to the irrigation
    system. The first camera was installed at a remote point of the irrigation system.
    The removal of the rest was determined by (10): r i =K∗ (2i−1)/2 − − − − − − −
    − √ (10) View Source where i is the ordinal number of the chamber, starting from
    the axis of rotation of the irrigation system, ri is the distance to it. The K
    coefficient is obtained by substituting the number of chambers involved and the
    distance from the axis of rotation to the most distant point of the irrigation
    system into this formula. In our case, with a radius of the irrigation system
    equal to 370 meters, the coefficient is 95.5 meters. We used camcorders with a
    fixed focal length of 3.6 mm, matrix size 1/2.8, which allowed us to take pictures
    with a viewing angle of up to 96 degrees. The protection class of the camera is
    ip67. The protection class was fundamentally important because the cells were
    constantly exposed to streams of water. The large viewing angle of the video camera
    allows you to track the same plant from different angles while moving it. This
    allows you to collect much more information on each object under study, and therefore
    more accurately determine its state and phase of development. We abandoned cameras
    with a viewing angle greater than 100 degrees because we must perform additional
    preprocessing methods to correct aberrations that significantly distort the image.
    In addition, the greater the angle at which the plant is located to the vertical,
    the more overlap of parts of nearby growing plants on it, and this leads to serious
    errors in classification. Considering the height of the cameras above the ground
    (in our case, 1 meter, we came to the optimal sliding window with a size of 1
    * 1 m. Now about the shooting speed. The IP cameras used operate at a frequency
    of 30 Fpx. There is no point in processing all these frames. This would make our
    computer vision system extremely slow. The number of processed frames per second
    depends on the speed of movement of the irrigation unit and is determined from
    the following considerations: each plant that falls into the sliding window must
    be processed at least 2 times. For a linear speed of 0.5 m / s, the point farthest
    from the bore axis, from the outermost video camera, 1 image should be processed
    in 1 second. If you take images from all 8 cameras (the closer the camera is to
    the axis of rotation, the fewer shots you need to take per second), you need to
    process no more than 5 shots per second. If the number of weeds is not significant
    and the rotation speed of the extreme point does not exceed 1 m/s, the computer
    vision system works in real-time. When setting up the video system, special attention
    had to be paid to protecting the camera lenses from water droplets and fogging.
    If we use a cone-shaped casing from direct moisture penetration. B. Image Processing
    Techniques Initially, the vegetation index was calculated from the photograph,
    which was used to obtain a grayscale and binary image. For further image processing,
    we tested three high-performance methods: SIFT-SVM, HOG-BOVW-BPNN, and binarization
    by the ExGR - CNN index. For comparison, the outdated HOG-CNN method was tested
    along with them. The first two methods were applied to grayscale images, and the
    third to a binary image. All algorithms used in the work are implemented using
    the OpenCV Python library. The classification was made according to the following
    criteria: corn Figure 4, weed from the list of indicators Figure 3, weed. When
    corn is identified, the stage of growth is determined. To train the methods, a
    dataset was used, of 1500 corn plants at different stages of development. The
    dataset was marked by agricultural scientists working on the farm. In addition,
    a dataset with indicator plants was used (from 500 to 800 for each variety). The
    results of the methods are shown in Tables 3 and 4. TABLE 3 Results of the Work
    of Methods for the Determination of Indicator Plants and Corn Plants TABLE 4 The
    Results of Methods for Determining the Stage of Growth of Corn It can be seen
    from the results obtained that the classical HOG - CNN method is significantly
    inferior to any of the three selected. SIFT-SVM is not inferior to the other two
    in terms of processing speed, but the results of its work are slightly worse than
    the other two. We were unable to choose the best among the two remaining methods.
    Even though in the CNN method we used 3 x 3 convolutional kernels (this greatly
    accelerated it), the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is 20% faster, but its classification
    results are slightly lower in sunny conditions. In cloudy weather, the results
    are reduced for both methods, but the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is more stable in reducing
    the illumination level [54]. We assume that it makes sense to use both methods
    depending on the conditions. The results of these methods (tables 3 and 4) significantly
    exceed the results presented in works on computer vision in recent years [48]–[50].
    This is merit not only of modern methods of computer vision but also of successful
    shooting conditions. The sprinkler removes dust from plant leaves and the ExGR
    imaging method works most efficiently. C. Dynamic Maps of Irrigation Prescriptions
    A schematic representation of the key algorithm is shown in Table 5: TABLE 5 Algorithm
    In the previous works of the authors, a program [55] was developed for determining
    the optimal parameters of humidification in the calculated soil layer for the
    main crops, including corn, for a given region. This system also considers the
    phases of growth and development of the crop, the type, and the granulometric
    composition of the soil. Climate data is one of the main parameters, both in classical
    models such as AQUACROP and in models using artificial neural networks to predict
    crop water demand and water availability. In the developed system, a multilayer
    neural network model with input, hidden, and output layers were used. For training,
    the Resilient Propagation method was used, which has proven itself well in this
    kind of problem. Our work considers several criteria when creating an irrigation
    map. In addition to the standard ones, such as humidity, temperature, etc. we
    consider the current state of the crop itself relative to the planned one and
    the presence of indicator plants. The neural network we use (Figure 7) was trained
    using a sample labeled by agronomists based on many years of research on the dependence
    of the state of the crop on the moisture deficit for a given climatic zone. For
    each specific case from the sample, they compared the irrigation correction factor.
    The HOG descriptor in the monitoring system was not chosen by chance in our work.
    One of the main advantages over other descriptors is that it is very resistant
    to lighting changes. Its performance changes slightly in the conditions in which
    shooting is usually done. FIGURE 7. The process of obtaining a map of irrigation
    of crops for corn: a) map of deviation of the real development of corn plants
    from the norm; b) a map of the location of indicator plants; c) current NDWI;
    d) water availability variability map; e) maps of irrigation of crops for corn.
    Show All Based on the results obtained using the HOG - BOVW - BPNN method and
    binarization according to the ExGR - CNN index, the growth stages of plants caught
    in the camera lens are determined. These data are compared with the planned indicators
    for the given area. Figure 7 (a) presents the results of the deviation in development
    from the planned indicators for 10–15 days of growth (6 plant’s leaf). Figure
    7 (a) shows the center of the reference scale. Each new division differs from
    the previous one by 1 day of vegetation. The scale is not limited to five values
    and extends both in one direction and in the other direction. The yellow area
    is normal, the red area indicates a lag in plant development from the norm, and
    the green areas are ahead. Our model also considers the distribution of indicator
    plants over figure 7(b). The yellow area corresponds to an area with an undetected
    predominance of plants that prefer moist soils and dry-loving ones. In terms of
    numbers, this is either a complete absence of both types of plants or, the overweight
    of one of the types is no more than two times. This corresponds to a value of
    3 on the scale figure 7(b). Other values are determined according to the principle:
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 2 to 4 times;
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 4 to 8 times;
    etc. Similarly, zones with a predominance of dry-loving plants are determined.
    Another element that we will consider when planning the irrigation of the field
    is NDWI figure 7(c). We receive the current value of this indicator once every
    10 days. To establish the correct irrigation regime, we created a neural network
    that, using previous NDWI results and weather reports, predicts the dynamic variability
    of water availability for some time ahead. All parameters supplied to the neural
    network are presented in numerical values: NDWI color gradations are set according
    to the standard. They are converted into numerical values in the range from 0
    to 1, where 0 is white (lack of moisture in the soil), 1 is dark blue (wetland).
    Intermediate values are calculated according to the shades of blue. Cloudiness
    is determined by discrete values from its absence - 0, to complete obscurity of
    the sun’s clouds - 3. Air humidity - relative humidity ranging from 0 to 100%
    Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. Wind speed is measured in meters per
    second. When training the neural network, we used NDWI data in size (100 images),
    data from weather stations for the period of the NDWI study. The neural network
    was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [56]. At the final stage of
    obtaining a map of watering corn, data from steps 1 and 2 are passed through the
    second neural network, which determines the lack of moisture in the soil. This
    neural network was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [55] Based on
    the dataset obtained in the experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State
    Agrarian University in 2020 and previously marked by agronomical scientists. The
    result of the network is a map of the field, divided into sections, indicating
    the amount of water required to irrigate 1 square meter of this section of the
    field. Considering the peculiarities of the sprinkler system, the whole field
    was divided into sectors figure 7(e). The parameters of each sector were determined
    based on the parameters of the sections of which it consists of. On this map,
    the yellow area is the base area. It determines the average amount of moisture
    required for a given field. The red area means that this sector requires more
    moisture than average, the green area requires less moisture relative to the norm.
    The distribution of percentages of the total area under the influence of the prescription
    in each irrigation plan with a dynamic prescription for 6 irrigation actions is
    shown in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. Distribution of percentages of the total area under
    the influence of the dynamic prescription. Show All Computer vision’s-based monitoring
    allows for a dynamic assessment of the actual state of culture and depending on
    the stage of development. Along with the forecast of water availability, this
    makes it possible to overestimate the irrigation rate. So, for example, for irrigation
    actions 5-6, which corresponded to August-September, zones were identified where
    the culture reached late stages of growth and, as a result, a decrease in the
    amount of irrigation is possible, in contrast to standard prescriptions, as can
    be seen in Figure 8. We carried out a comparative analysis of water consumption
    when implementing a standard irrigation strategy and a variable irrigation strategy
    based on dynamic prescription maps. Let us introduce the notation: P i − standard
    irrigation rate corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. S – the area of irrigation
    plot, S j – part of the area of the irrigation plot under the influence of the
    prescription j. S= ∑ 5 j=1 S j (11) View Source Then the irrigation amount with
    standard irrigation, corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. IA i st =S P
    i (12) View Source Irrigation amount with dynamic prescription, corresponding
    to the i-th irrigation action. IA i D = ∑ 5 j=1 S j ( k i j P i ), (13) View Source
    where k i j – irrigation correction factor for S j , corresponding to the i-th
    irrigation action, k i j ={0,8;0,9;1;1,1;1,2} . Irrigation correction factor k
    i j is a numerical expression of the dynamic prescription map obtained as a result
    of the third step of the algorithm. Further development of the method involves
    an increase in the set of k i j values, which will lead to an improvement in the
    efficiency of irrigation water use and productivity. The decrease in the amount
    of irrigation water (in%) because of the implementation of a variable irrigation
    strategy instead of the standard one can be calculated because of maps of dynamic
    prescriptions, the number of irrigation measures, and the established correction
    factors based on (11)-(13). The data of experimental studies of the volume of
    irrigation with standard irrigation and the volume of irrigation with dynamic
    irrigation for the purpose show an increase in this indicator in each irrigation
    action from 0.3% to 1.8%, which gives an increase in total for all irrigations
    of 7.4%. At the same time, the efficiency of the use of irrigation water, which
    links the yield of crops per unit of water used, increases due to an increase
    in yield by 8.9%. SECTION IV. Discussion The irrigation technique plays an important
    role both in the condition of irrigated land and in improving the efficiency of
    agricultural production on irrigated land. In Russia, as well as on a global scale,
    about 22 -23% of CPI systems are used. One method for irrigation management is
    VRI, but the high implementation and management costs limit its application. On
    the one hand, the recently appeared agribusiness management systems such as “Agrosignal”
    allow collecting huge amounts of data, and on the other hand, even the simplest
    analogs of CPI systems have control panels with speed control modules, which makes
    it possible to implement inexpensive irrigation control systems … For this, it
    is necessary to develop maps of irrigation prescriptions that consider the spatial-temporal
    variability of the irrigation site. The purpose of this study was to develop neural
    network methods for determining dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control using 1) phytoindication based on computer vision of the states
    of crops; 2) phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of the soil
    by plants - indicators; 3) intellectual analysis of data from monitoring systems
    of environmental conditions, the water indices, as well as the knowledge base
    of the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. The question of
    defining irrigation zones is fundamental in this kind of research [13], [14].
    From a formal point of view, the difference in approaches depends on the sets
    of available data, methods, and tools for their analysis. In [12], three main
    areas are indicated: measurements of soil electrical conductivity, monitoring
    of vegetation indices based on satellite images, and data on yield. The study
    [12], was based on mapping the NDVI at a certain time for different purposes.
    From the point of view of methods, artificial intelligence methods were used to
    calculate important parameters of irrigation, such as soil moisture and salinity,
    modeling the water-soil regime and the transfer of solutes [41]–[44]. However,
    all these approaches have drawbacks and require further research. There is an
    acute issue of the need to create maps of prescriptions in dynamics since the
    state of plants and the environment has a high dynamic of changes. The so-called
    dynamic spatial-temporal adaptation is needed. And the accuracy of such adaptation
    can be achieved only by using a combination of artificial intelligence methods.
    In our study, to determine dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control, we used the methods of artificial neural networks, data mining,
    and phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of crops and the state
    of the soil by plants - indicators. Our model is field-tested in 2020. The key
    factors in assessing the impact of an irrigation strategy are crop yields and
    the amount of irrigation water used. An 8.9% increase in corn yields was recorded
    compared to a plot using conventional irrigation. In addition, the data indicate
    an improvement in the efficiency of irrigation water use. The limitation of this
    study is the impossibility of assessing the productivity of each site through
    the yield map, which will be done in the future. Phytoindications based on computer
    vision of the state of the soil by plants - indicators can be an additional simple
    and cheap tool for analyzing the state of the soil in contrast to the rather expensive
    and not always available to farmers methods of chemical analysis. This study demonstrates
    the possibility of widespread use of artificial intelligence methods, contrary
    to the opinion about the complexity and high cost of such solutions. Further research
    will focus on scaling the results for different farms and climatic conditions
    with a full assessment of economic efficiency. SECTION V. Conclusion Climate change
    has direct implications for the availability of water, which requires the development
    of strategies to optimize its use. Conventional irrigation systems are based on
    the application of a uniform flow across the field, considered as a single spatial
    unit. However, fields can often have spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics,
    relief, microclimate, and crop development. Improving the efficiency of water
    use is one of the main tasks facing the heads of farms today. A large area of
    crops with a pivot irrigation system both in Russia and in the world requires
    a differentiated response to irrigation management. The study is focused on the
    development of neural network methods (from multilayer artificial neural networks
    to pattern recognition and convolutional neural networks) to optimize irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions using 1) regular monitoring
    of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication; 3) predicting
    the dynamic variability of the state of water supply, as well as a knowledge base
    on the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. Since agribusiness
    management systems, such as the “Agrosignal” system we use, are now often used
    by farmers, the use of complex methods of artificial intelligence is becoming
    more accessible. The results of the implementation showed a positive trend in
    decreasing spatial variability and increasing corn yields in this field. Sensor
    information, remote sensing, and neural network techniques have proven to be effective
    in defining dynamic control zones and are attractive due to the ease with which
    they can be implemented at the field scale. This relatively simple approach is
    quite inexpensive for the farmer and can be implemented on a large scale, which
    represents an important and sustainable contribution to improving water use efficiency
    in agriculture, especially in the current scenario of global warming and decreasing
    available water for agriculture. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) may improve center pivot irrigation management,
    including

    deﬁcit irrigation. A remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration model was implemented

    with Landsat imagery to manage irrigations for a VRI equipped center pivot irrigated

    ﬁeld located in West-Central Nebraska planted to maize in 2017 and soybean in

    2018. In 2017, the study included VRI using the model, and uniform irrigation
    using

    neutron attenuation for full irrigation with no intended water stress (VRI-Full
    and

    Uniform-Full treatments, respectively). In 2018, two deﬁcit irrigation treatments
    were

    added (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit, respectively) and the model was modiﬁed
    in an

    attempt to reduce water balance drift; model performance was promising, as it
    was

    executed unaided by measurements of soil water content throughout the season.
    VRI

    prescriptions did not correlate well with available water capacity (R2 < 0.4);
    however,

    they correlated better with modeled ET in 2018 (R2 = 0. 69, VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55,

    VRI-Deﬁcit). No signiﬁcant differences were observed in total intended gross irrigation

    depth in 2017 (VRI-Full = 351 mm, Uniform Full = 344). However, in 2018, VRI resulted

    in lower mean prescribed gross irrigation than the corresponding uniform treatments

    (VRI-Full = 265 mm, Uniform Full = 282 mm, VRI-Deﬁcit = 234 mm, and Uniform Deﬁcit

    = 267 mm). Notwithstanding the differences in prescribed irrigation (in 2018),
    VRI did

    not affect dry grain yield, with no statistically signiﬁcant differences being
    found between

    any treatments in either year (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96
    for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018). Likewise, any reduction
    in

    irrigation application apparently did not result in detectable reductions in deep
    percolation

    potential or actual evapotranspiration. Additional research is needed to further
    vet the

    model as a deﬁcit irrigation management tool. Suggested model improvements include

    a continuous function for water stress and an optimization routine in computing
    the basal

    crop coefﬁcient.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    INTRODUCTION

    Traditionally, the smallest practical management scale for center

    pivot irrigation has been the ﬁeld scale. Thus, irrigation

    applications are typically intended or assumed to be spatially

    uniform throughout a ﬁeld. Variable rate irrigation (VRI)

    technology for center pivots allows for the management scale

    to be much smaller and application rates to vary within a VRI

    equipped ﬁeld. Consequently, VRI has been the subject of recent

    research (e.g., Stone et al., 2015; Sui and Yan, 2017). As remote

    sensing techniques may provide opportunity to quantify spatial

    variability of irrigation requirements, a number of studies have

    investigated various remote-sensing-based technologies for VRI

    management (infrared thermometers, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015;

    canopy reﬂectance, Stone et al., 2016; and Landsat thermal and

    multispectral imagery, Barker et al., 2018b). In western Nebraska

    and other areas of the High Plains, irrigation water withdrawal

    may be limited in availability, or limited by regulation. In

    some of these areas (and other areas globally), signiﬁcant soil

    variability exists, further complicating irrigation management.

    VRI may be beneﬁcial in such areas as the utility of VRI has

    been demonstrated for ﬁelds with variable soil properties (Hedley

    and Yule, 2009). The utility of VRI in improving eﬃciency of

    irrigation (e.g., reducing the fraction of irrigation that runs oﬀ,

    drains below the root zone or is otherwise not available for

    extraction by plant roots), e.g., in situations of limited water

    supply, has also been demonstrated including deﬁcit irrigation

    management (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2016). One reason that VRI

    may be of interest in deﬁcit irrigation management is that it may

    allow for a more spatially uniform managed level of water stress,

    by accounting for soil, and other variability.

    While the beneﬁts of VRI have been studied as cited

    above, a common misunderstanding regarding new irrigation

    technologies is that they “conserve” water, with reduced pumping

    resulting in more water available to downstream users. In an

    ineﬃcient irrigation system, much of the “ineﬃciency” is water

    that deep percolates past the root zone and recharges the aquifer.

    Irrigation technology, if properly managed, may reduce aquifer

    withdrawals, and reduce deep percolation, also reducing aquifer

    recharge but potentially decreasing water quality issues. From a

    watershed scale perspective, the only way to conserve water in

    the aquifer is to reduce consumptive use or evapotranspiration

    (Allen et al., 2003). Stakeholders are rightly concerned about

    aquifer level declines and the subsequent impacts on streamﬂow.

    However, the hypothesis of the current study is that, while

    VRI can be used to reduce pumping or increase yield, it

    does not signiﬁcantly reduce consumptive use. In this study

    this is explored using a spatial evapotranspiration model to

    manage VRI.

    The Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI)

    described by Geli and Neale (2012) has been modiﬁed and

    implemented in VRI research in maize and soybean (common

    commodity crops in the High Plains) by Barker et al. (2018a)

    and Barker et al. (2018b). This model includes a reﬂectance-

    based crop coeﬃcient evapotranspiration (ET) model, wherein

    the basal crop coeﬃcient is related to a multispectral vegetation

    index (Neale et al., 1989). SETMI uses relationships developed for

    maize and soybean in Nebraska by Campos et al. (2017). SETMI

    also contains a version of the two-source energy balance (TSEB;

    Norman et al., 1995) as detailed in Barker et al. (2018a). Notably,

    SETMI contains what is referred to as a hybrid methodology,

    wherein ET from an energy balance model is incorporated into

    the water balance through statistical interpolation (Geli, 2012;

    Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a). This hybrid model is

    intended to allow the model to compensate for model drift in the

    soil water balance (Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a,b).

    While SETMI had been tested for VRI management in western

    Nebraska (Barker et al., 2018b), it had only been tested on

    maize and the soil water balance was found to drift compared

    to neutron attenuation soil water measurements (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Subsequently, modiﬁcations have been made to SETMI

    discussed by Barker et al. (2018b), including dampening surface

    soil evaporation and provisions for incorporating soil water

    measurements into the model. These modiﬁcations had not

    previously been tested, though such are included in concurrent

    research by Bhatti (2018). Finally, no attempt has previously been

    made to test SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation in row crops in the

    western High Plains, though others have studied deﬁcit irrigation

    in the area, for example, Payero et al. (2005) studied deﬁcit

    irrigation in soybean in West-Central Nebraska. However, they

    did not include VRI in their study.

    The objective of the present study was to determine whether

    VRI management using SETMI, when compared to “uniform”

    irrigation, resulted in reduced irrigation applications, reduced

    consumptive use (ET), improvements in yield, and/or reduced

    impact on local water resources as represented by reductions

    in deep percolation (DP) potential. A secondary objective was

    to determine whether SETMI would perform well as a deﬁcit

    irrigation management tool, which could be accomplished by

    accurately simulating soil water content.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    SETMI was tested as an irrigation management tool in a 2-year

    ﬁeld experiment in maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018 in western

    Nebraska. This experiment builds upon previous work by Barker

    et al. (2018b), and is complimentary to research by Bhatti (2018).

    Primary response variables were yield, change in soil water

    storage over the measurement period (1SWS), estimated deep

    percolation (DP) during the measurement period, the sum of

    the latter two variables (1SWS+ DP), modeled ET (ETc), and

    water balance measured ET (ETa). The 1SWS+DP represents

    an approximation of the impact on deep drainage from the

    treatments during the measurement periods (beginning prior

    to imposing treatments and ending near harvest). It represents

    potential diﬀerences in groundwater recharge, and nutrient

    leaching capacity.

    Study Location

    The study location for this experiment was a quarter of a ∼48-

    ha center pivot irrigated ﬁeld, which is part of the University

    of Nebraska-Lincoln’s West Central Water Resources Field

    Laboratory, near Brule, NE (41.027◦N, 101.973◦W; Google Earth

    Pro, accessed 8 August 2018; Figure 1). The ﬁeld is irrigated

    pivot equipped with Lindsay Precision VRI with individual

    nozzle control. The pivot was new in 2015 and is equipped

    with Senninger XiWob UP3 sprinklers (Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clermont, FL) on drops ∼2 m above the ground surface (Barker

    et al., 2018b).

    Soils in the study area range from loam (Santana loam) to

    loamy sand (Bankard loamy sand) and loam–gravel complex

    (Santana-Dix complex) (Soil Survey Staﬀ, 2018). The terrain is

    undulating hills with soil texture varying with topography. The

    Koppen-Gieger Climate class for the location is Bsk (cold arid,

    dry summer; Kottek et al., 2006; Brugger, 2017).

    Crops were planted following a circular pattern and the

    center pivot wheel tracks. The ﬁeld was under continuous maize

    production for several years prior to rotating into soybean in the

    2018 season. The ﬁeld was managed as no-till, but was subject

    to a residue removal study prior to 2017 (van Donk et al., 2012;

    Barker et al., 2018b). In 2017, the study area was under a maize

    crop Dekalb DKC55-20RIB planted at 78,740 seeds ha1 on 8

    May 2017. A total of 231 kg ha−1 of N was applied with ∼25%

    applied through fertigation. The maize was harvested for grain

    between 4 and 16 November 2017. In 2018, the crop was soybean

    Pioneer P24A99X, planted at 457,720 seeds ha1 on 8 May 2018.

    The soybean crop was harvested for grain on 26 September 2018.

    Treatments and Irrigation Management

    In 2017, two irrigation treatments were applied: (1) VRI using

    SETMI with Landsat imagery, and (2) uniform irrigation using

    neutron attenuation based measurements of soil water content

    to provide feedback for irrigation scheduling. Both treatments

    were full irrigation, with no intentional water stress, thus they

    are referred to as VRI-Full, and Uniform-Full, respectively.

    In 2018, two additional treatments were added. These two

    treatments were both deﬁcit irrigation and corresponded to

    the two full irrigation treatments in the modeling and neutron

    probe feedback approaches (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit,

    respectively). Thus in 2018, the experiment became a two-by-

    two factorial layout. Deﬁcit irrigation as deﬁned here included

    an irrigation management allowed soil water depletion that was

    greater than would be used for minimal water stress management

    during part of the growing season. Additionally, in 2017,

    SETMI was executed using the hybrid method and incorporating

    neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content. However in

    2018, SETMI was executed without these two methodologies (i.e.,

    the reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET model based on Landsat

    satellite multispectral inputs and water balance were exclusively

    used). This was because the hybrid methodology was found to

    induce model drift necessitating the incorporation of neutron

    probe measurements. By eliminating the hybrid model in 2018,

    a SETMI-only approach could be tested. This was deemed more

    beneﬁcial than maintaining the 2017 modeling approach.

    The irrigation was managed similarly to Barker et al. (2018b),

    using the concept of a managed root zone water balance and

    management allowed depletion (Woodruﬀ et al., 1972; Martin

    et al., 1990). This method, used by Barker et al. (2018b) provides

    a convenient way to manage VRI and to apply treatments to VRI

    equipped irrigated ﬁelds. The basics of the method are (Barker

    et al., 2018b):

    • Determine soil properties (e.g., available water capacity) for

    each plot or management area.

    • Determine a management allowed depletion fraction for the

    treatment or ﬁeld.

    • Determine a target stored root zone soil water depth above

    management allowed depletion after irrigation, to which the

    root zone will be reﬁlled during an irrigation event. A value of

    ∼20 mm (0.8 in) was used in this study thus providing a soil

    water storage buﬀer for rainfall capture.

    • Compute the water balance, forecasting ET forward in

    time (precipitation could also be forecasted; soil water

    measurements could be incorporated). Similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b), the VRI treatments received plot-speciﬁc irrigation

    based on mean modeled soil water depletion within a ∼9 m

    buﬀer area in each plot. In this study, the water balance for the

    VRI plots was computed using SETMI.

    • Irrigation application depth is computed for any desired

    date as the diﬀerence between the target water content

    (the speciﬁed depth above management allowed depletion)

    and the modeled water content at the end of the day in

    question assuming no water inputs after inputting the available

    water record. This diﬀerence, if positive, is the net irrigation

    requirement for the plot or management area to be applied by

    the end of that day.

    • Irrigation is triggered such to prevent any plot from exceeding

    management allowed depletion (described in the following

    paragraph). Thus, irrigation events occur at the same time

    for all treatments, but application rates vary by treatment

    and/or plot.

    • Maximum and minimum gross application rates (accounting

    for application eﬃciency) are applied as necessary for pivot

    and pump management. In this study application eﬃciency

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    (taken here to be the portion of applied irrigation that was

    inﬁltrated) was assumed to be 85%.

    • Irrigation prescriptions are set to a practical irrigation

    application depth (optional). In this study, gross applied

    irrigation was rounded to the nearest ∼5 mm (0.2 in).

    For the full irrigation treatments, management allowed depletion

    (MAD) was set to 50%. Late in the 2017 season, the MAD

    was allowed to reach 60% as in Yonts et al. (2008), but it was

    maintained at 50% throughout the season for soybean in 2018.

    The management allowed depletion was set to 60% for the deﬁcit

    treatments in 2018; this was increased to 75% after reaching the

    end pod-ﬁll stage following the principles of Kranz and Specht

    (2012) who suggest avoiding stress during pod-ﬁll. This strategy

    implicitly seeks to maximize yield with perhaps only modest

    reductions in applied irrigation, since water stress may aﬀect

    soybean yield during pod-ﬁlling more than other crop stages

    (Doss et al., 1974; Momen et al., 1979; Cox and Jolliﬀ, 1986;

    Kranz and Specht, 2012). The soybean crop was near beginning

    pod-ﬁll when the treatments eﬀectively began to be applied in

    2018; thus the deﬁcit irrigated plots may have been insulated

    from yield loss per Kranz and Specht (2012). However, Doss et al.

    (1974), reported that stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more

    consistent at causing a yield reduction than when stress was only

    earlier in the season.

    Irrigation prescriptions were computed about once per week

    during the treatment periods. In 2017, the treatment period

    began on 9 August; prior to this time a total of 182 mm of uniform

    irrigation was applied. In 2018, the treatment period eﬀectively

    began on 13 August. Prior to that time, all treatments eﬀectively

    received 119 mm of uniform irrigation.

    Modeling

    Modeling for Irrigation Scheduling

    Irrigation prescriptions for the uniform plots were based

    upon neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content (see the

    Measurements and Response Variables section) and a short-

    term simple soil water balance including ET modeled using crop

    coeﬃcients based on (Allen and Wright, 2002) for maize in

    2017 and using relationships reported by Irmak et al. (2013) for

    soybean in 2018. Uniform treatments received irrigation based

    on neutron-attenuation-measured soil water depletion and a

    simple water balance for one plot of the treatment in 2017 and the

    maximum irrigation requirement of two selected plots in each of

    the 2018 uniform treatments.

    prescriptions

    for

    the

    VRI

    treatments

    were

    computed using the SETMI application, with model formulations

    similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b). The

    SETMI water balance model was modiﬁed prior to use in 2018

    to include other updates to the FAO56 (Allen et al., 1998)

    methodology, which are described in Jensen and Allen (2016).

    The model includes a daily water balance generally following

    Allen et al. (1998), with ET computed using reﬂectance based

    crop coeﬃcients following Campos et al. (2017) and Barker

    et al. (2018a). In 2017, the hybrid method within SETMI was

    included using TSEB-computed ET (using the Priestly-Taylor

    approximation for canopy latent heat ﬂux; Norman et al., 1995;

    Colaizzi et al., 2014) and a statistical interpolation weighting

    factor from Barker et al. (2018a) equal to 0.56. To prevent model

    drift, in 2017, measured soil water depletions from neutron

    attenuation measurements were incorporated into the model as

    the actual end-of-day root zone depletion on the measurement

    date. In this, neutron attenuation measurements from four

    plots in the VRI-Full treatment were compared to model

    output depletion for the same plots. The four selected plots

    had the maximum, minimum, 33 percentile, and 66 percentile

    values of volumetric water content measurements, respectively,

    for that treatment on 27 June 2017. The reasoning was to

    include locations spread across the distribution of soil water

    content. Modeled depletion for all computation pixels was then

    updated based upon correlation between these measurements

    and modeled soil water depletion if R2 ≥ 0.6, or the mean

    diﬀerence between the measured and modeled values for those

    four locations otherwise as in Bhatti (2018). This adjustment

    was to reduce model drift. In 2018, this methodology was not

    used because excluding the hybrid methodology was expected

    to reduce model drift. For the 2018 simulations, the model was

    initiated with soil water content assumed to be at ﬁeld capacity.

    Spatial Soil Properties

    Prior to execution in 2018, the SETMI water balance model

    was also modiﬁed to include a slow root zone drainage routine

    using the drainage equations of Raes et al. (2017); soil below

    the root zone was assumed to have instantaneous drainage

    whenever water content exceeded ﬁeld capacity. Furthermore,

    the model was expanded to allow for the input of properties

    for three soil layers. The properties for the root zone were

    computed as depth-weighted averages of layers within the

    root zone on a given day. Saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat) for the root zone, a key parameter in the drainage

    formulas (Raes et al., 2017), was computed throughout the

    season (as root depth increased) based upon Equation 3.10 of

    Radcliﬀe and Šimunek (2010):

    Ksatr =

    Zri

    P3

    j=1

    1Zrij

    Ksatj

    (1)

    where the subscript Ksatr is Ksat in the root zone, Zr is

    the root zone depth, 1Zr is the thickness of a soil layer

    within the root zone, with subscripts i and j being time

    and soil layer, respectively. This method is for steady-state,

    saturated ﬂow. However, it provided a practical means of

    computing Ksat for the root zone and allowed the model

    to stay within the framework of a simple water balance

    (Allen et al., 1998; Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil properties for each plot were estimated from neutron

    attenuation, lab measurements, and the gSSURGO (Soil Survey

    Staﬀ, 2015) database. Field capacity (FC) was computed using

    the maximum neutron attenuation measurement from the 1

    June and 27 June 2017 measurements for each depth and plot,

    using the concept of observational FC (Lo et al., 2017). For 2017

    irrigation management, plot FC was then computed by taking

    the depth-weighted average of this maximum water content from

    the soil surface to 1 m. For 2018 irrigation scheduling, the same

    data were used to compute FC; however FC was computed

    for three soil layers (0–0.23, 0.23–0.61, and 0.61–1.22 m) using

    depth-weighted averages. For the ﬁnal analysis, FC was computed

    as in 2018 irrigation scheduling with the lowest layer being

    0.61–1.0 m and the inclusion of an improved neutron probe

    calibration for 27 June 2017, which changed some of ﬁnal plot

    FC values.

    Permanent

    wilting

    point

    (WP)

    was

    determined

    from

    laboratory measurements on soil samples from 16 plots. WP

    was determined for each sample using a WP4-T Dewpoint

    PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) assuming a

    potential of −1.5 MPa for WP. The resulting WP values were

    correlated with respective FC values for the same plot and depth

    from the 1 June and 27 June 2017 data (R2 = 0.72; Figure 2). The

    resulting relationship was applied depth-by-depth to compute

    WP for all plots corresponding to the respective FC estimation

    methods (i.e., 2017, 2018, and ﬁnal analysis). The regression was

    recalculated for ﬁnal analysis using the updated neutron probe

    calibration mentioned above. However, this made no diﬀerence

    in the resulting WP for the ﬁnal analysis when rounded to the

    nearest 0.01 m3 m−3.

    In 2018, the inclusion of the drainage equations from Raes

    et al. (2017) required the input of both volumetric soil water

    content at saturation (θsat) and saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat). These values were obtained for each plot and soil layer

    using values from gSSURGO and relationships with FC. The FC

    for these relationships was computed based on volumetric water

    content at −1.5 MPa and available water capacity (AWC) for

    the soil horizons of the dominant components of the four soil

    map units in the study area. This was done assuming this was

    a better estimate of FC than was water content at −0.033 MPa.

    A piecewise linear relationship was developed for θsat using linear

    regression for values of FC < 0.25 m3 m−3 (R2 = 0.92), and

    then the average of all θsat for FC > 0.25 m3 m−3 (Figure 3A). A

    power regression ﬁt well (R2 = 0.96) for Ksat as a function of FC

    (Figure 3B). The relationships in Figure 3 were used in irrigation

    scheduling in 2018 and in ﬁnal analysis, using the respective soil

    layer FC values.

    Model Input Data

    Other spatial model inputs included Landsat 7 and Landsat

    8 multispectral imagery obtained from U.S. Geological Survey

    (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). This imagery included Level 2

    Surface Reﬂectance and Level 1 thermal infrared imagery (2017

    only). Thermal infrared imagery were corrected for atmospheric

    eﬀects similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b),

    whose method was based upon Brunsell and Gillies (2002).

    The correction parameters from NASA’s Atmospheric Correction

    Parameter web app (https://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/, by J. Barsi)

    were used. Local surface weather data described below were input

    to the web application. Only Tier 1 and Real Time imagery

    were used for irrigation scheduling (with the exception of 5

    August 2017, which was a Tier 2 image, included as Real

    Time quality). In the ﬁnal analysis, only Tier 1 imagery were

    included. Landsat 7 imagery were included if no pixels were

    missing due to the scan line gap over the entire study plot

    area. Thirteen images were included in 2017 and 14 images

    in 2018. Not all images were included in irrigation scheduling

    or ﬁnal analysis (Table 1); for example, images were included

    in the ﬁnal analysis that were not available during irrigation

    scheduling and some used in irrigation scheduling in 2017

    were determined to not be of suﬃcient quality to use in ﬁnal

    analysis. The model was executed using a ground resolution of

    1 m in 2017 and 5 m in 2018 and ﬁnal analysis to account for

    discrepancies between Landsat pixel size and position and the

    plot geometry (Bhatti, 2018).

    Weather data for modeling were obtained from three

    Nebraska Mesonet (https://mesonet.unl.edu/) weather stations:

    Big Springs 8NE, Brule 6SW, and Keystone 3W Beta. The

    Brule 6SW data were used for near real-time data for irrigation

    management in 2017 and for the ﬁnal analysis. The Big Springs

    8NE data were used for near real-time data in 2018. This

    weather station was nearby and was used thinking it was the

    Brule 6SW station, which was adjacent to the research ﬁeld.

    The diﬀerence was expected to be small; however the Brule

    6SW station was still determined to be the best suited for

    the ﬁnal analysis. The nearby Keystone 3W Beta data were

    used to compute 20-year historic average reference ET (ETr)

    and temperatures for growing degree-day computation, both

    used for ET forecasting similar to Barker et al. (2018b). This

    station was used because the records for the Brule 6SW and

    Big Springs 8NE stations were not suﬃciently long. ETr was

    computed using the ASCE Standardized Reference ET equation

    (ASCE, 2005). Barometric pressure was obtained from a nearby

    cosmic-ray neutron probe station and was provided by T. E.

    Franz (University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Precipitation from the

    Brule 6SW weather station was veriﬁed in 2017 using a lab-

    calibrated, Texas Electronics, Inc. (Dallas, TX) TR-525USW

    rain gauge coupled with a H07-002-04 HOBO Event Data

    Logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) installed

    near the northwest corner of the ﬁeld. These latter data were

    also used from 1 to 8 November 2017, because the Brule

    6SW dataset did not cover this period. Data from the National

    Weather Service Global Historic Climate Network Ogallala NE

    station were used for 9–13 November 2017 because neither

    the lab-calibrated rain gauge nor the Brule 6SE data were

    available. Weather data for the Mesonet and National Weather

    Service stations were obtained from the High Plains Regional

    Climate Center.

    Besides precipitation, the other major water balance input for

    modeling was applied irrigation. The prescribed irrigation was

    assumed to be applied (with an application eﬃciency of 85%—

    used throughout the study) on the day that the pivot passed over

    the plots. In the case that the pivot passed over the plots during

    the night (covering two dates), the irrigation was attributed to

    plots on the date it was estimated to pass over them in the 2017

    irrigation scheduling. The average pivot travel speed from start-

    stop times and travel angle were used to determine the overpass

    time for plots. Irrigation depth was assigned typically the latter of

    the two dates in 2018 scheduling, for simplicity. In ﬁnal analysis,

    the earlier of the two dates was used in all cases, because this

    would make the water available sooner to alleviate any modeled

    water stress (see the formulations of Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil Water Content Model Validation

    Since the value of SETMI in this research was in modeling

    soil water content, the model performance was validated using

    neutron attenuation measurements after the ﬁrst measurement.

    Missing measurements in both years and for the 2018 plots that

    were aﬀected by the irrigation system malfunction during this

    season were excluded. The model was executed using only the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET and water balance. The ﬁrst

    neutron attenuation measurements each year were incorporated

    into the model as described in the Measurement and Response

    Variables section.

    Measurements and Response Variables

    The total prescribed irrigation depth (the total gross irrigation

    depth for each plot that was used in the executed irrigation

    prescriptions) was analyzed as a primary treatment comparison.

    This was assumed to be equivalent to the actual gross applied

    irrigation for each plot. The ﬁnal irrigation in both years (applied

    19 September 2017 and 14 September 2018, respectively) were

    not applied and/or computed as intended. In the case of 19

    September 2017, the prescription for the previous irrigation (14

    September 2017) was applied in what was probably a logistically

    practical situation. In the case of 14 September 2018, the applied

    prescription from 8 September 2018 was not converted from

    inches to mm before input into SETMI, thus the prescribed

    irrigation was erroneously high for some plots. In both cases,

    both total applied prescribed (total prescribed irrigation as

    deﬁned above) and the total intended prescribed gross irrigation

    (or the total gross irrigation if correcting for the errors described

    above in the paragraph) were analyzed. The pivot had some low

    pressure problems in 2017. However, these may have been related

    to a pressure sensor (not actual pressure) and were assumed

    not to have aﬀected sprinkler application and uniformity. To

    assess the ability of the VRI methodology on accounting for

    spatially varying irrigation requirements, intended prescribed

    irrigation was compared to available water capacity (AWC) and

    plot modeled ET (ETc; described later in this section).

    Primary measurements included grain yield and soil water

    content. Plot yield was computed from production yield

    monitor data, which was cleaned and processed using the U.S.

    Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service’s Yield

    Editor 2.0.7 software (Sudduth et al., 2012) similar to Barker

    et al. (2018b). Yield points were only included if they were

    within a ∼12 m buﬀer within each plot boundary (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Plots included in the ﬁnal statistics had 22–47 yield

    points within the buﬀer in 2017 and 26–45 points in 2018. Dry

    grain yield was computed using the yield monitor’s moisture

    content measurements.

    *Used to compute ﬁeld capacity.

    †Attributed to previous day during ﬁnal analysis.

    ‡All data were used as if collected on 31 July. For irrigation scheduling, only
    standard

    neutron counts from 31 July were used.

    Soil water content measurements were used in computing

    the other response variables. Soil volumetric water content

    was measured in each plot using neutron probes (503 Elite

    Hydroprobe, CPN, Concord, CA). Access tubes were installed

    in the approximate center of each plot. The neutron probe

    instruments used were either locally calibrated or cross-

    calibrated with a locally-calibrated probe. The local calibration

    was conducted in a ﬁeld immediately east of the study site. Local

    calibration of a gauge used in the study resulted in a slope of

    0.2068 and an oﬀset of −0.0607. Calibrations were applied at a

    4 decimal accuracy in 2017 and ﬁnal analysis; they were applied

    at a higher numerical precision in 2018 irrigation, though this

    was of little consequence. Neutron attenuation measurements

    were taken at the following soil depths with measurements

    assumed to represent the range in parentheses: 0.15 (0–0.23 m),

    0.30 (0.23–0.38 m), 0.46 (0.38–0.61 m), 0.76 (0.61–0.91 m), 1.07

    (0.91–1.22 m), and 1.37 m (1.22–1.52 m). Neutron attenuation

    measurements were limited in temporal frequency in 2017 and

    in seasonal coverage in 2018 (Table 2). However, the coverage

    in both years began before the treatment period had eﬀectively

    started and ﬁnished near harvest. For modeling purposes in

    irrigation scheduling, neutron attenuation measurements were

    treated as the actual root zone water content at the end of

    the measurement date for the VRI-Full treatment in 2017 and

    the uniform treatments in both years. However, some neutron

    attenuation data were shifted to represent the ending conditions

    on the previous day for ﬁnal analysis depending on rainfall

    and irrigation on the measurement day (Table 2). The neutron

    attenuation data for the 0.91–1.22 m depth for two plots for all

    2018 dates except 10 July 2018 were gap ﬁlled for ﬁnal analysis.

    These were ﬁlled using the respective measurement value from

    the 0.61–0.91 m reading.

    The response variables relating to the impact of treatments

    on DP and ET were all derived from the neutron attenuation

    data. The ﬁrst was 1SWS in mm in the top 1.0 m of the

    soil proﬁle (using the 1.07-m reading to represent 0.91–1.0 m)

    between the ﬁrst and last neutron attenuation measurement each

    year (Table 2). Modeled DP and ETc were computed using the

    SETMI water balance with soil properties described for ﬁnal

    analysis. In modeling DP and ETc, the depth-weighted neutron

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    attenuation measurements were incorporated as the actual root

    zone depletions and the average water contents of the soil

    below the root zone (down to 1.0 m below ground surface) at

    the end of the ﬁrst date each year (Table 2). This is similar

    to the method used by Djaman and Irmak (2013). A similar

    method, but using repeated soil water content measurements

    as model input was used by Barker et al. (2018b). ET was also

    computed using the residual of the water balance (ETa). Both

    ETc and ETa were included as response variables. The ﬁnal

    variable considered was the sum 1SWS and DP (1SWS+DP).

    For all of these variables, the neutron-attenuation-measured

    values were assumed to represent the entire plot area. The plot-

    average modeled root depth (based upon time to reach peak

    basal crop coeﬃcient for each pixel) was used to compute root

    zone depletion and average volumetric water content below

    the root zone from the neutron attenuation data. The average

    root depth was computed as a spatial mean for each plot and

    neutron attenuation date excluding a ∼9 m buﬀer within each

    plot boundary (Barker et al., 2018b). The model was executed at a

    5-m pixel resolution in the ﬁnal analysis. The response variables

    were also computed as spatial means excluding the same ∼9 m

    buﬀer within each plot boundary.

    Experimental Design and Statistical

    Analysis

    The experiment was a generalized randomized complete block

    design, with multiple replicates of at least some treatments in

    each block. The study area was broken into plots ∼0.2 ha in

    size accommodating the precision of the sprinkler system and

    the commercial combine yield monitor similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b). Plots were arranged radially with plot boundaries falling

    on pivot wheel tracks (Figure 1). The plots were designed with

    criteria of a minimum of ∼37 m in width and length (Barker

    et al., 2018b). Plots were grouped into six blocks using computed

    AWC for the top 1 m of soil (as computed for the 2017 irrigation

    scheduling) as the blocking criterion. Plots were not blocked by

    radial distance from the center based on results of Barker et al.

    (2018b). Treatments were randomly assigned to plots afresh in

    both years (Figure 1).

    Responses for each treatment and variable were compared

    using ANOVAs computed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS 9.4

    (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The ANOVAs were computed

    separately for the 2 crop years and for each variable (i.e.,

    no MANOVAs were included). Total prescribed irrigation was

    compared using 95% conﬁdence intervals computed using SAS

    PROC MEANS to compare with the uniform treatments as in

    Barker et al. (2018b). ANOVA was used to compare irrigation for

    the two VRI treatments in 2018.

    A number of plots were discarded from the ﬁnal analysis based

    upon missing data or misapplication of irrigation. In 2017, a

    total of six plots received an erroneous application depth during

    one of the irrigation events. These plots were all Uniform-Full,

    the misapplication aﬀected some VRI-Full plots also, but that

    would have automatically been compensated for in the following

    irrigation prescription. Another plot had water in the neutron

    access tube on the 13 November 2017 measurement and was

    also excluded. All seven plots were excluded from ﬁnal analysis

    for 2017. An additional two plots in 2017 did not have neutron

    attenuation data for 20 July 2017. For 2017, only data for plots

    and measurement dates that had missing data were excluded

    from validating the modeled water content. In 2018, two banks

    of four sprinklers did not function properly during much, if

    not all, of the irrigation season. Based upon the pivot dealer’s

    sprinkler chart (provided by Holzfaster’s Equipment, Ogallala,

    NE, and computed using software by Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clemont, FL, 6 February 2015), the aﬀected areas were near the

    center of the second and sixth radial rows of plots from the

    pivot center (Figure 1). Thus, a total of 14 plots were aﬀected,

    one of which was also missing neutron attenuation data. All 14

    plots were eliminated from the ﬁnal analysis for 2018. One of

    the aﬀected plots in 2018 was used to schedule irrigation for the

    Uniform-Full treatment. However, this treatment always received

    the maximum irrigation depth during a given irrigation cycle.

    Given that the aﬀected sprinklers were likely always on (a default

    conditions of the system; personal communication, Lindsay

    Corporation personnel), this plot would not have adversely

    aﬀected that treatment.

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

    Study Conditions

    The May–September total ETr was 1,020 mm in 2017 and

    910 mm in 2018 for the Brule 6SW station, comparable to a 20-

    years average of 1,080 mm for 1998–2017 for the Keystone 3W

    Beta station. This is also similar to the 950–1,050 mm reported

    by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for 1986–2009 for this part of

    Nebraska. Total May–September precipitation was 280 mm in

    2017 and 400 mm in 2018, compared to 290 mm for the 1998–

    2017 20-year average for Keystone 3W Beta. This is also similar

    to the 280–320 mm reported by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for

    1986–2009 for the area.

    In addition to weather, the soil properties at the site may

    greatly aﬀect an irrigation experiment. Using the ﬁnal analysis

    values, FC in the top 1 m of the soil proﬁle ranged from 0.11

    to 0.30 m3 m−3. The range of WP values was smaller, 0.05–0.16

    m3 m−3. Calculated AWC for the plots ranged from 0.06 to 0.14

    m3 m−3. This translates into 60–140 mm over a 1-m managed

    root zone.

    Modeling and Treatment Execution

    The incorporation of TSEB-ET in 2017 had a general eﬀect of

    increasing modeled soil water depletion (decreasing soil water

    content). This was in part because of the nature of the piecewise

    water stress coeﬃcient used (Ks; Allen et al., 1998; Figure 4).

    That is, Ks is equal to unity when the modeled root zone water

    content is above the water stress threshold (Allen et al., 1998;

    Figure 4). In the hybrid methodology, the ET modeled by the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient method in the water balance

    (WB-ET) is updated based upon TSEB-ET. If TSEB-ET ̸= WB-

    ET, then the water balance is updated by back-calculating for Ks

    and then back calculating for start-of-day root zone depletion

    (Geli, 2012). For example, assume that the TSEB-ET had little

    mean bias as compared with the WB-ET. At times, it would

    (Ks) function based on average root zone soil water content, as used in Allen

    et al. (1998) and Jensen and Allen (2016).

    be expected that TSEB-ET < WB-ET, even under non-stressed

    conditions, due solely to model variation. This condition would

    result in a decrease of Ks after TSEB-ET incorporation, whether

    such represented reality or not. However, at times when TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, and the water balance already indicates a Ks < 1;

    mathematically, the soil water depletion can only be decreased

    (soil water content increased) as far as the water stress threshold

    (Figure 4). It is noted that in cases where Ks = 1 and TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, no adjustment is made (Barker et al., 2018a).

    These challenges led to exclusion of the TSEB-ET in 2018. One

    possible solution for these challenges may be the inclusion of a

    continuous Ks function. For example the relationship of Jensen

    (1970) has been used for similar purposes (Colaizzi et al., 2003,

    Zhang et al., 2017). Another non-linear relationship presented by

    Boonyantharokul and Walker (1979) is also promising because

    the shape could be modiﬁed to account for diﬀerent sensitivity

    to stress in diﬀerent crops as is done in the piecewise method

    used by Allen et al. (1998). A ﬁnal solution may be incorporation

    of ET in parts (evaporation and transpiration) using canopy and

    soil components from the TSEB. This may help better identify

    what ET diﬀerences are truly related to Ks. The Penman Monteith

    formulation of the TSEB has been reported to provide more

    accurate partitioning of ET than original formulations (Colaizzi

    et al., 2014).

    Possible modiﬁcations to the hybrid model aside, the

    discrepancies in scale of the Landsat thermal infrared imagery

    (60–100 m; Bhatti, 2018; USGS, 2019) and our plot size was

    also a reason for dropping the TSEB-ET in 2018. It was evident

    that incorporating the soil water content measurements into the

    SETMI water balance in 2017 prevented what seemed to be a

    likely bias toward a dry modeled root zone. Thus, it was expected

    that without the TSEB-ET, the neutron attenuation data was

    less necessary. Furthermore, the water balance model had not

    previously been tested in this climate for soybean without soil

    water content measurement incorporation, as it has been for

    maize (Barker et al., 2018b).

    One ﬁnal challenge encountered with using the SETMI model

    was the division of Landsat images as being either early or

    late in the season with regards to computing the basal crop

    coeﬃcient time series (see Barker et al., 2018a). In this, images

    either contribute to the increasing portion of the crop coeﬃcient,

    before and up-to peak value, or they contribute to the decreasing

    portion of the crop coeﬃcient after peak. In the case of 2017, the

    best cutoﬀ was not the same for all pixels. For example, if only

    imagery before 21 July 2017 was included in the development

    portion of the season, then crop coeﬃcients were poorly ﬁt for

    ∼13 plots. However, if the cutoﬀ was set to include 21 July 2017 in

    the development portion of the season, all performed reasonably

    well, but some not as well as if 21 July 2017 was forced to be

    late in the season. Ultimately, 21 July 2017 was allowed to be

    a development period image for all plots. The eﬀect was small

    in terms of modeled root zone depletion. Ultimately, the model

    would be improved by adding an optimization routine based on

    goodness of ﬁt to determine the best cutoﬀ date for each pixel.

    Model Performance

    The modeled 1-m average proﬁle soil volumetric water content

    (θp) had a negative mean bias error (MBE) of ∼-0.03 m3 m−3,

    with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼0.04 m3 m−3, in

    2017 (Figure 5). These results may be improved with model

    calibration, including reducing soil evaporation. Assuming a 1.5-

    m root zone did not appreciably improve results for 2017. Model

    performance was improved in 2018 soybean with modeled θp

    for the top 1-m having a MBE < 0.01 m3 m−3 and an RMSE

    ≈ 0.02 m3 m−3. These results represent an improvement over

    results in the same ﬁeld in 2017. Furthermore, these results

    indicate that the water balance model in SETMI is suitable

    for irrigation management under these conditions without the

    periodic incorporation of secondary datasets as was done in

    2017. Assessing the uncertainty associated with using SETMI

    for irrigation management was beyond the scope of this study.

    However, such is acknowledged as a possible source of variability

    and error presented in Figure 5.

    Prescribed Irrigation

    For the 2017 season, the VRI-Full treatment had a range (across

    plots) of 314–375 mm for prescribed gross irrigation depth

    and a range of 304–375 mm for intended prescriptions. When

    comparing treatment means, the total prescribed irrigation

    was essentially the same for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full treatments (353 and 355 mm, respectively; Table 3). The

    mean total intended prescribed irrigation was also similar (351

    and 344 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively,

    Table 3). With a 95% conﬁdence interval of the mean of ±

    9 mm for the applied VRI-Full and ± 10 mm for the intended

    VRI-Full, the two treatments were not statistically diﬀerent and

    practically the same. This is logical as both treatments included

    incorporation of neutron attenuation measurements.

    In 2018, total intended gross prescribed irrigation application

    depth ranged from 236 to 277 mm for VRI-Full and 216 to

    241 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. The range was 246–282 mm for applied

    prescribed gross irrigation for VRI-Full and 221–246 mm for

    VRI-Deﬁcit. In that year total applied prescribed irrigation

    was statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (t = 17.7) for both VRI

    treatments. Both were also diﬀerent from the two uniform

    treatments. Total intended prescribed irrigation was likewise

    diﬀerent for the two VRI treatments (t = 10.2) with only the

    VRI-Full and Uniform-Deﬁcit not being diﬀerent. The greatest

    total intended irrigation depth was 282 mm for Uniform-Full,

    followed by 267 mm for Uniform-Deﬁcit, 265 mm for VRI-Full,

    and 234 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. Since the uniform treatments had

    no variability in prescribed irrigation, a factorial analysis was

    not performed. However, in both cases intended full irrigation

    was greater than deﬁcit (31 mm greater in the case of VRI

    and 15 mm greater in the case of Uniform). Likewise, intended

    VRI was less than Uniform with Full being 17 mm less and

    Deﬁcit being 33 mm less. It is possible that model bias (Figure 5;

    which was from the ﬁnal analysis, but is still illustrative) may

    have biased the VRI treatments. This could potentially have the

    impact of increasing prescribed irrigation for the VRI treatments.

    It is evident that under our study conditions, adoption of

    VRI based upon reduced water withdrawal alone may not be

    justiﬁable, agreeing with the ﬁndings of Lo et al. (2016), and

    Barker et al. (2018b). Justiﬁcation for VRI would need to include

    other beneﬁts, e.g., changes in yield, lower cost of production

    or reduced nutrient leaching (Lo, 2015; Lo et al., 2016). The

    late imposition of treatments (i.e., the VRI treatments were

    irrigated similar to the Uniform during the ﬁrst portion of

    both years) may also have reduced potential diﬀerences. This

    may particularly be the case for the deﬁcit irrigated soybean

    treatments in 2019, which may have responded diﬀerently had

    the diﬀerent treatments been imposed from the beginning of the

    irrigation season. Furthermore, the Landsat shortwave imagery

    resolution (30 m; USGS, 2019) may limit the ability to address

    the soil and other variability within the study ﬁeld. This may

    have a smoothing eﬀect that may reduce potential beneﬁts of VRI.

    Concurrent research is investigating unmanned aircraft systems

    as a source of high-resolution imagery for VRI management

    with SETMI (Bhatti, 2018). However, the practical management

    scale of VRI may be similar in scale to Landsat as discussed by

    Barker et al. (2018a).

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    FIGURE 6 | Total gross intended irrigation vs. AWC and ETc for VRI-Full plots
    included in the ﬁnal analysis for 2017 maize VRI-Full treatment.

    Irrigation Variability

    The intent of VRI is to manage irrigation at a sub-ﬁeld scale

    to account for sub-ﬁeld scale heterogeneity. In the framework

    of the procedure and modeling used in this study, VRI would

    be anticipated to respond to conditions when spatial variability

    exists for root zone AWC and/or ETc. The total intended

    prescribed irrigation was compared for these two variables for

    each VRI plot included in the ﬁnal analysis. In 2017, the

    correlation between total intended gross irrigation depth and

    AWC was negative, as expected, but it was poor (R2 = 0.26, n

    = 18; Figure 6). The poor correlation is likely a result of the

    hybrid model adjustments to the water balance, which were also

    responsible for much of the model drift. In 2018, the correlation

    between total intended gross irrigation depth and AWC was

    similarly poor (R2 = 0.37, n = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.10, n

    = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit). The prescribed irrigation depth would be

    expected to be highly correlated with AWC under conditions of

    large AWC variability in situations where diﬀerences in rainfall

    storage capacity across soils may be mined (e.g., Lo et al., 2016),

    as may have been expected for 2018, but this was not observed.

    Scale discrepancies between the SETMI modeled scale, which

    was dependent upon Landsat imagery resolution (30 m; USGS,

    2019) and Landsat pixel positioning, and soil variability may have

    also contributed. There was a poor positive correlation between

    intended gross irrigation and ETc (R2 = 0.12; Figure 6) in 2017.

    In 2018 there was a stronger correlation between total intended

    gross irrigation and ETc for both VRI treatments (R2 = 0.69, n

    = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55, n = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit), suggesting

    that variability in ETc was a major driver in 2018. Despite the

    small dataset, the results of the ETc correlations for 2018 may be

    better than 2017 because the ﬁnal ETc values are close to those

    used in irrigation scheduling for 2018, but in 2017 irrigation

    management, the model was updated with other data sources,

    which may have reduced correlation. Attempts to ﬁnd correlation

    between intended gross irrigation and the product and quotient

    of ETc and AWC generally yielded poor results. The ﬁeld has

    variability in ETc even in the VRI-Full treatment, which is a

    response derived from the Landsat imagery and soil properties.

    Yield and Soil Water Storage Response

    In both years, dry grain yield was similar between all included

    treatments (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96 for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018).

    Estimated mean maize grain yield was both statistically and

    practically similar between treatments with 8.91 Mg ha−1 for the

    VRI-Full in 2017 and 8.98 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full (Table 4).

    Variability was, however, notable with 95% conﬁdence intervals

    of the estimated means being ± 6 and ±8% of the estimated

    mean for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively. In 2018,

    the dry grain yield was statistically similar between all treatments

    ranging from 3.33 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full to 3.10 Mg ha−1

    for Uniform-Deﬁcit. However, the variability was substantial,

    ranging from 19% of the estimated mean for Uniform-Full to 24%

    for the VRI-Deﬁcit. This is also notable in the apparent reversal

    of expected response for the VRI-Full and VRI-Deﬁcit treatments

    (3.11 Mg ha-1 and 3.29 Mg ha-1, respectively; Table 4). However,

    it must be remembered that because of the variance of the data,

    these values are statistically the same; thus any conjecture about

    apparent diﬀerences is not valid. It is possible that response

    variance is being induced by the soil variability beyond what is

    captured in the AWC blocking and modeling scale.

    Not only did the irrigation treatments not have a signiﬁcant

    impact on yield, there were also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences

    between treatments for the DP-related variables (1SWS, DP,

    and 1SWS+DP; Table 4). In 2017, 1SWS was similar for both

    treatments (−23 and −20 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full, respectively). 1SWS is presented as a depth-weighted

    average down to 1 m for the last neutron attenuation reading

    minus ﬁrst neutron attenuation reading (Table 2). When deeper

    neutron attenuation values were included, down to 1.52 m, the

    magnitudes increased, but were similar (VRI-Full = −35 mm,

    Uniform-Full = −36 mm; in these deep estimates, three

    additional plots were eliminated because of missing deep neutron

    attenuation readings as compared with the data in Table 4). In

    2017, estimated DP was likewise similar between treatments and

    was practically negligible < 1 mm for both treatments, though the

    diﬀerence was determined to be statistically signiﬁcant.

    We acknowledge that the estimates for the DP-related

    variables are dependent upon the water balance; during the

    period of 2 June−13 November 2017 the total precipitation was

    241 mm with an estimated 4 mm of runoﬀ using the NRCS

    Runoﬀ Equation (NRCS, 2004) with a curve number of 80.

    In computing DP, the SETMI water balance was executed

    for each plot with the initial soil water content condition on

    1 June 2017 taken from neutron attenuation readings. The

    mean total modeled ETc between 2 June and 13 November

    2017 ranged from 567 to 572 mm for the two treatments. The

    corresponding ETa determined from the water balance was

    548 mm (VRI-Full) and 544 mm (Uniform-Full), a 19–28 mm

    diﬀerence. This diﬀerence could have been reduced by further

    dampening the surface soil evaporation rate in SETMI or by

    reducing the water stress threshold or modifying soil properties;

    however the apparent error was ∼5% or less and we deemed

    these adjustments not justiﬁable. Interestingly, the diﬀerences in

    applied irrigation did not translate into meaningful diﬀerences in

    ET, DP, or 1SWS.

    Results for 2018 were similar to 2017, despite the diﬀerences

    in crops, SETMI methodologies, and the inclusion of the deﬁcit

    treatments. The 1SWS ranged from 8 mm (deﬁcit treatments) to

    17 mm for the VRI-Full. 1SWS is presented as a depth weighted

    average down to 1 m. When deeper neutron attenuation values

    were included, down to 1.22 m (many measurement tubes were

    not suﬃciently deep for the 1.52 m readings), the magnitudes

    were practically and statistically similar (5 mm for the deﬁcit

    treatments, 10 mm for Uniform-Full, and 15 mm for VRI-Full).

    In 2018, estimated DP ranged from 5 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit to

    22 mm for Uniform-Full. Signiﬁcant full/deﬁcit factor main

    eﬀects were found (F = 5.91, p = 0.03) for 1SWS+DP, with full

    treatments being 31 mm and deﬁcit being 20 mm (Table 4). Thus,

    deﬁcit irrigation had a small impact on DP potential.

    With respect to water balance, the 2018 DP estimates were

    computed for the period of 10 July−25 September 2018. The

    total precipitation was 125 mm during this period with an

    estimated 16 mm of runoﬀ (computed as in 2017). In 2018,

    the ETa computed as a residual of the water balance ranged

    from 279 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to 299 mm (Uniform-Full), with

    no signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The SETMI modeled ETc had less

    treatment variability ranging from 300 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to

    305 mm (Uniform-Deﬁcit), again with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

    The net diﬀerence between ETa and ETc ranged from 5 mm

    (Uniform-Full) to 21 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit), diﬀerences < 8% of

    ETa. Again, we feel that SETMI performed adequately and

    that the results did not justify further model adjustments in

    computing DP.

    While there was some diﬀerence in irrigation in 2018,

    there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in dry grain yield or ET.

    Interestingly, even the deﬁcit-irrigated treatments where such

    an eﬀect might be expected, did not result in a signiﬁcant yield

    diﬀerence. Part of the cause may be that the deﬁcit treatments

    were eﬀectively not implemented until mid-August (see the

    Treatments section). However, Doss et al. (1974) found that

    stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more consistent at causing

    a yield reduction than when stress occurred only earlier in

    the season. Moreover, the deﬁcit treatment experienced the

    greatest managed stress around the end pod-ﬁll stage and later.

    One ﬁnal observation is that yield and ET in this ﬁeld may

    both be highly governed by nutrient availability in consequence

    of the light soils (T.H. Lo, UNL, personal communication).

    Future work should seek to quantify possible nutrient stress.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    Even though the treatments did not have diﬀerent ET, there

    was the 12 mm diﬀerence in DP potential as represented by

    1SWS+DP between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments.

    This diﬀerence corresponds closely to the diﬀerence in applied

    irrigation between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments

    (12 mm for VRI and 28 mm for uniform). This supports the

    hypothesis that VRI is unlikely to reduce consumptive use;

    however it may reduce deep percolation. In stating this, it should

    be remembered that all treatments were treated similarly in the

    ﬁrst portion of both seasons. This may have dampened some of

    the potential responses.

    CONCLUSIONS

    Ultimately, the results support the conclusion that, under our

    study conditions, VRI managed with SETMI resulted in a

    relatively small, nominal reduction in water withdrawn in 2018

    as compared to uniform treatments; however no diﬀerence was

    observed in 2017. These results are subject to model performance,

    scale, and treatment implementation. Furthermore, irrigation

    treatments did not result in diﬀerences in grain yield. It is

    evident that any variability accounted for in the VRI management

    did not result in corresponding detectable changes in yield.

    Likewise, few statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in

    estimated deep percolation, modeled or water balance measured

    evapotranspiration, change in soil water storage in the top 1 m

    of the proﬁle, or the sum of these latter two variables between

    any treatments in either year. More testing should be performed

    to demonstrate the utility of SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation

    management. The performance of the SETMI water balance

    model in 2018 was promising, as it was executed unaided by on-

    site measurements beyond weather data, FC, and WP. Testing

    over longer periods and varied conditions is necessary to fully

    test that utility. The temporal and spatial scale of Landsat data

    was a concern (especially thermal imagery); alternate satellite

    data products and/or unmanned aircraft imagery may address

    this problem. The proposed modiﬁcations to SETMI, including

    optimization of the basal crop coeﬃcient development, inclusion

    of a non-linear Ks function, and partitioning TSEB-ET, may also

    improve model performance.

    ABSTRACT \nIn the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply\
    \ \nchains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global\
    \ \nproblems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate \nchange,\
    \ and weather disasters. It has known that technological \nopportunities are available\
    \ for human beings to get out of these \npredicaments, solving the interconnections\
    \ between food-water-energy- \nclimate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional \nto digital. \n \nThe aim of this review is to gain holistic\
    \ solutions in a systematic \nview, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural\
    \ digital \ntransformation that will play role in sustainable development. The\
    \ \ntransition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering \nagricultural\
    \ and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital \nagriculture\
    \ combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are \nhandled based\
    \ on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and \nlogistics. Digital\
    \ technologies are explained with application examples \nsuch as the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial \nintelligence, decision\
    \ support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, \nreal-time monitoring systems\
    \ tracking whole conditions of animals in \nlivestock, the IoT-based irrigation\
    \ and fertilization systems that help \nenhance the efficiency of irrigation processes\
    \ and minimize water and \nfertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses,\
    \ blockchain-based \nelectronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and\

    \ Moreover, \nrenewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between \n\
    technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and \nenergy\
    \ production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and \ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a \nresult, for a sustainable\
    \ future, technological innovations that increase \ncrop productivity and improve\
    \ crop quality, protect the environment, \nprovide efficient resource use and\
    \ decrease input costs can help us facing \nin agriculture of today overwhelm\

    \ feed, fibers, fuel, and raw materials by cultivating plants and breeding livestock\
    \ is one of the oldest \nand most vital sources in the civilization of human beings\
    \ and in the economic growth of each country that forms the backbone. \nThe latest\
    \ FAO report (FAO 2017a) emphasized that the world's population will be near 10\
    \ billion by 2050, and agriculture will \nbe a more deeply key role each day for\
    \ the continuation of life and socio-economic development. It has been predicted\
    \ that \nincreases in food, water and energy demands will be 60% (FAO 2012), 55%\
    \ (OECD 2012) and 50% (EIA 2019) by 2050, \nrespectively. \n \nAt global level,\
    \ while consuming approximately 30% of the total energy in during agri-food production,\
    \ this causes nearly \none third of GHG emissions (FAO 2020; Platis et al. 2019).\
    \ Global food systems are responsible for about 25% to 42% of all \nglobal greenhouse\
    \ gas (GHG) emissions emitted during production, processing, transportation, packaging,\
    \ consuming, and \ndisposing of food according to a study carried out for the\
    \ years 1990-2015 (Crippa et al. 2021). \n \nWhile agriculture is the pillar of\
    \ food security, it is the largest user of freshwater that affects energy security\
    \ (Tian et al. \n2018). Global projections indicate that the demand for clean\
    \ water, energy, and food will increase significantly in the coming \nyears (Hoff\
    \ 2011).  \n \nToday, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater use and\
    \ 34% of land use, putting unsustainable pressure on our \nnatural resources (Lee\
    \ 2019). Also, water use is 80-90% in the agri-food sector including irrigation\
    \ (FAO 2016; Bundschuh et \nal. 2107). But irrigation only amounts can reach as\
    \ much as 95 percent in some developing countries (Mohtar & Daher 2016; \nFAO\
    \ 2017b). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n374 \n \nWater plays a key role in socioeconomic\
    \ development that strongly connects food and energy (Daher et al. 2019). Industry\
    \ \nconsumes 22% of water resources, most of which is used for cooling thermal\
    \ processes in electricity generation (EIA 2016). If \naction is not taken now,\
    \ such expanding gap between resource supply and demand would be further occurs\
    \ deep problems related \nto continuous population growth, climate change and\
    \ extreme climatic events, socio-economic development.  \n \nBoth agricultural\
    \ activities and production of food consume at large amounts of water and energy\
    \ (Roidt & Avellán 2019). \nTherefore, water, energy, and food (WEF) are three\
    \ strategic resources for the sustainable development of national economies \n\
    (Purwanto et al. 2019). It is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure sufficient\
    \ WEF with the impact of climate change, \npopulation growth, changing diets,\
    \ urbanization, and aging (Zhang et al. 2018; Alcon et al. 2019).  \n \nAgriculture\
    \ is also a major source of water pollution from nutrients, pesticides, and other\
    \ contaminants, which if unmanaged \ncan lead to significant social, economic,\
    \ and environmental costs (FAO 2017). In the recent decades, agriculture is beset\
    \ by two \nmajor discrepancies: the first conflict is between resources supply\
    \ and demand, while the second conflict is between economic \ndevelopment and\
    \ environmental protection (Yue & Guo 2021). \n \nIn recent years, global climate\
    \ change has caused many irregular and extreme weather events in many parts of\
    \ the world (Li \net al. 2021). As a result of global warming, intense drought,\
    \ severe hurricanes and storms, and extreme floods have begun to be \nexperienced\
    \ intensely in different parts of the world (FAO 2021). In addition, the success\
    \ of crop and animal production varies \ndepending on the short and long-term\
    \ complex environmental effects of global warming and climate change (Hatfield\
    \ et al. \n2011). In many places of the world, plants are negatively affecting\
    \ by climate conditions that are very hot or very cold, and wet \nor dry (Hatfield\
    \ et al. 2015; FAO 2019). Rising seed, fertilizer prices and wages, epidemic and\
    \ vegetative diseases, trade wars, \nflash floods, heatwaves, and other weather\
    \ changes negatively affect agriculture. To meet these challenges and meet the\
    \ demands \nof the future, countries need to develop policies and programs in\
    \ a sustainable way. \n \nIn a report published by UNECE (2021), it was emphasized\
    \ that demographic, economic, social, and climatic changes, were \nall exerting\
    \ increasing pressure on natural resources, including through a seemingly ever-growing\
    \ global demand for energy, \nfood, and water that threatens the ecosystems. As\
    \ a solution, the key to shifting towards sustainable development was highlighted\
    \ \nthat lies in the strategic decisions to be taken regarding natural resources,\
    \ which need to be better valued and more responsibly \nmanaged. \n \nAmong literature\
    \ studies reviewed, no article has been found that analyzes in view of systematic\
    \ and holistic related to digital \ntransition and transformation for a sustainable\
    \ future in agriculture. Most of the literature focuses on individual integration\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 technologies and their applications in different sectors.\
    \ This review aims to close the study gap with a systematic \napproach, analyzing\
    \ digital technologies in agriculture for a sustainable future based on “Energy-Water-Food”\
    \ Nexus. \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives\
    \ the development roadmap of industrial revolutions and \nagricultural revolutions.\
    \ Section 3 introduces sustainable food and agriculture, water-energy-food nexus,\
    \ and digital \ntransformation concepts. Section 4 discusses precision agriculture\
    \ and Agriculture 4.0 topics under the smart farming heading, \ncovering novel\
    \ technologies, digital transition and challenges. Section 5 introduces renewable\
    \ energy and environmental \ntechnologies, new combined solutions; and discussion\
    \ and conclusions are presented in the 6th and 7th sections, respectively. \n\
    \ \n2. Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions \n \nThe expression Industry 4.0\
    \ was used to point out new tsunami of technological progress that was defined\
    \ in 2015 by Schwab \nas the “fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab 2015). While\
    \ the first industrial revolution in the 18th century was characterized \nby transition\
    \ from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy, the second industrial\
    \ revolution covered from water and \nsteam power to electric power (Adebanjo\
    \ et al. 2020). \n \nThe evolution of agriculture, from the primitive level to\
    \ the advanced level of today, took place gradually over time. Figure \n1 shows\
    \ together schematic timelines of both industrial revolutions and agricultural\
    \ revolutions. Technological developments in \nagriculture are divided into 4\
    \ long-term and named the transformation from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          375 \n \n \n \nFigure 1-\
    \ Time lines of industrial revolutions and agricultural revolutions (Liu et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nPeriod that is conventional agriculture practices from antique ages\
    \ when farmers mostly used domestic hand tools for \ncultivation mainly relying\
    \ on manpower and animal forces to the end of the 19th century is accepted as\
    \ Agriculture 1.0. \n \nAgriculture 2.0 is referred as the period that is the\
    \ increase food production and reduce hand jobs between 1784 and almost \n1870,\
    \ when agricultural machinery was used for soil tillage, sowing, weeding, irrigation,\
    \ and harvesting (Liu et al. 2021). \n \nAfter passing from the main steam power\
    \ to oil and gas power, the industry 2.0 period of the 20th century started. Due\
    \ to \ndevelopments in the energy and transportation sectors, agricultural products\
    \ were started shipping to long distances. Resulting, \nfar communities connected\
    \ together and new agriculture markets emerged that farmers can sell their produce\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nThe first assembly line that significantly increased efficiency\
    \ and productivity was set up for mass production (Zhai et al. 2020). \nThe first\
    \ agricultural mass production was applied to meat production in livestock. All\
    \ these developments provided making for \nlarge-scale intensive animal farming.\
    \ \n \n“The Green Revolution” era, namely Agriculture 2.0, is the phase of farming\
    \ that began in the late 1950s when new agronomic \nmanagement practices, new\
    \ synthetic pesticides, and fertilizers were used in agricultural fields and various\
    \ machines were \nmanually operated by farmers (Zambon et al. 2019). Thus, yields,\
    \ productivity, and returns increased at all levels (CEMA 2017a). \nAlthough increased\
    \ productivity and improved efficiency were achieved thanks to mechanization,\
    \ all of them, overconsumption \nof fossil fuels, water, and chemicals caused\
    \ the destruction of the environment. Indeed, still today, mankind continues the\
    \ \ndevastations with effects so great that it changes the climate in many parts\
    \ of the world.  Furthermore, the first programmable \nlogic controller (PLC)\
    \ was used in industry in 1969, depending on electronics and on information technology\
    \ (Yülek 2018). \n \nAgriculture 3.0, called also \"Precision Farming\" emerged\
    \ thanks to advances carried out on computing and electronics. These \ndevelopments\
    \ provided saving on energy in machinery use of and saving on the water in irrigation,\
    \ and reducing in use of \nchemicals in the field and, thanks to increasing operational\
    \ performance of agricultural systems (Ahmad & Nabi 2021). \nAccording to the\
    \ definition of the International Society of Precision Agriculture (PA), “Precision\
    \ Agriculture is a management \nstrategy that gathers, processes, and analyses\
    \ temporal, spatial, and individual data and combines it with other information\
    \ to \nguide site, plant, or animal-specific management decisions to improve resource\
    \ efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and \nsustainability of agricultural\
    \ production.” (ISPA 2021). \n \nAlthough agriculture has been affected from every\
    \ era of industrial revolutions, it should be noted the digital transformation\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector started with PA. Today, the agricultural sector\
    \ is experiencing a new revolution, called Agriculture 4.0 \nfrom with the affecting\
    \ of digital technologies also in \"Industry 4.0\" entered our life in 2011. \
    \ \n \n3. Sustainability for Future  \n \n \nUnited Nations (UNs) called for a\
    \ universal action plan related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted\
    \ on 25 \nSeptember 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives\
    \ of everyone, everywhere. The 17 goals are part of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable\
    \ Development. This agenda sets out a 15-year (2016-2030) plan to achieve the\
    \ goals. These were \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n376 \n \nplanned to help measure\
    \ progress in each of the 193 countries that agreed to work towards achieving\
    \ the goals. SDGs 17 targets \nare illustrated holistically in Figure 2 (United\
    \ Nations 2015).   \n \nAs highlighted in report prepared by The World in 2050\
    \ initiative, governments that signed the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable \nDevelopment\
    \ Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are calling for profound\
    \ transformations that will \nrequire complementary actions from civil society,\
    \ science and business (TWI2050 2018). \n \n \n \nFigure 2- Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals numbered according to icons accepted by United Nations (United Nations\
    \ 2015) \n \nSetting off to carry out the activities in The World in 2050 initiative,\
    \ Sachs et al. (2019) presented six SDG transformations \nto achieve SDG targets.\
    \ Among which, Transformation 4 has taken attention as one of the key parts covering\
    \ sustainable food, \nland, water, and oceans. Transformation 6 covers the digital\
    \ revolution for sustainable development comes forward as a foremost \nforce that\
    \ makes a difference, also it has been also pointed out as the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution. \n \nIn Trends in Biotechnology published in 2021, it emphasized\
    \ that biotechnology to be coupled with digital technologies will \nplay a key\
    \ role in transforming current land-use systems in the future (Goh et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n3.1. Sustainable food and agriculture  \n \nThe FAO has established five\
    \ basic principles that will provide to become increasingly productive and sustainable,\
    \ building a \nproduction system that works in favour of the ecosystem, satisfying\
    \ human needs to achieve 2030 SDG targets. FAO’s five basic \nprinciples are:\
    \ (1) Increasing productivity, employment, and value addition in food systems,\
    \ (2) Protecting and enhancing natural \nresources, (3) Improving livelihoods\
    \ and fostering inclusive economic growth, (4) Enhancing the resilience of people,\
    \ \ncommunities, and ecosystems, and (5) Adapting governance to new challenges\
    \ (FAO 2018). \n \nMoreover, the 20 practical and interconnected actions integrated\
    \ by FAO (2018) are prepared for decision-makers to provide \ntransformations\
    \ related to the 2030 Agenda SDGs. \n \nThe 2030 SDGs comprise the aims related\
    \ to food (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), climate change (SDG 13), and\
    \ \necosystem (SDG 15). Policies and programs managers to be developed by managers\
    \ will sign managing of resources in future \nin the way a more sustainable one.\
    \ Nevertheless, there are many operational difficulties. Holistic systematic analyses\
    \ are needed \nto obtain comprehensive solutions covering problems related to\
    \ the water-energy-food-climate. Future farming will be built on \nfour main pillars\
    \ are follows (1) Improving productivity, (2) Rational use of resources, (3) Adaptation\
    \ to climate change, and (4) \nAvoidance of food waste (FAO 2018). \n \n3.2. Water-Energy-Food\
    \ Nexus \n \nEnergy, water and food security have been identified as three of\
    \ the key resources in achieving the United Nations' sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (Babatunde et al. 2019). Therefore, the water-energy-food nexus has been\
    \ proposed as a conceptual tool for \nachieving sustainable development. Many\
    \ developing countries has faced many challenges to meet the demands increasing\
    \ for \nhealthy food, clean water and green energy due to the climate change.\
    \ An effective solution can only be achieved through \nsustainable use of vital\
    \ resources such as land, water, and energy (Rasul & Sharma 2016). \n \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          377 \n \nWater, energy, and food are resources that\
    \ are unavoidably connected with each other. Impacts on only one resource can\
    \ also \ncause changes in the other ones. The increasing global population, energy\
    \ demands, freshwater resources, and food supply \nemphasize the significance\
    \ of this topic. The Water-Food-Energy (WEF) Nexus concept was introduced by Hoff\
    \ in the World \nEconomic Forum held in the Bonn in 2011 to take measures pointing\
    \ out the problems the world may face and to address the \nlinks between water\
    \ and economic development (Hoﬀ 2011). In recent years, the WEF nexus has become\
    \ an independent \ntechnical term due to its growing popularity. The interdependent\
    \ and complex interactions of these three basic resources are \ncalled as the\
    \ water-energy-food nexus (Zhang and Vesselinov 2016; Bieber et al. 2018). Solutions\
    \ of challenges concerning food, \nwater, and energy have to be planned to meet\
    \ current and future socio-economic demands at local, regional, national, and\
    \ global \nscales for sustainable development (Bazilian et al. 2011; FAO 2014;\
    \ Howells et al. 2013; IRENA 2015; Cevher 2019; Namany \net al. 2021). Figure\
    \ 3 shows connections water-energy-food nexus, interactions among WEF. \n \nThere\
    \ are technological solutions based on nexus models for rural and urban fields\
    \ (Lehmann 2018), sensor applications \n(Abegaz et al. 2018), renewable energy\
    \ (IRENA 2015), and greenhouse monitoring (Asolkar & Bhadade 2015). Moreover,\
    \ if \nknowing the interconnections between the three elements of the Nexus, it\
    \ can be determined which resource should be shared in \nwhat proportion for sustainable\
    \ production, how taking temporal and spatial strategical decisions. (Tian et\
    \ al. 2018; Zhang et al. \n2018; Ravar et al. 2020, Norouzi & Kalantari 2020;\
    \ Keyhanpour et al. 2021; Yue et al. 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 3- Water-energy-food\
    \ nexus, interactions among WEF (modified from Bieber 2018). \n \n3.3. Digital\
    \ Transformation  \n \nAccording to FAO and World Bank reports, digital transformation\
    \ can be used to solve challenges that are faced in agriculture \nand in rural\
    \ areas (WB 2019; Trendov et al. 2019). Thanks to a well-planned transition towards\
    \ smart farming (Klerkx & Rose \n2020), this transformation can contribute to\
    \ agri-food systems (Klerkx and Begemann 2020). Digital transformation is a concept\
    \ \nthat defines the process of finding solutions to social and sectoral needs\
    \ with the integration of digital technologies, and \naccordingly the development\
    \ and change of workflows and culture (ElMassaha & Mohieldin 2020). Digitalization\
    \ is defined as \nthe socio-technical process providing with using digital innovations.\
    \ In the agricultural sector, numerous notions have emerged \nto define different\
    \ forms of digitalization in agri-food production systems (Klerkx et al. 2019).\
    \  \n \nThese are Precision Farming (McBratney et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2012;\
    \ Eastwood et al. 2017), Smart Farming (Wolfert et \nal. 2017), Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Rose & Chilvers 2018; De Clercq et al. 2018; Zambon et al. 2019; Zhai et al.\
    \ 2020; Raj et al. 2021; \nRijswijk et al. 2021; Rose et al. 2021). Moreover,\
    \ synonyms of Agriculture 4.0 are “Numerical Agriculture” (Agriculture \nNumérique)\
    \ in France (Klerkx et al. 2019), “Smart Farming” in many countries of the European\
    \ Union, “Digital Agriculture” in \nAustralia and New Zealand (Keogh & Henry 2016;\
    \ Shepherd et al. 2018; Fielke et al. 2020; Fleming et al. 2021). These concepts\
    \ \nhave defined as the \"Digital Agricultural Revolution\" by Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) (Trendov et al. 2019) \n \nAccording to CEMA (2018), Digital\
    \ Farming is the transformation from Precision Farming to end to end connectable,\
    \ \nknowledge-based farm production systems. CEMA explains that Digital Farming\
    \ has a similar structure to Industry 4.0. \nHowever, there are many aspects of\
    \ production parameters in agriculture that are different from industry. Agriculture\
    \ is mostly \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n378 \n \ndefined with environmental and biological\
    \ factors, and therefore its physical specifications should be basically considered\
    \ \n(CEMA 2017a; 2017b). \n \nLioutas et al. (2021) presented the beneficial and\
    \ negative aspects of digitalization. They also indicated the necessity to \n\
    develop new approaches based on science in terms of societal impacts in the evolution\
    \ of digital agriculture. \n \nPylianidis et al. (2021) reported a review on digital\
    \ twins in agriculture in the period 2017-2020. They defined the unique \ncharacteristics\
    \ of agricultural digital twins and pointed out that digitalization will provide\
    \ multiple gains in terms of productivity \nand sustainability to the agricultural\
    \ sector.  \n \nFielke et al. (2019) explained that more comprehensive effects\
    \ due to agricultural innovation and digitalization and pointed \nout that the\
    \ main themes covering socio-technical dimensions of digitalization in agricultural\
    \ production practices are \nconnectivity, transparency, and governance. \n \n\
    Four key technologies that will be an active role in the future of digital farming\
    \ are (1) vision and sensors, (2) automation \nand robotics (3) digitization and\
    \ big data, (4) biological actors. At the heart of all these key technologies\
    \ is the achievement of \nhigh efficiency in connectivity (Berger 2019). \n \n\
    3.3.1. Connectivity \n \nAgricultural digital transformation is one of the topics\
    \ that have political priority on a global scale (WB 2017; WB 2019; Trendov \n\
    et al. 2019). According to the European Commission Report (EC 2017), one of the\
    \ targets of the EU is to connect farmers end \nto end to the digital economy\
    \ to succeed in the sustainable evolving of food and farming.  \n \nThe digital\
    \ connectivity in agricultural knowledge networks and agro-food value exchange\
    \ will increase using novel tools \nsuch as digital hardware and software (Fielke\
    \ et al. 2019). As shown in Figure 4, all three of these technologies-sensors,\
    \ robotic \nautomation, and digital data work together and are enabled by adequate\
    \ connectivity as well as advances in edge computing and \nthe cloud. At the heart\
    \ of all these key technologies is the achievement of high efficiency in connectivity\
    \ (Berger 2019). \n \n \n \nFigure 4- Four key technology levers to drive improvements\
    \ to the farm economy and shape a new agricultural \necosystem - Agricultural\
    \ industry technology map (Berger 2019) \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          379 \n\
    \ \n3.3.2. Transparency \n \nTransparency in agricultural practices is important\
    \ for all stakeholders in the agricultural sector including consumers, and \n\
    regulators, in terms of deep connectivity and informational interaction between\
    \ them (Fielke et al. 2019). Agricultural knowledge \nand advice networks digitalized\
    \ will be crucial in terms of the transformation of agricultural innovation (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \nDigital information flows transfer with transparency to everywhere\
    \ will provide trust between farmers themselves and \ninteractions with technologies\
    \ (Kelton et al. 2008; Sligo & Massey 2007). Transparency is need due to providing\
    \ informational \ninteraction with extensive connectivity between them (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \n \n3.3.3. Governance \n \nIt is known that challenges appear\
    \ in balancing the priorities in terms of sustainable development in the agriculture\
    \ sector as \nagri-food systems digitalize. In order to solve these, planning\
    \ between public and private organizations will require (Carolan \n2018; Regan\
    \ 2019), considering socio-ethical factors to meet public and private goals in\
    \ the agricultural sector (Fielke et al. \n2019). Past experiences in agricultural\
    \ decision support systems have seen that without the contributions of all stakeholders\
    \ in \nthe agricultural sector including social systems it will not be a sufficient\
    \ solution (Fielke et al. 2018; Klerkx et al. 2017). \n \n4. Smart Farming \n\
    \ \nImprovements in both hardware and software technology open a new chapter in\
    \ agriculture, especially when it comes to sensors, \nbiologicals, robotic & automation,\
    \ and digital data. PA is a part of smart farming technologies including agricultural\
    \ \nmanagement, information systems, and automation and robotics (Balafoutis et\
    \ al. 2020; Klerkx et al. 2019; Rose & Chilvers \n2018). \n \n4.1. Precision Agriculture\
    \  \n \nPA is the management of spatial and temporal variability through using\
    \ advanced technologies to precisely match agricultural \ninputs to increase economic\
    \ gains and lessen environmental impacts. \n \nPA not only offers solutions to\
    \ address many of the problems posed, exacerbated and exposed by this global crisis,\
    \ it also \nhas the potential to be an invaluable tool for rebuilding and strengthening\
    \ the efficient and sustainable food systems of tomorrow. \nPrior to PA, farmers\
    \ homogeneously managed their inputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide and irrigation\
    \ despite existing within-\nfield variability in soil properties, crop stress\
    \ and crop yield. Beginning in the 1990s, after the emergence of PA, farmers were\
    \ \nable to divide their heterogeneous areas into smaller units that were relatively\
    \ homogeneous. Knowing all the historical data of \nan area can help growers adopt\
    \ a PA approach and adjust their input to benefit their land, increase profitability\
    \ and reduce their \noverall environmental impact. PA offers the use of satellite\
    \ technologies that allow real-time management of crops, fields and \nanimals\
    \ (Talepbour et al. 2015).  \n \nIn the light of the developments it has shown\
    \ from the emergence of PA to the present day, it develops agricultural \nmanagement\
    \ by making use of various perspectives. These perspectives are listed below.\
    \ \n \na) Agronomic perspective: considering the real needs of the crop in the\
    \ regulation of cultural practices (for example; better \nfertilization management).\
    \ \nb) Technical perspective: establishing better time management at farm level\
    \ (for example; planning of agricultural activities). \nc) Environmental perspective:\
    \ reducing agricultural effects (to more accurately estimate the soil's need for\
    \ nitrogen to limit \nnitrogen flow). \nd) Economic perspective: increasing productivity\
    \ or reducing the amount of input, increasing the efficiency of the yield (for\
    \ \nexample; making nitrogen fertilization application at low cost). \n \nRecently,\
    \ various technologies related to PA have developed technologies like GPS systems,\
    \ yield mapping, smart sensors, \nand automatic steering systems. As expected,\
    \ these systems were developed for the farmer to increase yields, save nutrients\
    \ and \nso as to make efficient sensing and decision support systems that can\
    \ increase profitability on the farm and reduce negative \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ PA supports reduced tillage and other cost and labor-saving novel technologies.\
    \ Along with the latest \ndevelopments in semi-autonomous systems and agricultural\
    \ robots in this process, it seems that the process has accelerated \namong farmers.\
    \ Figure 5 shows the connections between different technical systems and sensors,\
    \ especially from geolocation \nand sensing systems to decision support, variable-rate\
    \ operation, and route planning among emerging technologies in PA \n(Pedersen\
    \ 2017). \n \nFrontier technologies used in PA for long time have four main phases\
    \ that span almost all agricultural applications. These \nfour main stages and\
    \ related technologies (Balafoutis et al. 2020); \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    380 \n \n1. Guidance technologies- These include all types of automatic guidance\
    \ for tractors and self-propelled agricultural \nmachinery such as driver assistance,\
    \ controlled traffic in agriculture, developed based on hardware and software.\
    \ \n2. Information management- Measurement is essential for accurate farming and\
    \ better control results. Measurement systems \nconsist of sensors that can be\
    \ mounted on ground-based stations and attached to aerial or satellite platforms.\
    \ They collect \nspatial information including soil mapping, canopy mapping, and\
    \ yield mapping, also soil moisture mapping. Knowledge \nmanagement will enable\
    \ farmers to perform PA more efficiently and comfortably. If the connection between\
    \ the digital \nand the physical farm is not made right, there can always be a\
    \ shortage of precision farming among farmers. \n3. Application technologies-\
    \ These involve technologies such as variable rate irrigation and variable rate\
    \ application \ntechnologies for nutrients, crop protection agents, irrigation,\
    \ seeding, and precision weed control, developed based on \nhardware and software.\
    \ \n4. Data analysis technologies- These are used for the analysis of data gathered\
    \ through data collection. Related technologies \nare: \n \n- Management zone\
    \ definition \n- Decision support systems (DSS) \n- Farm management information\
    \ systems (FMS) \n \n \n \nFigure 5- Major digital systems used in precision agriculture\
    \ (Pedersen 2017) \n \nInternational experiences and survey studies show that\
    \ Aided Steering Systems (ASS) tend to be the first technologies \nadopted by\
    \ farmers, due to their relative simplicity and the tangible benefits in terms\
    \ of reduced fuel consumption and inputs as \nwell as increased labour productivity\
    \ (less driver fatigue, working during night, etc.) (Say et al. 2017). Recording\
    \ technologies \nare increasingly available through remote sensing from satellites\
    \ and drones even though their use by individual farmers is still \nlimited. Field\
    \ sensors are increasingly being deployed in higher value crops such as orchards\
    \ and vegetables but also in field \ncrops, to support irrigation management and\
    \ for early warning of diseases. Reacting technologies such as VRAs (Variable\
    \ Rate \nApplications) are being adopted more slowly, as they are most complex\
    \ requiring proper recording technologies as well as \nsufficient intra-field\
    \ heterogeneity to be profitable for farmers. Evidence in Turkey suggests a similar\
    \ pattern: As such, farmers \nare less convinced about their profitability and\
    \ require more sensitization, training and support (Say et al. 2017). \n \nSatellite\
    \ technology has also shown significant progress for imaging applications among\
    \ PA technologies. For example, \nremote sensing (RS) is used successfully to\
    \ detect variability in soil and crop conditions and to match inputs such as water,\
    \ seed, \nand fertilizer via variable rate technology. Currently, satellite imaging\
    \ technology is more suitable for large areas due to its cost \neffectiveness\
    \ in comparison to drone-based imaging. However, with a number of high-precision\
    \ satellite launches being planned, \nthat precision capabilities will improve\
    \ significantly to enable usage for medium-sized and small fields. \n \nDrone-based\
    \ imaging in PA has evolved rapidly over the last few years. Current drone imaging\
    \ favours usage of smaller \nfarms where satellite imagery is not cost effective.\
    \ With the improvements in satellite technology described above, however, \ndrone-based\
    \ imaging may be limited to certain conditions such as heavy cloud cover or difficult\
    \ terrain. With regards to precision \nspraying, however, drones may prove to\
    \ be a significant advantage as payload capacity continues to increase. \n \n\
    Lastly, farm management systems are another interesting and developing area in\
    \ the PA ecosystem. They assist farmers and \nland managers in achieving higher\
    \ yields and less waste through smarter resource management and greater reduction\
    \ of input \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          381 \n \ncosts. Current farm management\
    \ systems use predictive algorithms to issue warnings on imminent pest attacks\
    \ and other key \nrisks affecting farm productivity. \n \n4.2. Agriculture 4.0\
    \  \n \nThe agricultural sector sets sail towards a new era of agriculture called\
    \ “Agriculture 4.0” thanks to emerging novel digital \ntechnologies. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 finds solution to agricultural and environmental problems thanks to digitalization,\
    \ automation, and \nartificial intelligence adjusted to various agricultural technologies\
    \ from crop and livestock production, to weeding, to pest control, \nand also\
    \ to harvest.  \n \nMost studies related to new digital technologies are carried\
    \ out on topics, such as Information and Communications \nTechnologies (ICT),\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC) Big Data Analytics (BDA), robotics,\
    \ Machine Learning \n(ML), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles \n(UGVs), and Blockchain. There\
    \ are many literatures covering various applications used in Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ the past few years:  \nICT (Lezoche et al. 2020; Moysiadis et al. 2021); WSN\
    \ (Ojha et al. 2015; Kochhar & Kumar 2019), IoT (Sinha & Dhanalakshmi \n2022;\
    \ Zhang et al. 2021; Sadowski & Spachos. 2020; Lin et al. 2020; Tzounis et al.\

    \ 2020; Marolia et al. 2021; Tao et al. 2021), Big Data (Newton et al. 2020; Lezoche\
    \ et al. 2020; \nMoysiadis et al. 2021; Wolfert et al. 2017), UAV technology (Moysiadis\
    \ et al. 2021; Kim et al. 2018; Boursianis et al. 2020), \nand Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (Moysiadis et al. 2021; Jha et al. 2019), Machine Learning (Moysiadis et al.\
    \ 2021; Liakos et al. 2018), \nBlockchain (Chen et al. 2020; Bera et al. 2022;\
    \ GHD and AgThentic 2018), Automation & Robotics (Aceto et al. 2019; Carolan \n\
    2019). Furthermore, other smart farming topics including 3D Printing, Synthetic\
    \ Biology, Gene Editing, Nano Materials have \nbeen researched by GHD & AgThentic\
    \ (2018). \n \nNonetheless, Agriculture 4.0 paradigm occurs five core technologies\
    \ covering sensors and robotics, Internet of Things, cloud \ncomputing, data analytics,\
    \ decision support system. Figure 6 shows core technologies and connections among\
    \ them. (1) Sensors \nand robotics fulfill sensing and actuating functions, according\
    \ to the needs of the system. (2) IoT provides connectivity based on \nprotocol\
    \ and network for data communication. (3) Cloud computing is responsible for data\
    \ storage and processing. (4) Data \nanalytics involves big data and AI and ML-based\
    \ algorithms for data analysis. (5) Decision support system helps to provide data\
    \ \nvisualization, guidance functions, and user interaction (Araújo et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 6- Agriculture 4.0 core technologies and connections (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021) \n \n4.2.1. Novel digital technologies \n \nIndustry 4.0 has the\
    \ potential to transform the production capabilities of whole industries, including\
    \ the agricultural fields. \nConnectivity is the cornerstone of this transformation\
    \ and IoT is a key enabling technology that is increasingly part of agricultural\
    \ \nequipment. Technologies, such as IoT, Edge Computing, AI, robotics, 5G, blockchain,\
    \ and supercomputing, all have the potential \nto make agriculture more efficient,\
    \ sustainable, and competitive. Some definitions related to the advanced digital\
    \ technologies \ngiven by European Commission are following (EC 2021a): \n \n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of smart, interconnected devices\
    \ and services that are capable of sensing \nor even listening to requests. IoT\
    \ is an aggregation of endpoints that are uniquely identifiable and that communicate\
    \ bi-\ndirectionally over a network using some form of automated connectivity.\
    \ The IoT enables based on networked sensors to \nremotely connect, track and\
    \ manage products, systems, and grids. \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n382 \n \nCloud computing\
    \ includes the use of tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases,\
    \ and software based on \na network of remote servers through the Internet. Cloud\
    \ computing services enable users to store files and applications in a \nvirtual\
    \ place or the cloud and access all the data via the Internet. Public cloud services\
    \ are available on public networks and open \nto a widely unlimited cosmos of\
    \ potential users, designed for a market, not a single enterprise. \n \nBig Data\
    \ is a term describing the continuous increase in data, and the technologies needed\
    \ to collect, store, manage and \nanalyze it. It is a complex and multidimensional\
    \ phenomenon, impacting people, processes, and technology. Big Data is usually\
    \ \ncharacterized by \"four Vs \": Volume (size of the data sets), Velocity (high\
    \ speed of data processing), Variety (different types \nand sources of data used),\
    \ and Veracity (high quality of analyzed data). \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a term used to define machines achieving human-like cognitive functions such\
    \ as learning, \nunderstanding, reasoning, or interacting. It comprises different\
    \ forms of cognition and meaning understanding (e.g. Speech \nrecognition, Natural\
    \ Language processing) and human interaction (e.g. signal sensing, smart control,\
    \ simulators). In terms of its \ntechnology base AI is a very heterogeneous field.\
    \ While some aspects like sensors, chips, robots as well as certain applications\
    \ \nlike autonomous driving, logistics, or medical instruments refer to hardware\
    \ components, a relevant part of AI is rooted in \nalgorithms and software.  \n\
    \ \nAgricultural robots can be used for crop monitoring and plant phenotyping,\
    \ yield estimation, soil sampling, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, dairy milking,\
    \ sorting tasks, disease detection, weed and pest control, planting, harvesting,\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring and pruning. UAVs and UGVs are robots that are used\
    \ both in the air and on land for agricultural applications. \n \nBlockchain is\
    \ a shared, digital, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording\
    \ transactions and tracking assets in \na business network. Shared ledgers technology\
    \ allows new transactions to be added to an existing chain of transactions using\
    \ a \nsecure, digital or cryptographic signature. Assets can be tangible (house,\
    \ car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, \npatents, copyrights,\
    \ brand). Blockchain protocols aggregate, validate, and relay transactions within\
    \ the blockchain network. \nAlmost anything of value can be tracked and transacted\
    \ on a blockchain network, reducing risk and reducing all costs involved \nin\
    \ the business. Blockchain is ideal for presenting information as it provides\
    \ instantaneous, shared, and completely transparent \ninformation stored in a\
    \ non-modifiable ledger that can only be accessed by authorized network members.\
    \ A blockchain network \ncan track orders, payments, accounts, production, and\
    \ much more. As members share a single view of the truth, all the details of \n\
    a transaction can be seen from start to finish; thus, creating new efficiencies\
    \ and opportunities as well as greater confidence.  \n \nIndustrial Biotechnology\
    \ is the application domain of biotechnology for the industry in the production\
    \ and processing of \nchemicals, materials, and fuels. This technology involves\
    \ the practices related to using microorganisms or enzymes to generate \nindustrially\
    \ useful products in a more efficient way (e.g. less energy use, or fewer by-products)\
    \ without conventional \npetrochemical processes. \n \nNanotechnology is an umbrella\
    \ term that covers from the design to structural application and production, to\
    \ devices, and \nsystems by controlling shape and size at a nanometer scale. Nanotechnology\
    \ has revolutionary the potential for the development \nof smart nano and micro-devices\
    \ and systems in fields such as agriculture, healthcare, energy, environment,\
    \ and manufacturing. \nNanotechnology use in agriculture allows smart solutions\
    \ for nutrients, pesticides, and genetic materials for improved soil \nfertility\
    \ and soil protection, thanks to better stress tolerance. Nano-based sensors can\
    \ be used for monitoring whole factors that \naffect productivity in smart farming.\
    \ Moreover, nanotechnology can be used in post-harvest food processing and packaging\
    \ to \nreduce food contamination and waste. \n \nPhotonics is a multidisciplinary\
    \ field related to light including energy generation, detection, and process management,\
    \ \ndevices such as electronic components, and photodiodes, lasers, and LEDs.\
    \ It allows the technological basis for the economic \nconversion of sunlight\
    \ to electricity for solar-powered systems. \n \n4.2.2. Agriculture 4.0 applications\
    \ \n \nAgriculture 4.0 can be applied at four main groups as showed in Figure\
    \ 7: (a) monitoring; (b) control, (c) prediction, and (d) \nlogistics (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          383 \n \n \n \nFigure 7-\
    \ Domains and applications in Agriculture 4.0 (Araújo et al. 2021) \n \nMonitoring-\
    \ Automatic monitoring is the first step to passing to Agriculture 4.0. Smart\
    \ monitoring systems have potential \nchanging the game rule thanks to real-time\
    \ data collected from the field and advanced data analytics tools providing the\
    \ success \nof agricultural management. Monitoring allows farmers to get smart\
    \ and fast decisions and perform timely interventions, to \nincrease productivity\
    \ in agriculture, save time and costs and protect the environment (Araújo et al.\
    \ 2021). \n \nMonitoring include usually applications as follows: \n \n- Weather\
    \ monitoring (air temperature and humidity, rainfall, wind direction, wind velocity,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, solar \nradiation, etc.).  \n- GHG monitoring (temperature,\
    \ GHG emissions- CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2).  \n- Crop monitoring (NDVI) and soil monitoring\
    \ (temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity, pH value, and nutrient content)\
    \ \nfor agricultural management.  \n- Water monitoring (temperature, conductivity,\
    \ pH, salinity, turbidity, specific chemical compounds, dissolved oxygen \ncontent)\
    \ for irrigation systems, aquaculture or aquaponics (aquaculture + hydroponics)\
    \ for management. \n \nControl- While information is managed in one way in the\
    \ monitoring applications, the control applications use a bidirectional \ninformation\
    \ line. Commonly, an IoT-control system works together automatic monitoring system,\
    \ which employs IoT sensors \nto collect necessary data and to transfer them for\
    \ storage and then processing. Control applications are the following (Araújo\
    \ et \nal. 2021): \n \n- Irrigation Systems (sensors, actuators such as water\
    \ pumps, and solenoid valves) for irrigation management.  \n- Fertilization and\
    \ Fertigation for optimum fertilization. \n- Weed, Pest and Disease Control for\
    \ many problems like a waste of chemicals, increased costs, and pest resistance\
    \ to \nchemicals, environmental pollution, and contamination of agricultural products.\
    \ \n \nPrediction- Predicting function in Agriculture 4.0 is used in decision-making\
    \ support for the optimization in the management \nprocess. Monitoring and documentation\
    \ are vital processes since it is used real-time and historical data to improve\
    \ exact \nanalytical methods in predicting actual events. Prediction applications\
    \ are the following (Araújo et al. 2021): \n \n- Forecasting Weather Conditions\
    \ \n- Crop Development and Yield Estimation  \n- Forecasting Market Demand \n\
    \ \nLogistics- It is known that, in recent years, consumers have been more concerned\
    \ about how the agri-food products bought \nare produced, handled, packaged, stored,\
    \ and distributed. Agriculture 4.0 provides more efficient management and transparency\
    \ \nby increasing efficiency in logistics, addressing food safety and security,\
    \ traceability and food authentication, decreasing intrinsic \nrisks, and complying\
    \ with certifications and regulations (Araújo et al. 2021). \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nSeveral application examples related to domains such as monitoring, control,\
    \ prediction, and logistics of smart farming are given \nbelow. \n \nSmart Livestock\
    \ Farming (SLF) is one of applications of PA that supports real-time monitoring\
    \ of productions, health, and \nwelfare of livestock, and to ensure optimal yield,\
    \ to increase the management capacity of animals. A variety of sensors and \n\
    actuators and decision-making tools, and IoT technologies are used in SLF (Cadero\
    \ et al. 2018). Electronic identification systems \nsuch as ear tags, ruminal\
    \ boluses, and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors\
    \ like accelerometers, \nglobal positioning systems, and social activity loggers;\
    \ and stationary management systems, milking parlor, and related \ntechnologies\
    \ and flock management software are used in SLF (Vaintrub et al. 2021). Newton\
    \ et al. (2020) examined a case study \nrelated to the dairy milk recording system\
    \ under Australian conditions, using big data analytics based on individual cow\
    \ and herd \nperformance information, such as milk production, lactation, and\
    \ breeding records. They studied farm decision support using big \ndata and explored\
    \ various factors and processes along with farmer engagement. Knight (2020) reviewed\
    \ the current status of \nwearable sensor technologies in livestock farming that\
    \ could revolutionize dairy farming; explained the important difficulties, \n\
    and emphasized the advantages need for animal wellbeing, profitability. Sensors\
    \ are split into three categories: (1) \"At Cow\" \nsensors, (2) \"Near Cow\"\
    \ sensors, and (3) \"From Cow\" sensors. Wearable sensors can be placed by swallowing\
    \ or inserting into \ncows. Figure 8 shows wearable sensor technologies developed\
    \ for cows. While \"At Cow\" sensors at the red zone are used to \nmeasure acceleration,\
    \ temperature, heart rate, and pH, \"Near Cow\" sensors at the blue zone are used\
    \ to analyze video and sound \ninformation, as well as climate analysis, feed\
    \ analysis, and GPS, these are designed to be make interaction with the cloud.\
    \ \"From \nCow\" sensors at the green zone are employed to monitor products and\
    \ wastes like milk, hair, saliva, sweat, nasal secretion, \nbreath, and faeces\
    \ taken from the cow. Zhang et al. (2021) pointed out that SLF has important potential\
    \ thanks to intelligent \ntechnologies such as environmental control, disease\
    \ early warning, precise feeding, and remote diagnosis. They discussed the \n\
    framework and technical characteristics of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT),\
    \ the advantages, difficulties, and expectations \nof the W-IoT in farm animals\
    \ (Figure 9). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8- Overview of sensor technologies associated\
    \ with dairy animals for cows (modified from Knight 2020) \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker\

    \ 2021) \n \nSmart greenhouses enable farmers to cultivate crops with minimum\
    \ human interference. Climatic conditions such as \ntemperature, humidity, luminosity,\
    \ and soil moisture are continuously monitored inside a greenhouse. Variations\
    \ in these \nconditions will trigger automated actions. These actions will then\
    \ evaluate the changes and implement corrective actions to \nmaintain optimal\
    \ conditions for plant growth. \n \nZamora-Izquierdo et al. (2019) proposed a\
    \ flexible platform for greenhouses that used soilless culture with full recirculation.\
    \ \nThe system that obtained saving of more than 30% in water consumption and\
    \ up to 80% in some nutrients has low-cost hardware \nand a three-tier open-source\
    \ software platform at local, edge, and cloud planes.   \n \nLiao et al. (2017)\
    \ developed an IoT-based system including three subsystems like environmental\
    \ monitoring system, a \nwireless imaging platform, and a host analysis platform,\
    \ shown in Figure 10. In an orchid greenhouse, environmental sensors \nthat measure\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, and cameras capture the images\
    \ of orchids were used. The IoT-\nbased environmental monitoring system consists\
    \ of 12 WSN, and a gateway based on ZigBee. While WSNs are responsible for \n\
    measuring environmental parameters, the gateway is used to organize the sensor\
    \ readings sent by the WSNs and transmit them \nto the host via Wi-Fi. The IoT-based\
    \ wireless imaging platform is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer\
    \ with cameras. \nSensor data and camera images are saved in the host platform.\

    \ (2020) developed a framework using a linear programming model maximizing economic\
    \ profits and environmental \nbenefits for the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization\
    \ system in which both long-term and short-term planning are considered as \n\
    illustrated in Figure 11. \n \n \n \nFigure 11- IoT-based smart fertigation management\
    \ system (Lin et al. 2020) \n \nRoy et al. (2021) designed an IoT system according\
    \ to a dynamic irrigation scheduling called \"AgriSens\" for efficient water \n\
    management of irrigated crop fields. The AgriSens enables real-time, automatic\
    \ irrigation, as well as remote manual irrigation \nfor different growth phases.\
    \ IoT helps not only enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes but also minimize\
    \ water losses. In \norder to calculate the precise needs for water, sensors that\
    \ measure various parameters, such as relative humidity, soil moisture, \ntemperature,\
    \ and light intensity, need. IoT-based smart irrigation systems with such a mechanism\
    \ can contribute to higher \nirrigation efficiency. Benyezza et al. (2021) proposed\
    \ a block diagram of the example irrigation system, which is composed of \nthree\
    \ main parts, as shown in Figure 12: data processing, cloud, and communication\

    \ initiate the digitization of agriculture in Europe with \napproximately €1 billion\
    \ of EU funding under the Horizon 2020 program (EC 2021b). Several examples of\
    \ these projects are \ngiven below: \n \nATLAS project is agricultural interoperability\

    \ \napplications. The goal of ATLAS is the development of an open interoperability\
    \ network for agricultural applications and to \nbuild up a sustainable ecosystem\
    \ for innovative data-driven agriculture. The platform enables the flexible combination\
    \ of \nagricultural machinery, sensor systems, and data analysis tools to overcome\
    \ the lack of interoperability. This allows farmers to \nincrease their productivity\
    \ in a sustainable way. The ATLAS platform is built around a data exchange network\

    \ in the European food and farming industry both precision farming \nand smart\
    \ farming (IoF2020 2017). IoT-driven smart farming enables farmers to optimize\
    \ their operating tasks to boost crop \nyields and to reduce the costs of inputs\
    \ such as water, fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.  \n \nDEMETER project\
    \ is a large-scale deployment of farmer-driven, interoperable smart farming-IoT\

    \ across the value chain (demand and supply), with 25 deployment sites, 6000 farmers\
    \ and over 38000 devices and \nsensors being deployed (DEMETER 2019). \n \nSome\
    \ of EU’s robotics projects are Vinbot, MARS, GRAPE, VINEROBOT, ROMI and Flourish\
    \ projects (Moysiadis et al. \n2021). Vinbot aimed operations crop monitoring\
    \ using devices like laser sensors, cameras and the navigation system that is\
    \ based \non a hybrid reactive/GPS (VINBOT 2017). MARS subproject was designed\
    \ for the development of a mobile agricultural robot, \nwhich had the ability\
    \ to cooperate and work in swarms (Figure 14a). GRAPE subproject targeted to develop\
    \ a UGV able to \nperform semi-autonomous vineyard monitoring and farming tasks\
    \ (Figure 14b). VINEROBOT aimed to develop a novel UGV \ncapable of monitoring\
    \ grape growth and factors like grape yield, vegetative growth, water stress,\
    \ and grape composition in \ncovering vineyard management (Figure 14c). ROMI project\
    \ is developed for a UGV performing tasks such as weeding, crop \nmonitoring,\

    \ that the success of Agriculture 4.0 could lead, there are still various challenges\
    \ that need to be handled \nfor providing a successful digital transformation.\
    \ The main challenges to be considered in Agriculture 4.0 are split into five\
    \ main \nlevels. Those challenges are related to device, data, network, application,\
    \ and the system according to levels. Challenges at device \nlevels are usually\
    \ related to a harsh field environment, power consumption, and cost issues. Data\
    \ levels are mostly linked to \nquality, availability, privacy, integrity, and\
    \ interpretability issues. Facing at network levels are mostly network size, latency\
    \ and \nthroughput, transmission range, propagation losses, and interoperability\
    \ issues. Emerging of during applications are usually real-\ntime use, context-awareness,\
    \ cyber-security, modularity, and reliability problems. Problems that emerged\
    \ in the system are \nscalability, flexibility, robustness, complexity, affordability,\
    \ and continuous improvement issues (Araújo et al. 2021).  \n \nAs noted earlier\
    \ (besides the small scale of land and low level of mechanization), farmers face\
    \ significant challenges in the \ntransition to smart farming as they try to adopt\
    \ sensors, biologicals, robotic automation, and digital data from third-party\
    \ \nproviders. Farmers are traditionally conservative and adopt new technology\
    \ solely for its usefulness rather than its technological \nappeal. As a result,\
    \ compelling applications must be significantly deep to deal with the farmer's\
    \ specific situation, while also \nrelying on integrated solutions that make data\
    \ and insights easy and seamless. \n \nThere are two basic stages in smart farming\
    \ that should be taken into account for the transition: (1) The pre-processing\
    \ stage \nand (2) the post-processing stage. The pre-processing phase covers market\
    \ trends geographical conditions and soil properties of \nthe land, seeds choosing,\
    \ and the land preparation for the smart farming system. The post-processing stage\
    \ is employed machine \nvision techniques for disease and weed identification\
    \ while using smart technologies in irrigation and harvesting. For traditional\
    \ \nagricultural players, this transition is not easy. As the industry moves from\
    \ products to outcome-based solutions and worksite \noptimization, many organizations\
    \ face the conflict of traditional platform or product-based organizations versus\
    \ the needs of the \nfarmer and marketplace. As a result, smart farming is undergoing\
    \ a rapid transformation from both a product and a service \nperspective. Technological\
    \ disruptions, business model transformations, and organizational changes are\
    \ all creating an exciting \nbut challenging opportunity. \n \n5. Renewable Energy\
    \ and Environmental Technologies \n \nRenewable energy technologies have the potential\
    \ to provide synergy between water, energy, and food; and also, the optimum \n\
    mix is available for three sectors. Solar-based pumping solutions offer a cost-effective\
    \ alternative to the grid- or diesel-based \nirrigation pumps. Renewable energy\
    \ and rainwater harvesting technologies can be combined with a nexus system. Renewable\

    \ energy, wind energy, and bioenergy can be integrated into agriculture in villages\
    \ and cities.  If \ncoupling an energy storage system with renewable energy technologies,\
    \ the excess energy generated can be stored to use in the \nfuture. As an alternative\
    \ solution to the Nexus approach, new applications where photovoltaic panels are\
    \ combined can be used \nin field and horticulture, and aquaculture. \n \n5.1.\
    \ Agrivoltaics  \n \nAgrivoltaic systems are PV technologies installed at a certain\
    \ height from the ground, making it together integrating agriculture \nand solar\
    \ energy. Agrivoltaic systems can provide both preserve agricultural land and\
    \ advantage crop production by increasing \nwater use efficiency and decreasing\
    \ water stress (Agostini et al. 2021; Allardyce et al. 2017). Sun'Agri agrivoltaic\
    \ system driven \nby artificial intelligence in Piolenc provides the vines shaded\
    \ by the pivoting solar panels continue to grow and show a reduced \nneed for\
    \ water thanks to the reduction in evapotranspiration (pv magazine 2020). However,\
    \ these positive attributes need \ncomprehensive environmental and economic analysis\
    \ of agrivoltaic systems. Figure 15 shows various applications of agrivoltaic\
    \ \nsystems.  \n \n \n \nFigure 15- Agrivoltaic systems: (a, b) Agrovoltaics a\

    \ a concept emerged with combining electricity production and aquaculture. AquaPVs\
    \ floating on the \nwater body can lessen water losses preventing evaporation\
    \ by up to 70–85% due to covering the water. The aquavoltaics \ntechnology enables\
    \ electricity to be generated and aquaculture to be carried out in the same area,\
    \ and thus significantly improves \noverall productivity per unit area compared\
    \ to conventional land use. Several projects and studies are carried out to verify\
    \ positive \nand negative aspects in terms of ecosystem and the technical and\
    \ economic feasibility of dual-use in Aquavoltaics (Pringle et al. \n2017, Fraunhofer\
    \ 2021; Solaripedia 2021; PV TECH 2021). Figure 16 shows various applications\
    \ related to aquavoltaic and \nfloatvoltaic systems.  \n \n \n \nFigure 16- Aquavoltaic\

    \ with digital technologies can be used to solve challenges related to \nwater,\
    \ energy, and food including the environment. In this context, topics including\
    \ overall agricultural management can be \nhandled for the environment (water,\
    \ soil, air – whole ecosystem), optimum water use, and efficient energy use. \n\

    \ and any form of life on earth are inevitably dependent on sunlight, and today,\
    \ thanks to modern technologies \nemerging, Sun offers a bigger source with the\
    \ possibility to harness the energy from it all around the year. Not only does\
    \ the \ndevelopment of the crop with energy coming from the sun but supports the\
    \ gathering of precious information about the soil, air, \nwater, and weather\
    \ conditions themselves. \n \nSolar-powered plug-and-play wireless field sensors\
    \ provide farmers with instant access to data on their soil properties and \n\
    crop health. This hardware is a device IoT-based, low-power, long-range, and adaptable\
    \ based on farm size. A farm monitoring \nsystem shown in Figure 17 is a network\
    \ of smart sensors driven by powerful AI-based crop intelligence and farm management\
    \ \nsoftware to aid farmers across the globe with instant access to soil and crop\
    \ health. It is designed to help farmers accomplish \nhigh crop productivity and\
    \ high-profit margins (Solarvibes 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 17- Solar-powered Plug\
    \ & Play Farm Monitoring System (Solarvibes 2021) \n \n5.3.2. Environmental monitoring\
    \ \n \nClimate change is due to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that have\
    \ been greatly affecting agricultural production. The \nside eﬀects of climate\
    \ change result in frequent experiences of droughts, ﬂoods, and extreme weather\
    \ conditions. Data-driven \nIoT systems are have monitoring and control functions\
    \ including reducing energy and fuel consumption, generating renewable \nenergy\
    \ on-site, and performing closed-loop measurements of carbon consumption and waste.\
    \ It is seen that IoT-powered smart \nservices and industry could account for\
    \ up to 10 percent carbon reduction by increasing efficiency and eliminating reliance\
    \ on \ndisposable materials in both the public and private sectors. \n \nMonitoring\
    \ systems can assist farmers in monitoring and improving the quality to avoid\
    \ degradation of soil. They allow for \nthe monitoring of a number of physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological properties such as texture, water-holding capacity,\
    \ and \nabsorption rate. Soil monitoring can help to minimize problems, such as\
    \ erosion, densification, salinization, acidification, and \npollution due to\
    \ toxic elements (Yurtseven et al. 2018). \n \nPesticides and several other agrochemicals\
    \ are used widely in agriculture. These chemicals that affect in way serious and\
    \ \npermanent ecological balance are harmful to human and animal welfare, causing\
    \ substantial damage to complete ecosystems. \nIoT-based smart devices, such as\
    \ WSNs, drones, robots, enable farmers to substantially decrease the use of pesticides.\
    \ Advanced \nIoT-based pests and insect control allow precise tracking, simulation,\
    \ disease prediction, and therefore is more efficient than \ntraditional pest\
    \ control calendars or prescripts (Raj et al. 2021). The IoT-based systems with\
    \ ML, DL, and image processing can \nbe used in preventing fruit diseases, diagnosing\
    \ and preventing infection in agricultural products. Studies have seen that chemical\
    \ \npollution can prevent using big data, AI, ML technologies. Wastewater from\
    \ industry can be used in agricultural production; \nWater polluted with heavy\
    \ metals threatens our food (paddy, greenhouse cultivation, fish production, etc.)\
    \ and our health. In \nrecent years, it is known that cancer and many diseases\
    \ that adversely affect the immune system are caused by excessive \nagricultural\
    \ spraying and industrial wastewater. Excessive use of pesticides in fields, vineyards,\
    \ gardens, and greenhouses \npollutes air, soil, and water resources. In other\
    \ words, excessive spraying, irrigation, fertilization harm the entire ecosystem\
    \ in \nan unsustainable way. All of this should be traced back to the source where\
    \ the problem started; all data should be forwarded to \nthe center and evaluated;\
    \ monitoring and control mechanisms should be developed. \n \nPA has not only\
    \ the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also having a positive\
    \ effect on-farm productivity and \nthe economy. These technologies cover whole\
    \ farming applications such as variable-rate spraying, irrigation planting, \n\
    fertilization, and weeding (Balofoutis et al. 2017). Both driver assistance (Machine\
    \ Guidance) and Variable Rate Technologies \n(VRT) contribute to climate change\
    \ mitigation by reducing fuel and input use at given yields. Based on a literature\
    \ review, the \nEU classifies GHG reduction potential of different Precision Agricultural\
    \ Technologies (PATs) as it follows (Table 1): \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    \          391 \n \nTable 1- Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction potential of different\

    \ (VRT) \n1 \nWeeding (Precision physical) \n1 \n \nVariable-rate nutrient application\
    \ has the highest GHG emission reduction potential amongst PA technologies, as\
    \ nitrogen \nfertilizer is the main source of N2O that is the most influential\
    \ GHG emitted from farming activities. Its impact on global warming \nis 298 times\
    \ higher than that of CO2 (Soto et al. 2019). Variable-rate irrigation has a dual\
    \ impact. (1) decreasing the energy need \nfor water pumping from the water source,\
    \ (2) reducing of the GHG emissions by applying the optimum irrigation scheduling.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, applications such as controlled traffic in agriculture,\
    \ machine guidance, VRT-pesticide use have GHG \nreduction potential. Moreover,\
    \ all-natural resources (water, air, soil) have threatened due to chemical contaminants,\
    \ \noverwatering, over-spraying, over-fertilizing. \n \n5.3.3. Water monitoring\
    \ \n \nWater Quality Index (WQI) that developed to measure water quality is determined\
    \ through different water quality parameters, \nsuch as pH, turbidity, temperature,\
    \ chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen\
    \ demand \n(BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc. (Ahmed et al. 2020).\
    \ Smart water management requires the integration of \nsystems and a complex of\
    \ measures to monitor, control and regulate the usage and quality of water resources\
    \ as well as maintain \nthe associated equipment (sensors, actuators, pipes, pumps,\
    \ etc.). Smart water systems based on the combination of the IoT, big \ndata,\
    \ and AI technologies can help stop water scarcity from happening and remove the\
    \ damage the incautious usage of water \nresources has already caused. \n \nIn\
    \ rural areas shown in Figure 18, solar-powered wireless air - water - soil monitoring\
    \ stations can be used to monitor \nenvironmental variables at vineyards, orchards,\
    \ fields, fish farms, greenhouses, basis on the energy - food - water nexus at\
    \ real-\ntime. \n \n \n \nFigure 18- Solar-powered wireless-weather-soil-water\

    \ in Africa, a large pivot system with a radius of 479 meters has used to irrigate\
    \ 50 hectares of desert. The fuel costs of \noperating this system are very high.\
    \ Water is being supplied through an artificial canal from the Nile. At this point,\
    \ Alfalfa is \ngrown as feeding hay and harvested 11 times each year with the\
    \ harvest season exceeding 300 days. Until 2013, a 135-kW diesel \ngenerator ran\
    \ 22 hours per day to power the system. An alternative power source had to be\
    \ found in this off-grid. Following \nfeasibility analysis, a solar-powered system,\
    \ using suitable pumps to replace the diesel-powered generator and AC pumps were\
    \ \ninstalled. While all motors required to move the pivot now are powered with\
    \ solar energy, the pivot speed is automatically \ncontrolled proportional to\
    \ water flow. Figure 19 shows solar-powered center pivot irrigation system that\
    \ is installed by Lorentz. \nIn 11 hours, the pivot completes one 360 degrees\
    \ turn, providing the required 3300 m³ of water per day for partial irrigation\
    \ \n(Lorentz 2014). This energy transformation not only no longer decreasing energy\

    \ changing the farming practices from fossil-based energy generation to renewable\
    \ energy based farming. \nRenewable energy technologies to be able to use in farming\
    \ are solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biomass \nenergy. IFES\
    \ is a farming system model designed to combine, intensify, and hence improve\
    \ the simultaneous production of food \nand energy through the sustainable use\
    \ of biomass; achieved in two ways: 1. Combining the production of food and fuel\
    \ feedstock \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\

    \ agroforestry, or agro-pastoral systems, 2. Using the by-products/residues of\
    \ one production \nsystem i.e. ‘closed loop’ or ‘zero waste’ systems. Hence, energy-smart\
    \ solutions can include simultaneously producing food and \nenergy as a means\
    \ of achieving sustainable production systems in rural communities as shown in\
    \ Figure 21 (Sims & Flammini \n2014). \n \n \n \nFigure 21- Integrated food energy\
    \ system (IFES) (Sims & Flammini 2014) \n \n6. Discussion \n \nIn this review,\
    \ innovative digital technologies to be able to use in agri-food systems are discussed\
    \ based on the water-energy-\nfood nexus for sustainable development. The agriculture\
    \ sector has a social-economic structure that is always a risky sector, \nwhere\
    \ variable inputs are used to grow very different products such as food and feed,\
    \ directly affected by weather conditions. \nAgricultural activities, unlike industry,\
    \ are carried out in large, open areas like fields, vineyards, and orchards, or\
    \ closed areas \nlike greenhouses, barns, poultry houses, and mushroom houses.\
    \ Today, it is necessary to switch from labor-intensive production \nto technology-intensive\
    \ production for successful and sustainable agricultural production in all its\
    \ processes.  \n \nSince the areas used in agricultural production are limited,\
    \ a productivity increase in agricultural production should be \nensured. While\
    \ input costs can be reduced, production yield and quality can be increased using\
    \ precision farming (Berger 2019; \nWolfert et al. 2017) and smart farming (Balafoutis\
    \ et al. 2019; Boursianis et al. 2019) technologies with variable rate applications,\
    \ \ndeveloped applications saving the environment. \n \nThe driving factor of\
    \ smart agriculture is to meet the demand for more food to increase yields, optimize\
    \ interdependent \nresources of energy, water, and land, and provide sustainable\
    \ urbanization. Water and energy are two finite resources that must \nreach access\
    \ to more people and so ensuring everyone has access to a reliable supply are\
    \ crucial to human survival and sustainable \ndevelopment (EC 2017; FAO 2017a;\
    \ WB 2019). \n \nThe agri-food value chain consumes 30 percent of the world’s\
    \ available energy (FAO 2020). Energy is needed in the \nproduction of crops,\
    \ fish, livestock, and forestry products, food storage and processing, food transport\
    \ and distribution and, as \nwell as, in food preparation (FAO 2012). Although\
    \ the availability of fossil fuels has made a significant contribution to feeding\
    \ \nthe world, these energy sources are finite and, in general, environmentally\
    \ problematic. As discussed also in this study, renewable \nenergy technologies\
    \ are key to food security and a climate-friendly, sustainable transformation\
    \ of agri-food systems to produce \nmore and better-quality food. Data-driven\
    \ systems, IoT-backed sensors keep an eye on consumption patterns and provide\
    \ insights \ninto inefficient areas which in turn help to analyze energy consumption,\
    \ usage, and pattern. These solutions can be utilized to \nmanage and optimize\
    \ energy consumption patterns by taking complete control of energy data at the\
    \ most fundamental and \ngranular level.  \n \nFAO supports digital technologies,\
    \ innovative ideas with high potential for impact in food and agriculture, for\
    \ transforming \ndigital solutions and services into global public goods. FAO\
    \ aims to explore the responsible application and adoption of existing \nDayıoğlu\

    \ tools and approaches to empower rural households and inspire youth \nentrepreneurship\
    \ in food and agriculture (Santos Valle & Kienzle 2020). \n \nThe farming sector\
    \ is moving towards a new paradigm that is recalled Agriculture 4.0 that integrates\
    \ a number of innovations \nin order to produce agricultural products. Agriculture\
    \ has become a strategic sector that needs to be given more importance due \n\
    to reasons such as climate imbalances caused by global warming, an increase in\
    \ the world population, and the gradual decrease \nof usable agricultural resources.\
    \ Today, when traditional farming methods are no longer sufficient, countries\
    \ have to focus on \npractices that increase productivity and reduce costs with\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 practices. Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is used \nto\
    \ point out the digitalization of production as in Industry 4.0. Indeed, modern\
    \ technology is available that will make agriculture \nmore environmentally friendly\
    \ and efficient. Technical improvements in the agriculture sector can be carried\
    \ out to optimize \nproduction efficiency, and improve quality, minimize carbon\
    \ footprint; and can be reduced production-associated risks. \n \nAgricultural\
    \ applications that are from crop production to harvesting, from weather monitoring\
    \ to prediction, irrigation, \nweeding, fertigation, pest control, and logistics\
    \ are rapidly evolving towards a new digital cosmos covering technologies such\

    \ \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nThis study targets to obtain holistic solutions in\
    \ a systematic view, basis on Water-Energy-Food nexus to agricultural digital\
    \ \ntransformation that will support achieving a sustainable future. Digitalization\
    \ is a technology accessing unexploited data pools \nto valuable information,\
    \ providing transformation to potential benefits for society and the environment\
    \ if programming smartly \nand efficiently among data sets.  \n \nThe water-food-energy\
    \ resources are at the center of sustainable development. The development of smart\
    \ systems \ninterconnected can generate unique opportunities to effectively solve\
    \ the challenges targeted in United Nations’ Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\
    \ It can be emphasized that smart technologies can be able to use as tools for\
    \ game-rule changing, if setting \ntheir systematic integrations, the food-water-energy\
    \ nexus will benefit sustainable development. The strategical use of three \n\
    essential sources for future generations will provide invaluable solutions listed\
    \ here: (1) sustainable food production; (2) access \nto fresh and safe water;\
    \ and (3) renewable energy generation and usage. Human beings have two inevitable\
    \ missions to fulfill \nsustainable development. The first one is to solve the\
    \ interconnections between food - water - energy - climate nexus. The second \n\
    one is to develop smarter machines and systems achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional to digital to improve \nefficiency, decrease input costs and\
    \ resource use, and protect the environment. \n \nIn the new digital era starting\
    \ with the Industry 4.0 revolution, the production capabilities of all industries\
    \ thanks to \ninnovations emerged, including agriculture will have to transform\
    \ in order to feed the rapidly growing population of the world.  \n \nSmart agriculture\
    \ is real-time farm management providing a high degree of automation, and data-driven\
    \ intelligent decision-\nmaking to improve productivity, save natural resources.\
    \ Digital technologies can support farmers' production of safe, sustainable, \n\
    and quality food.  Technological innovations can help us overwhelm many of the\
    \ economic, social, and environmental challenges \nthat agriculture is facing\
    \ today. Novel technologies like the internet of things, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, artificial intelligence, \ndrones, and robotics provide making processes\
    \ more efficient and drive the creation of new products and services and streamline\
    \ \nagricultural operations. \n \nThe driven technology of Agriculture 4.0 is\
    \ the IoT that provides the ability to securely connect end-to-end to anything,\
    \ to \nanywhere. In IoT, numerous wireless sensor network deployed to the field\
    \ can be used along with cloud technologies. Big data \ngathered site-specific\
    \ are transformed into meaningful data set to be used in decision support systems\
    \ for smart applications. The \ncaptured information in the field can be examined\
    \ by computational techniques to reveal trends and patterns, and interactive \n\
    information on human behaviors, environment, and experiences can be transformed\
    \ into efficient actions.  \n \nBy using smart agriculture technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques, it will be possible to monitor in real-time how water, \nchemicals,\
    \ and energy are used for the production of healthy food and animal feed, and\
    \ what environmental effects the applied \nagricultural activity may cause. However,\
    \ this requires the development of national and international policies, the implementation\
    \ \nof strategies, and the control and supervision of processes.  \n \nDeveloped,\
    \ there are many smart farming technologies including decision support system,\
    \ yield monitoring, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, management of crop disease,\
    \ crop monitoring, soil monitoring, treatment of pests with robots, intelligent\
    \ \nharvesting according to maturity, traceability from farm to fork, logistics,\
    \ as well as e-marketing. Although innovation is often \nconceived as techno-centric,\
    \ the rise of Agriculture 4.0 thinking needs to consider also environmental and\
    \ social sustainability \nperspectives. However, challenges related to power,\
    \ performance, and security are obstacles to seamless connectivity.  \n \nThanks\
    \ to developments in recent years, it is seen that digital technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques have the potential to \ntransform agriculture more precisely, efficiently,\
    \ and sustainably. Furthermore, while providing greater transparency for \nDayıoğlu\

    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          395 \n \nconsumers on how food is produced, decision-making\
    \ support has helped farmers in many practices, in terms of environmental \nand\
    \ agricultural performance. Beyond farming, while digital technologies make the\
    \ job more attractive to new generations, they \noffer many opportunities to reduce\
    \ problems related to remoteness and improve access to services. \n \nAlthough\
    \ data-driven technologies play a key role at all stages of the production of\
    \ food and feed in agri-food systems of the \nfuture, none of this can happen\
    \ without enough energy and water from farm to fork. Being clean and sustainable\
    \ the energy used \nin agriculture, not chemically polluted of the water is vital\
    \ to access to fresh water and clean energy everyone, and for a better \nreconstructing\
    \ in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nReferences \n \nAbegaz B W,\

    \ operating a \npiece of land to grow crops and raise livestock or both. It \n\
    includes everything on farm and outside the farm related to \nfarm operations.\
    \ FS could be categorized into (i) extensive \nand intensive FS; (ii) subsistence\
    \ and commercial FS; (iii) \ndry and irrigated FS; (iv) individual and multiple\
    \ FS and \n(v) arable farming, livestock rearing and mixed farming. \nAll of these\
    \ categories might require similar development \nstrategies and interventions\
    \ to have sustainable outcomes \n(Byerlee & Husain, 2008). Thus, FS is an approach\
    \ of \ndeveloping farm strategies based on principles of produc-\ntivity, profitability,\
    \ stability and sustainability. Farming \nsystems research (FSR) is an important\
    \ area to be con-\nsidered for the improvement of agriculture as whole. The \n\
    three main elements of FSR as proposed by Simmonds, \n(2008) are (i) FSR sensu\
    \ stricto (FS deep analysis as they \nexist); (ii) On farm research with farming\
    \ systems perspec-\ntive [OFR/FSP] and (iii) New farming systems develop-\nment\
    \ (NFSD) as shown in Fig. 1. However, component \nfour needs to have new farming\
    \ systems (NFS) under addi-\ntional management and climate change scenarios. Systems\
    \ \nmodeling has been used in FSR, and include linear sta-\ntistical modeling,\
    \ mechanistic modeling, and integrated, \nbioeconomic or socio-ecological models\
    \ (Feola et al., \n2012; Rupnik et al., 2018). Since FSR is an interdiscipli-\n\
    nary approach, its application to simulation models can \nbe adopted to address\
    \ trans-disciplinary tasks. In the past, \ndifferent methods and approaches of\
    \ decision support sys-\ntems were used to answer why and how questions that \n\
    include probabilistic and optimization models (Hindsborg \n& Kristensen, 2019),\
    \ supervised learning models (Wit-\nten & Frank, 2002), Bayesian models (Wang\
    \ et al., 2012), \ntime series analysis (Michel & Makowski, 2013) and \ngenetic\
    \ programming (Samadianfard et al., 2022). Silva \nand Giller, (2021) reported\
    \ about what crop models can \nand can’t (yet) do. They explored current trends\
    \ in crop \nmodeling after reviewing research presented in the 2nd \nInternational\
    \ Crop Modeling Symposium (iCropM2020). \nMost of the focus of the presented work\
    \ was on climate \nchange, adaptation and impact assessment, and much less \n\
    on food security or policy. Similarly, more attention was \non field level work\
    \ with less attention on farming sys-\ntems investigations. There were few contributions\
    \ related \nto model improvement with little work about nutrient \nlimitations,\
    \ pest or disease impacts. Crops models can be \nused to devise hypotheses and\
    \ drive new experiments to \nfulfill above mentioned gaps. Furthermore, outcomes\
    \ of \nthe models should be provided to policy makers so that \nintended purposes\
    \ can be achieved. Finally they reported \nthe importance of cross-scale and interdisciplinary\
    \ efforts \nwith direct engagement of stakeholders to address the \ngrand challenges\
    \ faced by food and agricultural systems \nin the coming century. \nSouth Asia\
    \ is one of the important dry land agricultural \nregions in the world. It covers\
    \ about 3% of the world’s land \narea and is home to a quarter of the world’s\
    \ population. Cli-\nmate change in the form of rise in temperature is hitting\
    \ the \nregion very hard. According to the World Bank, average \nannual temperature\
    \ of the region will increase between 1.5 \nto 3 °C (hotspot) by 2050 in comparison\
    \ to 1981–2010 if no \naction is taken to minimize C emissions (Hoegh-Guldberg\
    \ \net al., 2018). This could put half of the world’s population \nin trouble\
    \ this hotspot could lead to lower crop yield and \ndeclined crop productivity\
    \ (Ainsworth & Ort, 2010). Thus, \nsustainability as a component of FSR is needed\
    \ to mitigate \nclimate change (van Zonneveld et al., 2020) through build-\ning\
    \ strong, resilient system by considering different factors \n(Fig. 2) (van Zonneveld\
    \ et al., 2020). Interactive studies of \nthese components, with the consideration\
    \ of farmers, as a \nbasic foundation is important for designing a logical frame-\n\
    work for FSR (Fig. 3). Hence, key characteristics of FSR \nFig. 1  The four main\
    \ elements of framing systems research (FSR) (A \nFSR sensu stricto, B On farm\
    \ farming system research, C New farm-\ning systems development (NFSD) and D Systems\
    \ Modelling [ Modi-\nfied from Simmonds, (2008)]\n343\nInternational Journal of\
    \ Plant Production (2022) 16:341–363 \n1 3\nare systems thinking, and interdisciplinary\
    \ and participatory \napproaches, and these characteristics are missing in most\
    \ of \nthe South Asian developing countries (Ogada et al., 2020).\nChanges in\
    \ the climatic variables (e.g. temperature and \nrainfall) have been observed\
    \ at shorter time frames e.g. \nmonth, a season, or a year, as well as on longer\
    \ time span, \ni.e., decadal for South Asian countries (Sivakumar & Stefan-\n\
    ski, 2011). This variability for the shorter time span is called \nclimate variability,\
    \ however, for longer time spans it is called \nclimate change. Both are big concerns\
    \ across the globe as \nwell as for South Asian countries (Arora, 2019). Extreme\
    \ \nclimate events at the time of wheat harvesting resulted in \nhuge damage to\
    \ the major staple crop of the region as well \nas to other crops (Ye et al.,\
    \ 2020). However, no adaptation \noptions are currently available to give relief\
    \ to the farmers. \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \ndefines\
    \ climate change as any change in climate over time \ndue to human activity or\
    \ natural variability. It has been \nproven that most of the changes in climatic\
    \ parameters are \nmainly due to human activities on shorter time scale. As \n\
    increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) \ntrap extra heat in the\
    \ earth's atmosphere, higher tempera-\nture results which is called global warming\
    \ or enhanced \ngreenhouse effect. This enhanced effect leads to changes \nin\
    \ the distribution of rainfall, storm intensity, changed pat-\ntern of atmospheric\
    \ circulation and higher temperature at \nthe land/sea surfaces. Most of the earlier\
    \ researchers have \nlinked these physical and biological system changes to \n\
    warming temperature (Rosenzweig et al., 2008). The IPCC \nin their reports predicted\
    \ 1.8–4.0 °C increased temperature \nin 2090–2099 depending upon which scenario\
    \ of future \nGHGs emissions was used to drive climate models (IPCC, \nFig. 2\
    \  Factors used to translate \nworldview concept into concep-\ntualizing research\
    \ and practical \ninquiry\nFig. 3  Set of interacting fac-\ntors (Environment,\
    \ farmers \nand farm) for farming systems \nanalysis\n344\n \nInternational Journal\
    \ of Plant Production (2022) 16:341–363\n1 3\n2007). GRID-Arendal (http:// www.\
    \ grida. no/ about), which \nwas established in 1989 to support environmentally\
    \ sustain-\nable development in collaboration with UN, suggested ways \nto control\
    \ global warming.\nThe temperature increase impacts would be more severe \nfor\
    \ smallholder and subsistence farmers due to their lack \nof adaptive capacity\
    \ particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain \n(Kumar et al., 2020). Since these\
    \ extreme climatic events \nwill significanly impact food production, food security\
    \ in the \nfuture will become an increasingly critical issue (Shi et al., \n2021).\
    \ Food security is a great challenge facing humankind \n(Porter et al., 2014).\
    \ United Nations, in their Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) put food security\
    \ first (Tambu-\nrino et al., 2020). SDGs replaced Millennium Development \nGoal\
    \ Target 1C with an emphasis not only on hunger, but \nalso on sustainability\
    \ and nutrition (Pedercini et al., 2020; \nQu et al., 2020). SDG 2 deals with\
    \ zero hunger. Thus to \nachieve food security, improved nutrition and promote\
    \ sus-\ntainable agriculture, application of a FS approach is essential \n(Allen\
    \ et al., 2019; Eyhorn et al., 2019). This could be chal-\nlenging due to rising\
    \ food demand, changing climate and \ndegraded resources (Mall et al., 2017).\
    \ Godfray et al., (2010) \nreported a serious situation with billions of people\
    \ suffering \nfrom nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition. Sustainable, \n\
    climate-resilient farming systems are needed for nutritional \nquality and food\
    \ security as mentioned in SDG (Altieri et al., \n2015). This is quite a big challenge\
    \ as the number of chroni-\ncally undernourished people is rapidly increasing\
    \ (Witten \n& Frank, 2002). Food security is a massive problem and it \nis worsened\
    \ by climate change. Schmidhuber and Tubiello, \n(2007) concluded that the overall\
    \ impact of climate change \non food security will differ across regions and over\
    \ time. \nThey further reported that climate change will adversely \naffect food\
    \ security and it will increase the dependency of \ndeveloping countries on imports.\
    \ Furthermore, Tesfaye, \n(2021) reported that climate change will threaten food\
    \ secu-\nrity in the hottest wheat growing regions of world. Thus \ntechnological\
    \ options are needed to mitigate climate change \nimpact on food security. These\
    \ options include soil and crop \ninnovation and agricultural land reclamation\
    \ (Horton et al., \n2021). Similarly, recognizing the FS trajectory is necessary\
    \ \nif future food needs are to be met. Sustainable intensifica-\ntion (SI) could\
    \ be an option as it provides more output from \nthe same area of land while minimizing\
    \ negative impacts to \nthe environment (Pretty et al., 2011). The main aim of\
    \ SI \nis to increase yield without adverse environmental impacts \nand the cultivation\
    \ of more land, or increased production \nfrom existing farmland, while minimizing\
    \ environmental \npressure.\nSouth Asia, which has 20% of the world’s population,\
    \ \nfaces severe challenges in agriculture mainly due to climate \nvariability\
    \ (Sivakumar & Stefanski, 2011). It had been docu-\nmented earlier that extreme\
    \ climate events in the form of \nheat and drought will create food security issues\
    \ (Tesfaye, \n2021). Most South Asian regions have witnessed variabil-\nity in\
    \ temperature and rainfall that manifested in frequent \nheat waves, droughts\
    \ and floods leading to great damage to \nagriculture (Almazroui et al., 2020).\
    \ Similarly, the world’s \nlargest river systems (Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra)\
    \ are \nin this region with maximum land usage for agriculture. \nThus, people’s\
    \ livelihoods depend upon management of \navailable natural resources, i.e., soil\
    \ and water. However, \nsustainability of these resources is threatened by extreme\
    \ \nclimate events (Ali et al., 2019). Likewise, due to the high \npopulation\
    \ pressure and poor management water resources \nare becoming stressed (Birendra\
    \ et al., 2021). Since most \nof the land (about 60% of the cropped area) in this\
    \ region is \nrainfed, the agriculturally based economy of these countries \n\
    is heavily dependent upon summer rainfall, i.e., monsoons \n(Arshad et al., 2018;\
    \ van Ogtrop et al., 2014). This region \nis a paradox as it enjoys high economic\
    \ growth but suffers \nfrom food and nutritional insecurity, extreme poverty,\
    \ dete-\nrioration of natural resources and climate change (Stephens \net al.,\
    \ 2018). The management of available natural resources \nin dryland areas is urgent,\
    \ as it will play a crucial role in the \ncoming decades to ensure food security\
    \ and reduction in \npoverty (Baig et al., 2013). Thus, our focus is to review\
    \ gaps, \nand to suggest technology based collaborative intervention \nsuch as\
    \ water conservation, supplemental irrigation, foliar \nsprays, integrated nutrient\
    \ management, resilient crops and \ncropping systems and precision agriculture\
    \ (modeling and \nremote sensing) that can support agriculture of the South \n\
    Asian region under changing climate.\nGaps in Dryland Farming Systems\nRegions\
    \ where the ratio between evaporation and evapo-\ntranspiration is less than 0.65\
    \ are called dryland. Dryland \nfarming is a special case of rainfed agriculture.\
    \ Dryland \nfarming has been practiced primarily in arid and semiarid \nregions\
    \ where annual rainfall is about 20–35% of potential \nevapotranspiration. Moisture\
    \ stress is the main factor limit-\ning yield in this region.\n1. Hence, successful\
    \ management of dryland framing \nsystem depends upon (i) retention of precipitation\
    \ on \nland; (ii) reduction in evaporation and (iii) utilization \nof drought\
    \ tolerant crops. This is possible through SI \nwhich is described as raising\
    \ yields without additional \nland conversion and without harming the environment\
    \ \n(Cassman & Grassini, 2020). Pervez Bharucha et al., \n(2021) produced 100\
    \ questions through a horizon scan-\nning method that point to the gaps in dryland\
    \ farming. \nThese were further categorized into four sections i.e. (i) \nnatural\
    \ resource inputs; (ii) crop and livestock produc-\n345\nInternational Journal\
    \ of Plant Production (2022) 16:341–363 \n1 3\ntion; (iii) agricultural development\
    \ and policy and (iv) \nmarkets and consumption. This important work identi-\n\
    fied major gaps that need to be filled to have SI in dry-\nland framing systems.\
    \ Furthermore, crops grown under \ndryland conditions have a larger yield gap\
    \ that could be \nnarrowed with optimal rotations (Hochman et al., 2020) \nand\
    \ through the use of recommended management prac-\ntices e.g. improved cultivars,\
    \ site specific nutrient man-\nagements through use of precision agriculture and\
    \ water \nharvesting. Therefore, in order to design appropriate \nresearch and\
    \ hypotheses we need to use process-based \nmodels which can easily test what-if\
    \ scenarios. Effect of \nclimate change\nVariation in climatic conditions is one\
    \ of the red-hot sub-\njects in every discipline and it can be quantified by using\
    \ \nmodels as mentioned above. Climatic variability and change \nis affecting\
    \ food production at local, regional and continental \nlevels, therefore, influencing\
    \ the lives of all human beings, \nplants and livestock systems (Williams et al.,\
    \ 2020; Ahmed \n2020). Flora and fauna are particularly influenced by climate\
    \ \nchange because of life-threatening variability in maximum \nand minimum air\
    \ temperature and precipitation patterns in \nall cropping systems (Challinor\
    \ et al., 2014; Hutchings et al., \n2020). Worldwide, the thermal trend is the\
    \ greatest ecologi-\ncal challenge in the current century. For example it leads\
    \ to \nenhanced mean air temperature in major cropping systems \n(Ali et al.,\
    \ 2019). The impact of high temperature (HT), \ndrought (D), or elevated  CO2\
    \  [eCO2] is discussed further in \nthe following sections.\nOverview of Responses\
    \ to High Temperature (HT), \nDrought (D), or elevated  CO2  [eCO2]\nThe influence\
    \ of climatic variables (e.g. air temperature, \nprecipitation and  [eCO2]) on\
    \ cropping systems is com-\nplicated. These variables play a significant part\
    \ in rainfed \ncropping systems (Williams et al., 2020). Warming stress \nconditions\
    \ cause decreases in crop productivity (Zampieri \net al., 2020). Higher air temperature\
    \ stress from sowing to \nmaturity restricts crop growth and shortens the crop\
    \ cycle \n(Hatfield & Dold, 2018). Higher temperature than optimum \nhastens anthesis\
    \ and induces floral aberrations (e.g., sta-\nmen hypoplasia and pistil hyperplasia),\
    \ which negatively \nimpacts proper reproductive accomplishment in cereal crops.\
    \ \nFurthermore, very poor dehiscence of anthers, poor pollen \ngrain formation\
    \ and reduced viability of pollen are recog-\nnized as primary causes of stress-induced\
    \ unproductiveness \nand kernel abortion in maize and wheat (He et al., 2018).\
    \ \nDuring the grain filling period, higher air temperature stress \nnegatively\
    \ influences grain quality. Too little water has a \ngreater negative influence\
    \ than high-rainfall events in vari-\nous cropping systems (Jalota et al., 2013).\
    \ Serious water \nshortage during kernel filling resulted in earlier senescence\
    \ \nand a shorter grain filling period as well as lower green flag-\nleaf area\
    \ perseverance in cereal crops (Asseng et al., 2019). \nMeanwhile,  [eCO2] has\
    \ shown a positive effect on crop bio-\nmass production but higher concentrations\
    \ of  CO2 lead to \nelevation of tissue temperature. However, interactive effects\
    \ \nof these climatic variables on crop production might be dif-\nferent (Rajwade\
    \ et al., 2015).\nHigh Temperature and Drought Interaction\nHigh air temperature\
    \ and drought stress are now frequent \nevents. In most cropping systems, drought\
    \ has been intensi-\nfied due to higher air temperature stress (Högy et al., 2013).\
    \ \nMittler, (2006) documented the effect of multiple abiotic \nstresses e.g.\
    \ combination of HT and D stress on crops under \nfield conditions. The combined\
    \ impact of HT and D stress \non crops like barley and wheat was found to be more\
    \ severe \nas compared to a single stress (Shah & Paulsen, 2003). Rang \net al.,\
    \ (2011) reported that HT and D interact and it has been \nseen in most parts\
    \ of Europe where the interaction resulted \nin decreased productivity of wheat\
    \ and maize (Ciais et al., \n2005). In Asia HT and D stress was seen during the\
    \ critical \ndevelopmental stages of rice which resulted in major losses \nin\
    \ the rice based cropping systems (Wassmann et al., 2009). \nZhang and Huang,\
    \ (2012) documented yield reduction in \nthree major cereals i.e. rice, wheat\
    \ and maize, in the north-\nern part of China due to HT and D stress. The combined\
    \ \ndetrimental effect of HT and D on cereal, i.e., rice, sorghum, \nwheat, barley,\
    \ and maize, was more severe as compared to \nindividual HT or D impact (Cotter\
    \ et al., 2020). Cohen et al., \n(2020) conducted meta-analysis of HT and D stress\
    \ on crop \nyield and yield components. They concluded that a signifi-\ncant decrease\
    \ in crop yield was due to the combined impact \nof HT and D on harvest index,\
    \ life cycle, seed number, seed \nsize and seed composition. The consequences\
    \ of drought \nare amplified at higher temperature than lower air tempera-\nture,\
    \ worldwide. The synergistic interactions of higher tem-\nperature and drought\
    \ showed a decreased production more \nthrough the mutual stresses than by either\
    \ stress alone, and \nthat much of the influence was on physiological processes\
    \ in \ncrop plants in arid environments (Amarasingha et al., 2015).\nInteractive\
    \ Impact of  High Temperature and  Drought \non Water Use Efficiency Water use\
    \ efficiency (WUE) is the \nratio of the unit crop dry matter produced per unit\
    \ of water \nused. Blum, (2009) reported that WUE increases under D \nwhile it\
    \ decreases under HT stress. Rollins et  al., (2013) \nrecorded a 45% decrease\
    \ in WUE of grain yield (g grain \n L−1) in barley due to HT × D stress while\
    \ Shah and Paulsen, \n(2003) reported, − 34 to + 24% change in WUE (g grain \n\
    \ L−1) in wheat. Future climate change might increase the fre-\nquency and intensity\
    \ of extreme events like drought which \n346\n \nInternational Journal of Plant\
    \ Production (2022) 16:341–363\n1 3\nwill limit crop growth and yields. Increasing\
    \ WUE and yield \nper unit of water is one of the most important challenge in\
    \ \ndryland farming (Yulianti et al., 2016). Higher air tempera-\nture and drought\
    \ stress interaction might reduce WUE, as \nwarming trend will lead to higher\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) \nin the future. Furthermore, the interaction will also\
    \ increase \ncrop water demand in dry and windy situations as compared \nto humid\
    \ and cool climatic circumstances (Porter, 2005). \nIn South Asia, lower WUE and\
    \ productivity in most of the \ncropping systems are mainly because of extreme\
    \ climatic \nshocks. This will further lead to problems related to food \nsecurity,\
    \ as climate change induced crop productivity will \nnegatively impact food production\
    \ and prices in all south \nAsian countries (Thompson et al., 2017). Similarly,\
    \ water \nstress significantly impacts physiological mechanisms of \ncrops grown\
    \ in dryland cropping systems. Their results \nshowed that interactive stress\
    \ resulted in 60–92% reduction \nin photosynthesis as compared to non-stressed\
    \ conditions. \nAdditionally, 28% rise in WUE was indicated under drought \nstress\
    \ at middle/suboptimal level, however, it was reduced \nby 35% at high temperature\
    \ (Kaur et al., 2012). Williams \net al., (2020) studied crop yield, WUE, precipitation\
    \ capture \nand soil water storage in a dryland cropping system under a \ngiven\
    \ set of crop sequence treatments. WUE was calculated \nby using following formulae:\n\
    where CY = Crop yield, HHP + 휃d = Crop water use i.e. \nHHP = Sum of the precipitation\
    \ that fell between harvests. \n(HHP) and 휃d = Soil water depletion in mm of soil\
    \ water \ndepleted between seeding and harvest.\nAdditionally, precipitation use\
    \ efficiency (PUE) from \nseeding to harvest was calculated as:\nwhere STHP =\
    \ Amount of precipitation from date of sewing \nto harvest.\nHowever, PUE over\
    \ the year ( PUECYP) could be calcu-\nlated by using the following formula:\n\
    where CYP = Crop year precipitation in mm.\nSoil water use efficiency (SWUE) can\
    \ be calculated as \nused by Williams et al., (2020):\nwhere 휃depletion = Soil\
    \ water depletion (mm) between seeding \nand harvest of a crop.\n(1)\nWUE =\n\

    휃depletion\nThe work of Williams et al., (2020) suggested that in \norder to increase\
    \ WUE, PUE, SWUE and crop productivity \nwe should increase diversification and\
    \ improve conservation \nof water under low rainfall dryland conditions. Furthermore,\
    \ \nthey also suggested the use of higher yielding, drought toler-\nant crop varieties\
    \ to improve climatic and economic resil-\nience in dryland cropping systems.\n\
    Interactive Impact of  High Temperature and  Drought \non Nitrogen Use Efficiency\
    \ Nitrogen (N) is very important \nfor all type of farming systems but its losses\
    \ in the form of \nvolatilization and leaching are big environmental concerns\
    \ \n(Hutchings et  al., 2020). Ammonia  (NH3) emissions and \nnitrate  (NO3\n\
    −) pollution are big threats to the environment \nand to human health, and their\
    \ primary source is the agricul-\ntural sector (Schullehner et al., 2018). Meanwhile,\
    \ livestock \nproduction has a large environmental footprint (Leip et al., \n\
    2015). Environmental performance of crop production sys-\ntems can be monitored\
    \ by nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), \nwhich is a very useful indicator (Antille\
    \ & Moody, 2021). \nNitrogen use efficiency is negatively affected under higher\
    \ \ntemperature and drought conditions (Hutchings et al., 2020). \nNUE can be\
    \ calculated as proposed by Rahimizadeh et al., \n(2010):\nwhere GY = Grain yield\
    \ and Nsupply = Soil N content at sow-\ning + total N fertilizer applied.\nCammarano\
    \ et  al., (2020) concluded that negative \nimpacts of rainfall and temperature\
    \ on crop production could \nbe offset by applying additional water and nitrogen.\
    \ Nitrogen \nleaching and NUE strongly correlated as higher leaching \nresults\
    \ to lower NUE. Webber et al., (2015) simulated water \nand N-water limited yield\
    \ across Europe and concluded \nthat future N fertilization rates need to be assessed\
    \ through \nintegrated approaches. Fagodiya et al., (2017) reported the \nalteration\
    \ of global N cycle due to global warming and \nclimate change. They concluded\
    \ that N fertilizer acts as a \nsource of global warming (due to  N2O emission)\
    \ as well as \ncooling  [NH3 (Reduced N compounds) and NOX (oxidized \nN compounds)].\
    \ Thus, they recommended that both warm-\ning and cooling effects should be studied\
    \ in the future. The \nimpact of climate change on crop duration/yields, water/N\
    \ \nbalance and NUE in a rice–wheat cropping system was stud-\nied by Jalota et al.,\
    \ (2013) using the CropSyst model. The \nresults showed that around 20 and 29%\
    \ of applied N goes \nto gaseous loss while 10 and 0% to leaching, 69 and 72%\
    \ to \nnitrogen uptake and 0 and 2% to immobilization in rice and \nwheat crops,\
    \ respectively. This confirms the earlier findings \nwhere they reported 17–28%\
    \ gaseous loss (Reddy & Patrick, \n1975), 60–77% as N uptake (Aulakh et al., 2000)\
    \ and 9–36% \n(5)\nNUE =\nGY\nNsupply\n347\nInternational Journal of Plant Production\

    \ Drought \non Agronomic Efficiency: Yield and Yield Components Crop \nyield components\
    \ and yield depend on air temperature dur-\ning the crop growing season. An increase\
    \ in air tempera-\nture can have positive or negative effects on agronomic effi-\n\
    ciency and crop water need (Rajwade et al., 2015). It has \nbeen reported that\
    \ HT can cause earlier crop maturity due \nto fast completion of different phenological\
    \ stages (Hyles \net al., 2020). Earlier maturity results in a reduction in crop\
    \ \nyield and quality (Högy et al., 2013). Zhao et al., (2017) \nevaluated the\
    \ impact of global temperature increase on \nthe production of four major crops\
    \ i.e. wheat, rice, maize, \nand soybean. They concluded that each degree-Celsius\
    \ \nincrease in global mean temperature would, on average, \nreduce global yields\
    \ of wheat by 6.0%, rice by 3.2%, maize \nby 7.4%, and soybean by 3.1%. They reported\
    \ this impact \nwithout adjustments for  CO2 fertilization, effective adap-\n\
    tation, and genetic improvement. Heat and water stress in \ncombination have significant\
    \ strong impacts on crop yield, \nand this combination prevails in dryland agriculture\
    \ nowa-\ndays. Ostmeyer et al., (2020) reviewed the impacts of heat, \ndrought,\
    \ and their interaction with nutrients on crop physi-\nology, grain yield and\
    \ quality of crops. They concluded that \ndrought stress impacts can be ameliorated\
    \ by the use of \nnutrients. Knox et al., (2012) studied the projected impacts\
    \ \nof climate change on the yield of eight major crops in Africa \nand South\
    \ Asia. They reported that overall yield change \nfor all crops in each region\
    \ was − 8% by 2050. However, \nthey estimated − 17%, − 5%, − 15% and − 10% mean\
    \ yield \nchange across Africa for wheat, maize, sorghum and mil-\nlet respectively.\
    \ The yield change in South Asia was − 16% \n(maize) and − 11% (sorghum). They\
    \ recommended that the \ndeleterious effect of climate change could be mitigated\
    \ by \nadaptation options such as shifting planting dates, modify-\ning crop rotations,\
    \ development of new crop varieties and \nexpansion of irrigation infrastructure.\
    \ However, these adap-\ntations require investments in resource poor countries.\n\
    High Temperature and Elevated  CO2 Interaction\nCarbon dioxide affects crop physiological\
    \ processes directly \nor indirectly. The direct effect include photosynthesis\
    \ and \nstomatal physiology (Kadam et al., 2014). Allen, (1994) \nelaborated the\
    \ direct effects of  CO2 on crops and indirect \neffects of  CO2 through possible\
    \ climate change. Elevated \n CO2 has shown a positive effect on growth and development,\
    \ \nwhich was greater during earlier growth stages as compared \nto later growth\
    \ stages. It is now well known that increased \n CO2 concentrations result in\
    \ greater production of carbo-\nhydrates and biomass (Thompson et al., 2017).\
    \ Similarly, \nenhanced yield and crop productivity have been reported due \n\
    to higher photosynthesis under  [eCO2] in many crop species \n(Bocianowski et al.,\
    \ 2018). However, Mittler et al., (2012) \nreported negative impact on crop yield\
    \ under increased tem-\nperature because of  [eCO2]. An average 3 to 5 °C rise\
    \ in \ntemperature has been documented due to the doubling of \n CO2 concentration\
    \ (Arora & Kumar, 2018). The interactive \neffect of temperature and  [eCO2] results\
    \ in the partial clo-\nsure of stomata which could reduce transpiration and lead\
    \ \nto changes in leaf temperature in all cropping systems. Win-\nslow et al.,\
    \ (2003) documented that  [eCO2] benefits can be \noffset by higher temperature\
    \ since a rise in temperature can \ncause shortening of crop growing period. The\
    \ interactive \neffect of high temperature and  [eCO2] on WUE, nitrogen \nuse\
    \ efficiency and agronomic efficiency has been highlighted \nfurther in this section.\n\
    Interactive Impact of High Temperature and Elevated  CO2 \non  Water Use Efficiency\
    \ The intearctive effect of high \ntempearture and  [eCO2] on WUE is shown in\
    \ Fig. 4. The \nincrease or decrease in WUE will be due to direct or indirect\
    \ \neffects of these two variables on physiological, biochemical \nand crop growth\
    \ traits. Similarly, these two variables have \nlinkage with RuBiSCO (Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate\
    \ car-\nboxylase/oxygenase) either through carboxylation or pho-\ntorespiration.\
    \ RuBiSCO is an enzyme involved in the first \nmajor step of carbon fixation.\
    \ It catalyzes the carboxylation \nof RuBP (Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate). Higher\
    \ tempearture \nresults in photorespiration by promoting oxygenation reac-\ntions\
    \ as compared to  [eCO2] where carboxylation increases \n(Ainsworth et al., 2020).\
    \ Higher WUE due to  [eCO2] could \nbe because of decreased stomatal conductance\
    \ and density \nwhich will not be the case under higher tempearture (Maes-\ntre\
    \ et al., 2012; Olivoto et al., 2017). Polley, (2002) reported \nthat  [eCO2]\
    \ could counteract the higher tempearture effect \non evapotranspiration.\nInteractive\
    \ Impact of High Temperature and Elevated  CO2 \non Nitrogen Use Efficiency Nitrogen\
    \ use efficiency of agri-\ncultural crops at local, regional and continental levels\
    \ is \nnegatively influenced by the interactive effects of  [eCO2] \nand other\
    \ climatic variables. The role of  CO2 is very cru-\ncial in crop physiology,\
    \ by affecting photosynthesis, crop \ngrowth and yield (Wei et al., 2018). It\
    \ has been documented \nthat stomatal activity, biomass production and WUE are\
    \ \nhighly correlated. However,  [eCO2] leads to lower nutrient \nuptake, particularly\
    \ N, because of restricted root nutrient \nuptake and a dilution effect (Myers\
    \ et al., 2014). Li et al., \n(2019) reported higher photosynthetic rate and lower\
    \ chlo-\nrophyll content in the flag leaf of wheat under  [eCO2] as \ncompared\
    \ to ambient  CO2. Additionally, higher N fertiliza-\ntion resulted in a higher\
    \ grain number per spike in  [eCO2]. \nThus, high temperature and  [eCO2] have\
    \ negative impacts \n348\n \nInternational Journal of Plant Production (2022)\

    ity in the future (Jobe et al., 2020).\nInteractive Impact of High Temperature\
    \ and Elevated  CO2 \non Agronomic Efficiency: Yield and Yield Components High\
    \ \ntemperature with  [eCO2] resulted in higher yield and yield \ncomponents (Challinor\
    \ et  al., 2014). Some positive and \nsome negative effects of a combination of\
    \ high temperature \nand  [eCO2] on canopy photosynthesis (μmol  m−2  s−1), leaf\
    \ \nphotosynthesis (μmol   m−2   s−1), WUE (mmol  mol−1) and \nphotosynthetic\
    \ WUE was reported in earlier work (Prasad & \nJagadish, 2015). However, the interactive\
    \ effect of high tem-\nperature and  [eCO2] have shown positive effects on wheat\
    \ \ngrain yield (+ 6% to + 40%) as well as rice yield (+ 69%) \n(Rakshit et al.,\
    \ 2012). The interactive effect of high temper-\nature and  [eCO2] on the grain\
    \ weight of crops remained neg-\native (Bocianowski et al., 2018). Roy et al.,\
    \ (2012) reported \nspikelet sterility in rice due to the interactive effect of\
    \ high \ntemperature and  [eCO2] which is the major cause of yield \nreduction.\n\
    Elevated  CO2 and Drought Interaction\nElevated  CO2 and drought increases WUE\
    \ from leaf level \nto ecosystem level in  C3 as well as in  C4 plants (Kumar\
    \ \net al., 2019). Synergistic responses have been observed \nbetween  [eCO2]\
    \ and drought for WUE among most plants \n(Noor et al., 2003). In  C3 plants \
    \ [eCO2] increases WUE \nthrough fixation of carbon and decreased transpiration.\
    \ \nHowever, in  C4 plants increased WUE is mainly due to the \ndecreased transpiration\
    \ rate. Conley et al., (2001) docu-\nmented increased WUE in sorghum by 16 and\
    \ 17% and \n47% to 52% for  C3 cherry under irrigated and dry conditions \nrespectively.\
    \ This was mainly due to a decrease in evapo-\ntranspiration (Hussain et al.,\
    \ 2013). In sugarcane, a  C4 plant, \nstomatal conductance  (gs) and WUE under\
    \ severe drought \nand ambient  CO2 decreased by 95% and 93% respectively \nin\
    \ comparison with control. However, under drought stress \nand  [eCO2] the drop\
    \ in  gs and WUE was 80% and 26% of the \ncontrols values respectively (Vu & Allen,\
    \ 2009). Wall et al., \n(2011) reported drought avoidance in barley due to  [eCO2].\
    \ \nIt causes 34% reduction in  gs and conservation of water for a \nlonger period\
    \ under water stress conditions. Another impor-\ntant adaptation feature is an\
    \ increase in stomatal size and a \ndecrease in stomatal density due to  [eCO2]\
    \ and moderate \nwater stress (Fig. 5).\nDryland Cropping System and Soil\nDryland\
    \ agriculture accounts for 80% of the world’s culti-\nvated land and contributes\

    \ the \nmain question researchers look for is what the impact of \nglobal warming\
    \ on the amount of carbon in the soil will \nbe. Under current cultural practices,\
    \ e.g. chisel and deep \nploughing in rainfed cropping systems there is chance\
    \ of \nincrease  CO2 emissions from soils (Farina et al., 2011). \nSimilarly,\
    \ due to increased global warming and drought \nin the future, there is a possibility\
    \ of more loss of soil \norganic carbon (SOC) because of higher soil respiration\
    \ as \nshown in Fig. 6. Crowther et al., (2016) quantified global \nSOC losses\
    \ in response to warming. They reported more \nsoil carbon losses at higher latitude.\
    \ However, they found \na positive association between HT and SOC loss. Gener-\n\
    ally, higher temperature and  [eCO2] could promote crop \nproductivity and SOC.\
    \ However, higher temperature pro-\nmotes soil organic matter decomposition and\
    \ loss of SOC. \nA positive interaction between HT and  [eCO2] for crop \ngrowth,\
    \ yield and SOC has been reported (Kimball, 2011). \nPugnaire et al., (2019) reviewed\
    \ plant soil feedback inter-\nactions under climate change. Climate change affects\
    \ the \nplants’ inputs to soil through litter and rhizodeposits. They \nreported\
    \ that drought led to the provision of low-quality \nlitter, low nutrient content\
    \ to soil and lower decomposi-\ntion rate.\nSoil is home to millions of fungi,\
    \ billions of bacteria \nand other microorganisms, and extreme climate events\
    \ are \nshowing detrimental effects to these organisms. Since these \nmicroorganisms\
    \ play an important role in C and nutrient \ncycling, their absence or deficiency\
    \ can cause poor soil fer-\ntility and productivity (Pugnaire et al., 2019). It\
    \ has been \nwell documented that long term warming causes changes in \nmicrobe\
    \ communities (Cavicchioli et al., 2019). Bintanja, \n(2018) reported that a 5 °C\
    \ increase in temperature shifted \nthe ratio of bacteria to fungi causing alteration\
    \ in the respira-\ntion rate of the soil microbial community. Temperature and\
    \ \nrespiration are strongly correlated, thus the role of elevated \ntemperature\
    \ and microbial metabolism recently attracted \nattention in research (Gao et al.,\
    \ 2018). Intensive agricul-\nture in dry land farming systems is the main cause\
    \ of loss of \nbelowground biodiversity, leading to poor soil health. This \n\
    loss will be more severe under changing climate as climate \nchange has direct\
    \ and indirect impacts on soil communi-\nties (Dubey et al., 2019). Therefore,\
    \ it is important to adopt \nsustainable management practices so that we can promote\
    \ a \nhealthy soil microbiome in dry land cropping systems.\nCarbon sequestration\
    \ in rainfed cropping systems could \nbe increased by adoption of practices like\
    \ diversified crop-\nping systems, cover crops, crop residue incorporation, \n\

    that with an addition of 1 ton of carbon to the soil carbon \npool in degraded\
    \ croplands, the yield of crop might increase \nby 20–40 kg  ha−1 for wheat, 10–20 kg \
    \ ha−1 for maize and \n0.5–1 kg  ha−1 for cowpeas. Thus, C sequestration has great\
    \ \npotential to enhance food security and offset fossil fuel emis-\nsions (0.4–1.2\
    \ giga tons C  year−1).\nOverview of Responses to Biotic Stresses\nHuman activities\
    \ and natural events are accelerating changes \nin the global environment. The\
    \ changes include increas-\ning GHGs that result in increased global temperature\
    \ and \nchanges in water availability in coming years. These changes \nhave also\
    \ shown profound effects on biotic stresses such as \ndisease prevalence and development,\
    \ insect pest attacks and \nweeds abundance. Weeds are unwanted plants that compete\
    \ \nfor resources and causes huge losses to crop growth, yield \nand grain quality.\
    \ They are also host of insect pests and \npathogens. It has been reported previously\
    \ that weed dynam-\nics in different cropping systems is significantly affected\
    \ by \nthe changes in temperature, rainfall and  [eCO2] (Ziska & \nMcConnell,\
    \ 2015). Climate change is affecting weed-crop \ninteractions, weed ecology and\
    \ weed management. Bajwa \net al., (2020) reviewed impacts of climate change elements,\
    \ \ni.e., HT, D and  [eCO2], on wheat pests. They reported that \nclimate change\
    \ favors the expansion, growth and multiplica-\ntion of wheat pests. Furthermore,\
    \ climate change opens new \ngeographic windows for weed infestations (Mao et al.,\
    \ 2021; \nVilà et al., 2021), insect biodiversity (Raven & Wagner, \n2021) and\
    \ disease outbreaks (Chaloner et al., 2021) across \nFig. 6  Interactive effect\

    \ will vary from place to place as \ndrier climate might have low disease and\
    \ insect occurrence \nin future (Dudney et al., 2021). Thus researchers suggested\
    \ \napplication of integrated pest management approaches such \nas frequent pest\
    \ scouting, disease forecasting and predictive \nmodeling to combat climate change\
    \ induced biotic stresses.\nCrops in the future will be more susceptible to biotic\
    \ \nstresses, e.g., weed invasions, pest attacks and diseases \n(Chauhan et al.,\
    \ 2012). Weeds have shown very positive \nresponse to HT and  [eCO2] as reported\
    \ by Mahajan et al., \n(2012). Ramesh et al., (2017) reported interactive effects\
    \ \nof climate change variables on weeds. Increased tempera-\nture, D and  [eCO2]\
    \ will result in higher weed growth with \ndominance of  C4 weeds in the cropping\
    \ systems. Therefore, \nin the future under climate change there will be more\
    \ weed \npressure. Peters et al., (2014) reviewed the climate change \nimpacts\
    \ on weeds and reported that thermophile late matur-\ning weeds are becoming more\
    \ prominent, causing greater \ndamage to crops in the cropping systems. Generally,\
    \ weeds \nor plant species show three kinds of reactions to climate \nchange i.e.\
    \ (i) migration; (ii) acclimation and (iii) adaptation \n(Vilà et al., 2021).\
    \ In the future, we will have to adopt sus-\ntainable weed management options\
    \ to minimize the impact \nof weeds on cropping systems.\nClimate change will\
    \ increase the intensity of crop dis-\neases in coming decades. Ziska et al.,\
    \ (2011) observed more \nprevalence of rust disease in soybean due to climate\
    \ change \nin all growing areas of Africa and across the globe. Biotic \nstress\
    \ will worsen the situation by indirectly affecting water, \nfertilizer and radiation\
    \ use efficiency and ultimately yield \nand yield components in different cropping\
    \ systems (Blois \net al., 2013). During recent years, an epidemic of leaf and\
    \ \nstem rust linked with strains of wheat is spreading in most \nagriculture\
    \ regions across the globe due to climate vari-\nability. Increased rainfall and\
    \ humid environmental condi-\ntions are favoring leaf and stem rust but on the\
    \ other hand, \nfrequent drought may limit this spread with the reduction \nof\
    \ yield in various cropping systems. Grey leaf spot is a \ndisease that is becoming\
    \ an epidemic in various regions \nof world (Korres et al., 2016). During the\
    \ 1st half of the \ntwentieth century Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt),\
    \ black \nstem rust of wheat, caused a serious outbreak. It results in \na 19%\
    \ to 28% reduction in wheat yield. However, research-\ners have controlled this\
    \ disease by selecting wheat varieties \nwith resistance and by removal of the\
    \ alternate host in wheat \ngrowing regions. A new race of Pgt was found in Uganda\
    \ in \n1998 named Ug99. Ug99 has the capacity to cause disease in \n90% of world\
    \ wheat population as it can overcome the genes \nSr31 and Sr38. The Ug99 wheat\
    \ stem rust is a future chal-\nlenge that could be worsened by climate change\
    \ (Hernandez \nNopsa et al., 2014). It causes stem rust epidemics in Africa \n\
    and the Near east by controlling the widely used resistance \ngene Sr31. Ug99can\
    \ also become a potential threat to wheat \nthroughout Asia (Lucas, 2017). The\
    \ spread and emergence \nof Ug99 stimulated a coordinated international initiative\
    \ to \nidentify effective sources of resistance in wheat. This could \nhelp to\
    \ develop varieties that can be deployed in regions \nwhere new races are present\
    \ or are likely to emerge (see \nhttps:// bgri. corne ll. edu/). Plants pathogens\
    \ and environment \ninteract closely. This interaction was described as a disease\
    \ \ntriangle with environment at the central point (Pautasso \net al., 2010).\
    \ Changes in environmental variables, i.e., tem-\nperature, rainfall and  CO2,\
    \ will affect this disease interaction \ntriangle favoring occurrence of more\
    \ pathogen. Fischer and \nKnutti, (2015) reported that weather is the key driver\
    \ of dis-\nease outbreaks, so understanding disease dynamics under \nchanging\
    \ climate is necessary to have appropriate control \nmeasures.\nAdaptation/Mitigation\
    \ to Climate Variability \nand Change\nAgricultural production is impaired by\
    \ extreme climate \nevents. This damage could lead to issues of crop failure,\
    \ \nlower crop yield, poor crop quality and finally food inse-\ncurity at local,\
    \ regional and global levels if proper adap-\ntation measures are not urgently\
    \ taken. Adaptations are \nactions taken to mitigate the damages caused by climate\
    \ \nvariability. The IPCC defines adaptation as the adjustment \nin systems in\
    \ response to climate stimuli. Generally, if net \ndamages are high as in case\
    \ of 2–3.5 °C warming, then \nthe adaptation cost will be higher as compared to\
    \ 1.5 °C \nwarming where less adaptive efforts will be required \n(National Academies\
    \ of Sciences and Medicine, 2017). \nUnited Nations 17 SDGs could be considered\
    \ as guide-\nlines for the development of climate change adaptation \nmeasures\

    \ Mimura et al., (2015) recommended antici-\npatory adaptation or adaptation planning\
    \ where measures \nare taken in advance to prevent adverse impacts. Exam-\nples\
    \ include early warning systems (e.g. seasonal climate \nforecasts and disease\
    \ forecasting), land use planning, crop \nyield forecasting and management of\
    \ water resources. \nTravis et al., (2018) suggested that reactive adaptation\
    \ has \na better chance to keep pace with lower levels of warm-\ning in many production\
    \ systems. Adaptation can also \ninclude disaster risk management plans or risk\
    \ transfer \nmechanisms through which risk effects can be minimized \nor compensated\
    \ (e.g. crop insurance and diversification). \nAdaptation and mitigation have\

    \ have been presented in Table 1 (Ahmed, \n2020; IPCC 2007, 2014a, b).\nAdaptation\
    \ and mitigation are possible through tech-\nnology change and by adding to systems\
    \ options that can \nreduce resource inputs and emissions of GHGs. Waha \net \
    \ al., (2013) concluded that benefits from concomi-\ntant positive effects of\
    \ climate change e.g.  [eCO2] and \nincreased rainfall is possible through adaptation\
    \ strategies. \nThese strategies include change in sowing date, appropri-\nate\
    \ choice of cropping systems and crops. Furthermore, \nadverse impacts of heat\
    \ and drought stress could be mod-\nerated through adaptation measures. Abid et al.,\
    \ (2019) \nanalyzed farmers’ perceptions about climate change and \nexplored connections\
    \ between different stages of adapta-\ntion, i.e., perceptions, intention and\
    \ implementation. In \ntheir work, they stated that local perceptions of climate\
    \ \nchange are important considerations for the design and \nimplementation of\
    \ adaptive measures at the farm level. \nMoreover, the study reported farmers’\
    \ education as an \nimportant precursor to implement the adaptive meas-\nures\
    \ effectively (Ghose et al., 2021). However, factors \nthat can improve farmers’\
    \ adaptive behavior to climate \nchange include weather forecasting, market information,\
    \ \nadvisory services, and farming experience. Furthermore, \nlarge-scale farmers\
    \ were able to adapt to climate change \nthrough change in planting dates and\
    \ selection of new, \nadapted varieties. However, small land holding farmers \n\
    need more attention so that they can easily access infor-\nmation, institutional\
    \ services and resources to succeed in \nthe face of climate change. Further detail\
    \ about possible \nadaptation measures is discussed below:\nIntroduction of Legumes\
    \ in the Cropping System\nIntroduction of legumes in the exhaustive cropping systems\
    \ \n(e.g. fallow-wheat, cotton-wheat, rice–wheat, maize-maize, \npotato-wheat\
    \ or maize-wheat) can be beneficial to reduce \nthe negative impacts of climate\
    \ change. Similarly, legumes \ncan provide quality food and feed. Legumes could\
    \ help to \nreduce the use of fertilizers and energy, and consequently \nlower\
    \ GHG emissions. Thus, they are considered environ-\nment-friendly crops. Legumes\
    \ can also minimize the use \nof nitrogenous fertilizers by significantly reducing\
    \ the level \nof  N2O (e.g. 1 kg of N as  N2O is produced per 100 kg of N \nfertilizer)\
    \ one of the active GHGs. Furthermore, legumes \ncan also provide N effect (N\
    \ provision through BNF) and \nbreak crop effect (non-legume specific benefits\
    \ e.g. improve-\nment of soil structure and organic matter contents, soil water\
    \ \nholding capacity and availability, phosphorus mobilization \nand reduced biotic\
    \ stress pressure) (Stagnari et al., 2017). \nIntroduction of legumes in the cropping\
    \ system could pro-\nvide multiple benefits, e.g., (i) environmental (ii) socio-\n\
    economic (iii) crop diversification (iv) soil restoration (v) \nwater conservation\
    \ and (vi) reduce use of external inputs. \nFurthermore, legumes have high potential\
    \ for conservation \nagriculture. Mousavi-Derazmahalleh et al., (2019) recom-\n\
    mended legume crops as adaptive measures in response to \nclimate change. Jensen\

    \ source of biomass to produce biofuels. In conclusion, \nthey recommended that\
    \ due to multiple benefits of legumes \nthey should be considered as an important\
    \ component of \nfuture agroecosystems. Leguminous crops also improve soil \n\
    organic matter and act as a restorative crop. Under current \nand future climate\
    \ variability, sowing of legumes with major \ncrops can be very useful approach\
    \ (Sayari et al., 2015).\nBiodiversity\nDiversification is a spatio-temporal process\
    \ where the objec-\ntive is to have heterogenous farming systems. On-farm \nand\
    \ off-farm diversification can build system resilience to \nclimate shocks (Fig. 7).\
    \ The issues of climate change and \nbiodiversity are interconnected. Protection\
    \ of biodiversity \ncan help systems adapt to climate change. Biodiversity \n\
    promotes healthy systems which will be more resilient to \nclimate change. It\
    \ can help us to work with, rather than \nagainst, nature. Hisano et al., (2018)\
    \ reported that biodiver-\nsity can mitigate climate change as diverse systems\
    \ could be \nmore resilient to climate change. Furthermore, it can help \nto improve\
    \ ecosystem functioning. Hufford et al., (2019) \nreviewed crop biodiversity as\
    \ potential way to adapt agri-\nculture to global climate change. They reported\
    \ the impo-\nratnce of crop biodivesity as it will fullfill the qualitative or\
    \ \nquantitative demands of the agricultural production system \nin future.\n\
    Genetic Modifications of Crops\nThe development of resistant crop cultivars through\
    \ differ-\nent omics techniques could help to mitigate climate change. \nSpeed\
    \ breeding is a great example developed by Dr. Hickey \nto expand crop diversity\
    \ to feed 10 billion people and accel-\nerate the rate of crop improvement (Watson\
    \ et al., 2018). The \nnewly developed cultivars will have higher tolerance to\
    \ heat \nstress, severe water shortage, pests and diseases. Lopes et al., \n(2015)\
    \ reported the importance of adaptive genotypic traits \nto the maintenance of\
    \ grain yields in dry and warm years. \nFurthermore, they suggested that landraces\
    \ should be used \nas valuable sources of genetic diversity and stress adapta-\n\
    tion. The authors also emphasized the development of data-\nbases and the promotion\
    \ of data sharing strategies among \nbreeders, quality scientists, pathologists\
    \ and physiologists \nso that improvements in adaptation to climate change go\
    \ \nworldwide. Moreover, cultivars with higher water, nutrient \nand radiation\
    \ use efficiency, and cultivars which can tolerate \nwater logging, salinity and\
    \ drought stresses, are required. \nAtlin et al., (2017) reviewed plant breeding\
    \ and varietal \nreplacement as critical options for adaptation to climate \n\
    change. They reported that since most varieties available \nto smallholder farmers\
    \ are obsolete, the breeding system \nshould be strengthened in such a way that\
    \ small farmers \ncould also benefit from new cultivars.\nChange in Crop Management\
    \ Practices\nThe extreme effects of climate variability on cropping sys-\ntems\
    \ could be mitigated by adopting proper crop manage-\nment practices. These include\
    \ changes in the planting date \nand geometry, proper management of irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer \npractices (rate, placement and timing), optimization of plant-\n\
    ing density and appropriate use of seed rate (Kumar et al., \n2021). Asgedom and\
    \ Kebreab, (2011) reviewed beneficial \nFig. 7  Levels of diversifica-\ntion both\
    \ on-farm and off-farm \n(Duong et al., 2021)\n354\n \nInternational Journal of\
    \ Plant Production (2022) 16:341–363\n1 3\nmanagement practices and GHG mitigation\
    \ options to mini-\nmize climate change impacts. Planting date shifts can help\
    \ \nto develop stress avoidance, e.g., anthesis may be timed to \navoid heat stress.\
    \ In rainfed conditions, close row-to-row and \nplant-to-plant spacing can hasten\
    \ canopy coverage of the soil \nsurface and consequently, reduce evaporation losses\
    \ (Ahmad \net al., 2015). Furthermore, shifting from sole crop rotation \ntoward\
    \ the diversified and integrating farming system is a \nvery accommodating approach\
    \ (Mohammadian et al., 2020).\nConservation Agriculture for Sustainability \n\
    in the Cropping System\nConservation agriculture can be a good adaptation option\
    \ \nto mitigate climate change. Conservation agriculture can \nenhance cropping\
    \ system performance in the long run \nthrough improvement in soil health and\
    \ biogeochemical \ncycles (Thierfelder et al., 2016), and it helps minimize the\
    \ \nuse of artificial nutrients thus reducing GHG emissions \n(Smith et al., 2019).\
    \ Rochecouste et al., (2015) reported \nabout the potential of conservation agriculture\
    \ practices \nto mitigate climate change. Similarly, Amin et al., (2020) \nreviewed\
    \ soil C management research to improve soil physio \nchemical features and recommended\
    \ application of social-\necological systems to offsets GHG emissions.\nCarbon\
    \ Sequestration\nSequestration of SOC is one of the utmost imperative oppor-\n\
    tunities for the reduction of GHGs and  CO2 production. By \nincreasing the carbon\
    \ quantity in the soil with the help of \nthe sustainable crop management practices,\
    \ we can diminish \nthe emission of  CO2 to the atmoshpere. Biochar applica-\n\
    tion can be useful for carbon sequestration and enhancement \nof organic carbon\
    \ stability in the soil under various crop-\nping systems (Newbold et al., 2015).\
    \ Olson et al., (2010) \nreported use of cover crops as potential sources to restore\
    \ \nSOC and soil productivity. Growing more trees could be \nhelpful to sequester\
    \ C through atmospheric fixation of  CO2 \ninto biomass. Therefore, it is suggested\
    \ that land kept for the \nplantation of trees or woody plants must not be utilized\
    \ or \nfor the other purposes. The burning of cotton sticks, wheat \nand rice\
    \ straw or stubbles must be stopped (Powlson et al., \n2016) since burning of\
    \ residues results in other problems \nsuch as smog, which can damage different\
    \ sectors of life. \nBurning residues is more common in rice growing regions \n\
    of India and Pakistan causing problems in both countries. \nThus, immediate, coordinated\
    \ action is needed on both sides \nof the border to prevent this problem and increase\
    \ SOC. \nSimilarly, to stop rice residue burning across the globe we \nshould\
    \ provide new technology for rice residue management. \nZero-tillage drills provide\
    \ a good option to sow wheat in \nstanding rice stubble but its higher cost and\
    \ accessibility to \nall are impediments to the adoption of this technology on\
    \ \na large scale. Powlson et al., (2011) emphasized the use of \ncrop residues\
    \ or animal manure to increase SOC that could \nhelp to revegetate degraded land\
    \ and minimize GHG emis-\nsions. However, they suggested use of other measures\
    \ such \nas reforestation and improving N use efficiency instead of \njust giving\
    \ more importance to C sequestration only in com-\nbating climate change.\nLong‑Term\
    \ Scenario Analysis\nFuture impacts of climate variability on all crops and crop-\n\
    ping systems could be studied by using crop growth models \nwith long-term scenario\
    \ analysis. Autret et al., (2020) did \nlong term modeling of crop yield, N losses\
    \ and GHG bal-\nance in organic cropping systems through the crop model \nSTICS.\
    \ The results showed that total N fertilization and total \nN gaseous loss as\
    \ well as N surplus and N storage have \nsignificant correlations among each other.\
    \ Metadata analy-\nsis can help to understand and address complex agricultural\
    \ \nsystems problems as reported by Kamilaris et al., (2017). \nSimilarly, model\
    \ scenarios help to study the impact of cli-\nmate extremes and pandemic like\
    \ Covid-19 on food systems \nthat can further explore global food shocks in response\
    \ to \nthese events (Sivakumar and Stefanski, (2011). Furthermore, \nlong term\
    \ analysis can also be used to study yield stability, \nenvironmental adaptability\
    \ and production risks of a spe-\ncific crop in the cropping system (Macholdt\
    \ et al., 2020). \nThe initiative as reported by CGIAR, where crop modeling \n\
    could be used for multiple purposes, is the best example \nof this approach. This\
    \ give real benefits at ground scale as \nit involves interdisciplinary approaches\
    \ to address multiple \nchallenges (Kruseman et al., 2020; Ramirez-Villegas et al.,\
    \ \n2020). Use of meta-analysis is a good approach to reach \nsolid conclusions\
    \ as reported in different earlier work about \nconservation agriculture, drought\
    \ and heat stress, irrigation, \nintercropping, alternate wetting and drying irrigation,\
    \ cli-\nmate change, climate change and adaptation,  [eCO2] and \nclimate warming\
    \ (Cohen et al., 2020).\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning \n\
    (ML)\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence could boost \nfarming system\
    \ productivity and efficiency (Eli-Chukwu, \n2019). These technologies can help\
    \ farmers reduce climate \nextreme impacts. AI and ML techniques could help to\
    \ detect \nextreme events such as drought and floods, disease occur-\nrence and\
    \ pest attack. AI and ML were used to advise farm-\ners what to anticipate. It\
    \ has been reported that AI brought a \nrevolution in agriculture (Talaviya et al.,\
    \ 2020). AI and ML \ntechnologies have been successfully implemented in such \n\
    agricultural management operations as irrigation, spraying, \n355\nInternational\
    \ Journal of Plant Production (2022) 16:341–363 \n1 3\ncrop monitoring and weeding\
    \ (Partel et al., 2019) through \nthe use of robots and drones. Thus, AI and ML\
    \ could help \nto save water and improve productivity and quality of crops. \n\
    Furthermore, future concerns of sustainable agriculture \ncould be addressed by\
    \ AI and ML (Elahi et al., 2019). AI \nand ML have been successfully applied in\
    \ precision agricul-\nture (Mahmud and He, 2020).\nModels to Develop Tools for Improved\
    \ Management \nof Subsistence Dryland Agricultural Systems\nProcess based mechanistic\
    \ models can be used to support \ndryland agricultural systems as these models\
    \ can identify \nyield gaps and suggest ways to minimize these gaps under \nalternative\
    \ scenarios. Similar suggestions about usage of \ntools were proposed by Lobell\
    \ et al., (2009) in which they \nreviewed the magnitude and cause of yield gaps\
    \ across \nthe globe. However, focusing on individual crop yields \ncould not\
    \ in itself bring sustainability to these systems, so \na whole farm approach\
    \ should be adopted to support the \nsystem. Agricultural systems modelling is\
    \ needed to quan-\ntify the benefits and trade-offs from alternative practices\
    \ at \nthe farm scale. Modeling has played, and will continue to \nplay, a significant\
    \ role in improving agriculture under dif-\nferent scenarios to feed the billions\
    \ of people across the \nworld (Rodriguez et al., 2014). Models can help to design\
    \ \nresilient farming systems under dryland agriculture by pro-\nviding knowledge\
    \ about functioning and dynamics of the \nsystems in interactions with biotic\
    \ and abiotic components, \nand then inform stakeholders how to manage their particu-\n\
    lar system. The Ricardian approach was used by Ochieng \net al., (2016) to study\
    \ the impacts of climate variability and \nchange on agricultural revenue of small-scale\
    \ farmers in \nKenya. Results showed that climate variability and change \nhave\
    \ significant effects on the livelihoods of small farm-\ners. Their findings further\
    \ indicated that temperature is a \nmuch more important indicator than rainfall,\
    \ and suggested \nimplementation of policies that prevent destruction of natu-\n\
    ral resources. These policies should also include crop insur-\nance and use of\
    \ integrated adaptation measures e.g. drought \ntolerant crop varieties, more\
    \ investment in agriculture and \napplication of sustainable management practices\
    \ (Ochieng \net al., 2016; Sequeros et al., 2021). Statistical matching and \n\
    econometric modeling were used to estimate how the cli-\nmate smart agriculture\
    \ technologies and practices impact \nhousehold income and asset accumulation\
    \ of small-scale \ndryland farmers in Kenya (Ogada et al., 2020). Results sug-\n\
    gested use of drought tolerant crops with an investment in \nlivestock could be\
    \ good adaption strategy to mitigate the \nimpact of climate variability and change.\
    \ Furthermore, it \nhad been suggested that crop canopy-based trait adaptation\
    \ \nstrategies (decrease the rate of canopy development in north-\nern locations\
    \ and increase the rate in southern locations) \ncould overcome constraints imposed\
    \ by rainfall variability \non water use efficiency (WUE) under dryland conditions\
    \ \n(Sadras & Rodriguez, 2007).\nDifferent process based dynamic crop modelling\
    \ tools \nare now available which could be used at a larger scale. \nThese include\
    \ APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems \nsIMulator), AquaCrop, CropSyst, CLM\
    \ (Community Land \nModel), DAISY, DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for \nAgrotechnology\
    \ Transfers), ECOSYS, HERMES, INFO-\nCROP, LINTUL (Light INTerception and UtiLisation),\
    \ \nSTICS (Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire pour les Cultures \nStandard) and RZWQM\
    \ (Root Zone Water Quality Model) \netc. APSIM is a well utilized model across\
    \ the globe to do \nmultiple tasks such as risk management, modelling Geno-\n\
    type (G) × Environment (E) × Management (M) Interactions \nin dryland agriculture\
    \ and modelling farms and farmers. \nUnder the sponsorship of APSIM initiative\
    \ a biophysical \nmodel CLEM (Crop Livestock Enterprise Model) has been \nreleased\
    \ to evaluate the impacts of management at the farm \nscale. Participatory modelling\
    \ is necessary to answer what-\nif scenarios so that these tools can be practically\
    \ used by \nfarmers and extension officers to achieve field-scale objec-\ntives.\
    \ Rodriguez and Sadras, (2011) tested the hypothesis \nthat plasticity in the\
    \ farming system could give options to \ntest new opportunities. Therefore, participatory\
    \ discussions \nand computer aided farming systems designs have proved \nuseful\
    \ for gaining insights into complex systems, generating \nawareness, and developing\
    \ strategies to solve problems at \nreal world scale. Further application of process-based\
    \ mod-\nels has been presented in Table SI. Meanwhile, success of \nsmallholder\
    \ farmers under climate shocks could be improved \nby the use of artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI), machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning methods in genomic prediction\
    \ \nmodels as reported by Consultative Group for International \nAgricultural\
    \ Research (CGIAR). Massive-scale genotyp-\ning and diversity analysis of 80,000\
    \ wheat accessions was \nconducted by Sansaloni et al., (2020). The main objective\
    \ \nof this work was to understand crop diversity for its use in \nfuture breeding\
    \ programs. Liakos et al., (2018) reviewed \nML as emerging big data science technology\
    \ that can help \nto improve farm system productivity. Furthermore, ML can \n\
    help to improve activities at farm scale by connecting ML \nto sensor data. Goldstein\
    \ et al., (2018) applied concepts of \nML on sensor data for irrigation management.\
    \ They sug-\ngested ML processes could be used for irrigation planning \nas well\
    \ as for yield and disease prediction. Furthermore, \nML and AI can be used for\
    \ gully erosion mapping (Tien \nBui et al., 2019), groundwater mapping (Arabameri\
    \ et al., \n2020), drip irrigation (Klyushin & Tymoshenko, 2021), \noptimization\
    \ of irrigation and application of pesticides and \nherbicides (Talaviya et al.,\
    \ 2020), dairy farm management \n(Cockburn, 2020; Shine et al., 2018), milk production\

    \ of suitable crop traits (Shekoofa et al., \n2014) and seasonal rainfall forecasting\
    \ (Feng et al., 2020; \nvan Ogtrop et al., 2014).\nFuture Research Focus\nFuture\
    \ research focus needs to be changed in such a way to \neliminate hunger on real\
    \ term basis. It has been reported in \nthe editorial of nature that among 570\
    \ million farms in the \nworld, more than 475 million are smaller than 2 hectares,\
    \ \nbut most of our research has prioritized larger farms, with-\nout giving sufficient\
    \ importance to small farming. Most of \nthe past research concludes that smallholders\
    \ can adapt to \nclimate change by adopting new approaches e.g. planting \nclimate-resilient\
    \ crops through extension services, which \nis not the case in reality. Similarly,\
    \ Ceres2030 sustainable \nsolutions to end hunger researchers found that most\
    \ past \nstudies are not relevant to the needs of smallholder farm-\ners (Laborde\
    \ et al., 2020). They also reported that most of \nthe reported studies did not\
    \ directly involve the farmers \n(Stathers et al., 2020). Furthermore, in the\
    \ past four dec-\nades funding priorities generally targeted big farms only. \n\
    Emphasis on small farms was less desirable in universities \nas well as by publishers\
    \ (Pardey et al., 2016). Since in most \nfunding where the private sector is involved,\
    \ rewards go to \nthose who can procure more research funding. However, to \n\
    achieve SDG, and to end hunger, we need to direct our future \nresearch more toward\
    \ smallholder farms.\nConclusions\nIn general, all farming systems are being negatively\
    \ affected \nby climate change and global warming, but dry land farming \nsystems\
    \ are particularly vulnerable. Resource use efficien-\ncies, yield and yield components\
    \ along with soil capabili-\nties are on the verge of irreparable losses unless\
    \ we adopt \neffective mitigation strategies. Thus, technology-based inter-\n\
    vention is needed to support agriculture of dryland farm-\ning systems. This support\
    \ will help to achieve sustainability \ndevelopment goals in the long run. The\
    \ negative impacts of \nclimate change on dry land farming systems can be mini-\n\
    mized by the quantification of impacts on the systems, by \nthe use of available\
    \ data sets with further analysis and by \nthe application of ‘what-if’ scenarios\
    \ using process-based \nmodels. By these means, benefits and tradeoffs can be\
    \ quan-\ntified under different sets of management practices on short \nterm as\
    \ well as on long term bases to develop tactics to \nreduce risk under extreme\
    \ climate conditions. This could \nfurther help to design adaptation and mitigation\
    \ strategies \nlike modification in the farming system matrix, introduc-\ntion\
    \ of legumes (microbial-based technologies), improve-\nment in varieties (water\
    \ efficient or drought/heat tolerant), \nappropriate crop management practices,\

    \ sensor network (WSN) applications in agriculture are\ndiscussed in the current\
    \ academic literature. On the basis of bibliometric techniques, 2444 publications\n\
    were extracted from the Scopus database and analyzed to identify the temporal\
    \ distribution of\nWSN research, the most productive journals, the most cited\
    \ authors, the most inﬂuential studies,\nand the most relevant keywords. The computer\
    \ program VOSviewer was used to generate the\nkeyword co-occurrence network and\
    \ partition the pertinent literature. Findings show the remarkable\ngrowth of\
    \ WSN research in recent years. The most relevant journals, cited countries, and\
    \ inﬂuential\nstudies were also identiﬁed. The main results from the keyword co-occurrence\
    \ clustering and the\ndetailed analysis illustrate that WSN is a key enabler for\
    \ precision agriculture. WSN research also\nfocuses on the role of other technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artiﬁcial\nintelligence, and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles in supporting several agriculture activities, including\n\
    smart irrigation and soil management. This study illuminates researchers’ and\
    \ practitioners’ views\nof what has been researched and identiﬁes possible opportunities\
    \ for future studies. To the authors’\nbest knowledge, this bibliometric study\
    \ represents the ﬁrst attempt to map global WSN research\nusing a comprehensive\
    \ sample of documents published over nearly three decades.\nKeywords: wireless\

    1. Introduction\nThe global population has witnessed considerable growth from\
    \ 2.5 billion in 1950\nto 7.8 billion today. It is estimated that the world population\
    \ will reach 9.7 billion by\n2050 [1]. As the most prominent food source, agriculture\
    \ has played a major role in human\ncivilization [2,3]. However, the exponential\
    \ increase in food demand due to population\ngrowth creates several pressing problems:\
    \ water and air pollution, greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, and global warming. These\
    \ issues, coupled with resource scarcity, accentuate the\nurgent need for adopting\
    \ novel and sustainable solutions [3–5]. Several researchers have\nincorporated\
    \ cutting-edge technologies to address these problems, including wireless sen-\n\
    sor networks (WSN) [6,7], the Internet of Things (IoT) [8–10], artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI)\ntechniques [11–13], spatial technologies [14], remote sensing [15,16],\
    \ computing technolo-\ngies [17–19], blockchain technology [20,21], big data [8,22],\
    \ and radio frequency identiﬁca-\ntion (RFID) [23]. These technologies gave birth\
    \ to smart and precision agriculture, which is\nestimated to reach $15.3 billion\
    \ in worth by 2025 [24].\nAs a collection of sensor nodes [25], WSN is of vital\
    \ importance due to its enabling\nrole in providing data for other layers and\
    \ technologies. Conceptually, WSN consists\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011. https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112011\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n\
    2 of 22\nof numerous smart battery-powered nodes connecting through a wireless\
    \ network. En-\nhancements in micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) make these\
    \ nodes smaller, less\nexpensive, and energy-efﬁcient. These nodes are distributed\
    \ across the ﬁeld and are respon-\nsible for collecting data from the farm and\
    \ environment. These various data include soil\nmoisture, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and crop conditions, to name a few. Furthermore, minor\nprocessing is enabled\
    \ by the microcontrollers built in these nodes. Data and information\nare transmitted\
    \ directly or indirectly to a base station or a hub. This results in considerable\n\
    improvements in the decision-making process [2,26,27]. The signiﬁcant beneﬁts\
    \ and capa-\nbilities WSN offer (e.g., monitoring, automation, optimization, etc.)\
    \ have prompted several\nscholars to investigate the potential of this technology\
    \ for agriculture. For example, [28]\nhighlighted the vital importance of WSN\
    \ in precision agriculture. The authors discuss the\nuse of different sensors\
    \ in sensing different parameters and the application of various com-\nmunication\
    \ technologies for data transmission. Thakur et al. [29] investigated the extant\n\
    literature and summarized the different WSN technologies for implementing precision\n\
    agriculture. The role of WSN in monitoring ﬁelds, optimizing irrigation, and measuring\n\
    temperature and soil property is also illustrated. Similarly, Refs. [30,31] explored\
    \ agricul-\ntural challenges and WSN solutions, including resources optimization,\
    \ decision-making\nsupport, land monitoring, and energy efﬁciency. Ruiz-Garcia\
    \ et al. [32] investigated the de-\nvelopments and applications of WSN and RFID\
    \ in agriculture. Aznoli and Navimipour [33]\nexplored the enabling strategies\
    \ as one of the most challenging aspects of incorporating\nWSN in agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, Refs. [2,26,34] were among a plethora of researchers who\nsynthesized\
    \ WSN research in the agricultural literature. Although these studies contribute\n\
    to the WSN ﬁeld from different perspectives, a structured systematic review based\
    \ on\na quantitative approach such as bibliometrics is still missing. Therefore,\
    \ guided by the\nstudy of [35], we aim to ﬁll this gap and examine the extant\
    \ literature surrounding WSN\napplications in the agriculture sector. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ in this investigation we attempt to\nseek answers to the following questions:\n\
    1.\nWhat are the publication dynamics on the interplay between WSN and agriculture?\n\
    2.\nHow is WSN being used in agriculture?\n3.\nWhat are the main research gaps\
    \ regarding WSN applications in agriculture?\nBy answering these questions, our\
    \ study provides signiﬁcant insights, exploring the\nentire ﬁeld of WSN applications\
    \ and its journey in the agriculture domain. The current\nstudy offers academicians\
    \ and practitioners a signiﬁcant understanding of the potential\nfor WSN in agriculture,\
    \ the current state of the literature, research hotspots, and future\nresearch\
    \ directions. This could advance their knowledge in the ﬁeld, identify research\
    \ gaps,\nand inform them of successful practices necessary to implement WSN in\
    \ agriculture.\nThe article proceeds as follows. Bibliometric approach and protocols\
    \ are discussed in\nSection 2. The main ﬁndings, including descriptive analysis,\
    \ keywords analysis, clustering\nanalysis, are explained in Section 3. Section\
    \ 4 discusses in detail the results of the keyword\nco-occurrence network. The\
    \ last section brieﬂy concludes the paper.\n2. Methodology\nAmong literature review\
    \ methodologies, bibliometric analysis is a powerful quantita-\ntive tool using\
    \ different measures to extract the behavior and dynamics of a knowledge\ndomain\
    \ [36–39]. We drew on best practices [38,40–42] to investigate in a comprehensive\n\

    \ databases\nwith the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed\
    \ research utilized by many\nscholars [43–45]. Figure 1 illustrates the research\
    \ process. Keywords including “wireless\nsensor network”, “WSN”, “agriculture”,\
    \ “farming”, “farmer*”, and “agricultural” were\nsearched in titles, abstracts,\

    \ Journal\n145\n36.25\nFour papers have received more than 400 citations. The\
    \ top-ranked paper, [58], inves-\ntigated the applications and design challenges\
    \ for wireless underground sensor networks\n(WUSNs), including soil and environmental\
    \ monitoring, problems of the underground\ncommunication channel, and challenges\
    \ at each layer of the communication protocol stack.\nThe second-most cited paper\
    \ explored the role of WSN and RFID in agriculture and the food\nsupply chain\
    \ [32]. The paper’s ﬁndings suggest that the agrifood industry could beneﬁt\n\
    from integrating these technologies in several ways, such as early warning in\
    \ emergencies\nand maintenance, energy efﬁciency, and cost efﬁciency. Furthermore,\
    \ [27] provided a com-\nprehensive review accompanied by global and Indian cases\
    \ about WSN potentials, applica-\ntions, architectures, different sensors, and\
    \ challenges in agriculture. Likewise, [2] explored\nthe WSN and wireless sensor\
    \ actor network (WSAN) applications in agriculture and\nbrought signiﬁcant insights.\
    \ These applications include irrigation, fertilization, pest control,\nanimal\
    \ and pasture monitoring, greenhouse, and viticulture.\nFurthermore, four papers\
    \ have achieved more than 50 citations per year. In the paper\nwith the most citations\
    \ per year, [4] argued that the enabling role of IoT in integrating\nseveral technologies,\
    \ including WSN, might represent a paradigm shift in the smart agri-\nculture\
    \ domain and could contribute to resource efﬁciency, food security, and productivity.\n\
    The third publication in terms of citations per year [49] emphasized the importance\
    \ of IoT\nin WSN and agriculture. Muangprathub et al. [49] developed a system\
    \ to optimize crop\nwatering based on WSN. The proposed system consisted of three\
    \ components: physical,\nweb application, and mobile application. The authors\
    \ also used data-mining techniques to\nenhance watering efﬁciency and efﬁcacy\
    \ for crop growth optimization.\n3.5. Keywords Dynamics—Authors versus Keywords\

    \ ranks\non both sides. Considering the authors’ side, researchers have studied\
    \ the importance of\ndifferent aspects of WSN in smart agriculture and greenhouse.\
    \ For instance, the primary\napplications of WSN in agriculture comprise environmental\
    \ monitoring, irrigation, and soil\nmoisture sensing. In addition, energy efﬁciency\
    \ is one of the most critical factors in design-\ning WSN applications, and it\
    \ can be achieved by several mechanisms such as clustering\nand routing protocols.\
    \ WSN telecommunication protocols and methods such as long range\nradio “LoRa”\
    \ and “Zigbee” are among the top ranks. Furthermore, the combination of\nWSN,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles “UAV”, and RIFD is beneﬁcial for agriculture monitoring\n\
    and tracking of agricultural goods from farm to market [23,67–71]. The keyword\
    \ “IoT”\nis ranked second, indicating the vital role of IoT in enhancing precision\
    \ agriculture and\nsmart farming by integrating several technologies, including\
    \ WSN and cloud computing.\nThe keywords plus mostly reinforce the authors’ keywords\
    \ with the various insights it\nprovided. Besides common keywords, the keywords\

    \ an analysis of abstract key-\nwords. Abstract keywords with high frequency are\
    \ illustrated in the treemap (see Figure 3).\nThe size of rectangles is proportional\
    \ to the frequency of the keywords. The larger the\nrectangle, the more frequently\

    To enrich previous analyses, we conducted trending topics analysis. We considered\n\
    authors’ keywords as the unit of analysis. The map was generated based on log\
    \ frequency.\nBy carrying out trending topics analysis, we depicted the evolution\
    \ of WSN applications\nin agriculture and their related emerging and hotspot topics,\
    \ as portrayed by Figure 4.\nWSN gained the most signiﬁcant attention in 2017\
    \ as one of the most important enablers\nof precision agriculture. In 2018, the\
    \ energy efﬁciency and security of WSN applications\nbecame a mainstream topic,\
    \ followed by developments in clustering and computing\ntechniques for improvements\
    \ in energy efﬁciency and performance in 2019. The most\ncritical keyword appearing\
    \ more frequently as a trending topic in 2019 was IoT due to\nits capability to\
    \ integrate multiple technologies with high efﬁciency and efﬁcacy. Various\ntechnologies\
    \ have become popular topics in this ﬁeld. We expect that the evolution and\n\
    utilization of complementary cutting-edge technologies will occur alongside WSN\
    \ in\nagriculture as time passes.\nAt the starting point of the analysis in 2010,\
    \ ubiquitous computing and informa-\ntion technologies (U-IT) became popular,\
    \ followed by the proliferation of open-source\nlightweight operation systems\
    \ (tinyOS) operating in 2011 and geospatial technologies,\nincluding GIS in 2011\
    \ and GPS in 2016. Moreover, RFID for products, livestock, and agricul-\nture\

    \ of Research Foci\nWe adopted keywords co-occurrence analysis among various clustering\
    \ techniques\nsuch as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling [73,74].\
    \ Although all these\ntechniques are powerful methods to identify different paradigms\
    \ in a research domain,\nthe method was conducted ﬁrst to enrich the previous\
    \ keywords analyses and, second,\nbecause the method enables us to extract the\
    \ actual content of publications [43]. Keyword\nco-occurrence analysis provides\
    \ insights into various research foci that contribute to the\ndevelopment of knowledge\
    \ at the intersection of WSN and agriculture. This relational\nbibliometric method\
    \ ﬁnds the author keywords (unit of analysis) that have appeared in\narticles\
    \ simultaneously. It sets the more frequent ones as clusters. As a result, scholars\n\
    could gain important insights about knowledge divergence and different paradigms\
    \ at\nthe intersection of WSN and agriculture [39,75]. To generate the network,\
    \ we started by\nextracting authors’ keywords in selected papers and reﬁning them\
    \ when necessary. For\ninstance, the full-length keywords were abbreviated (e.g.,\
    \ the phrase Wireless Sensor and\nActuator Network was replaced with WSAN). Next,\
    \ the resulting data were imported to\nVOSviewer. The network was constructed\
    \ by conducting density-based spatial clustering\nbased on the full counting method\
    \ [76]. The minimum number of keyword co-occurrence\nwas set at ﬁve, which makes\
    \ ﬁndings different if this cutoff is lower or higher than this\nvalue (see Table\
    \ 6). For instance, too low a cutoff value may result in a large number of\nclusters\
    \ in the network, which does not provide a clear view of the research topics focused\n\
    upon and entails some degree of subjectivity in regard to which clusters should\
    \ be included\nin the keyword co-occurrence analysis [77]. However, too high a\
    \ cutoff value may lead to\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n10 of 22\nonly a few\
    \ keywords being clustered, which reduces the representativeness and reliability\n\
    of the clustering outcomes [78]. Therefore, to obtain a meaningful visualization,\
    \ a cutoff\nvalue of ﬁve recommended by prior studies [79–81] was applied in our\
    \ review to obtain\na manageable number of clusters for the analysis [78]. Accordingly,\
    \ a network with ﬁve\nclusters was generated (see Figure 5). In the ﬁgure, each\
    \ node represents a keyword, and\nthe size of the node is proportional to its\
    \ frequency. The color of nodes indicates cluster\nmembership for the keywords.\
    \ Table 7 presents the top ten most frequent keywords in each\ncluster. In the\
    \ subsequent sections, we support our bibliometric analysis with a qualitative\n\
    review of WSN-related studies to provide in-depth details to the results of the\
    \ keyword\nco-occurrence network. More speciﬁcally, we discuss the studies addressing\
    \ the content of\nidentiﬁed clusters. The analysis of each cluster offers valuable\
    \ insights into existing and\nemerging themes within WSN research in the agriculture\
    \ context.\nTable 6. Keyword clustering parameters.\nType of Analysis\nKeyword\

    Table 7 reveals that cluster 1 revolves around the critical role of WSN in precision\n\
    agriculture. The most important keywords in this cluster are “WSN”, “Precision\
    \ Agricul-\nture”, “Zigbee”, and “Agriculture”. As a promising technology in precision\
    \ agriculture,\nWSN is expected to modernize data collection in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld and support the\nautomation of agriculture systems, which necessitate intensive\
    \ sensing of environmental\ncircumstances at the ground level [82]. The increasing\
    \ use of WSN applications in precision\nagriculture enhances the efﬁciency and\
    \ productivity of different agricultural production\nsystems. According to [83],\
    \ farmers could gain additional insights about their ﬁelds and\nidentify their\
    \ best solution by utilizing WSN. Elijah et al. [4] posit that the ability of\
    \ WSN\nto self-organize, self-conﬁgure, self-diagnose, and self-heal has made\
    \ the technology an\nexcellent alternative for smart agriculture. WSN can be used\
    \ to collect data related to\nsoil moisture, weather temperature, control irrigation\
    \ processes, and support farming\ndecision-making [51]. Therefore, the basic aim\
    \ of WSN adoption in agriculture is data\ncollection, environmental monitoring,\
    \ and data analysis [28,29].\nScholars have developed several protocols for sensor\
    \ nodes communication and WSN\nimplementation, including Zigbee, Bluetooth, and\
    \ Wi-Fi. As one of the most suitable\ntools for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ Zigbee facilitates irrigation supervision, water\nquality management, and fertilizer\
    \ and pesticide monitoring, all of which need a cyclic\ninformation update [51].\
    \ Because of its energy-efﬁcient, ﬂexible, reliable, and affordable\nwireless\
    \ protocol, Zigbee simpliﬁes the monitoring of a wide variety of environmental\n\
    conditions, including soil health, weed-disease detection, crop growth, and agricultural\n\
    product quality [84]. Precision agriculture is a well-suited ﬁeld for the integration\
    \ of\nZigbee. For example, [85] developed an intelligent irrigation system based\
    \ on the Zigbee\nnetwork protocol. In this system, the sensor node involves soil\
    \ moisture sensors that aim\nto control the water level in the soil, while the\
    \ actuator node is meant to take actions\nconsidering the soil’s water level.\
    \ Zigbee also shows advantages in protected agriculture\ndue to its capability\
    \ to overcome the limitations of wire connection and facilitate greenhouse\nmanagement\
    \ development [86]. Incorporating Zigbee-based WSN systems is a step forward\n\
    in the automation and efﬁciency of greenhouse environment monitoring and control\
    \ since\nthey can be easily maintained [87]. The climate conditions of greenhouses\
    \ (e.g., humidity,\ntemperature, light, and air pressure) can be monitored and\
    \ controlled in real-time owing\nto WSN, thereby optimizing plant growth, increasing\
    \ yield production, and mitigating\nharmful disasters in farms [51]. Greenhouses\
    \ could greatly beneﬁt from the low power\nconsumption and long communication\
    \ range of WSN to monitor and predict the health\nof plants, ensure adequate supply\
    \ of nutrients, and provide a cost-effective approach for\nprecision agriculture\
    \ in greenhouses [88].\nWith high similarity with WSN, RFID is another wireless\
    \ sensor technology that\nhas gained scholars’ attention [32]. It is developed\
    \ for identifying, categorizing, and\ntracking the ﬂow of goods [5]. As such,\
    \ RFID simpliﬁes the tracking of agricultural\nproducts [5], irrigation facilities\
    \ management [89], and wireless real-time communication\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 12011\n12 of 22\nwith agriculture sensors (e.g., soil temperature sensors)\
    \ [55]. Furthermore, RFID tags\nprovide energy harvesting capabilities because\
    \ the power of the radio-frequency ﬁeld\ncan exceed what the tag requires for\
    \ its operation [23]. In agriculture, energy harvesting\nis crucial to extend\
    \ the lifetime of sensor nodes [51] and improve the performance of\nWSN-based\
    \ systems [27]. When powered by energy harvesting, WSN can contribute\nto developing\
    \ more sustainable agricultural systems that increase farming productivity\nand\
    \ efﬁciency.\nWhile the importance of WSN in supporting precision agriculture\
    \ has been widely rec-\nognized in the academic literature, several knowledge\
    \ gaps can be usefully addressed in fu-\nture studies. For instance, more focus\
    \ should be placed on designing more energy-efﬁcient\nsensors to reduce the cost\
    \ of wireless systems and improve the accuracy and efﬁciency\nof farming operations\
    \ [90]. One research direction worth examining is the improvement\nof quality\
    \ of service (QoS) of WSNs in terms of maintenance and implementation costs,\n\
    coverage, reliability, and energy consumption. This is crucial as the shift from\
    \ traditional\nagriculture to precision agriculture requires accuracy, easily\
    \ conﬁgurable topology designs,\nand appropriate hardware and software for coping\
    \ with ﬁeld environments [91,92]. In\naddition, the integration of WSN in agriculture\
    \ may necessitate the effective management\nand control of a large number of sensors\
    \ through reliable connectivity and with a simple\nconﬁguration [93]. Moving forward\
    \ within this direction means that future studies will\nhave to identify the topologies,\
    \ conﬁgurations, and communication protocols of WSNs that\nshould be considered\
    \ in different agriculture scenarios. Future research also needs to inves-\ntigate\
    \ WSN system viability and how they achieve agriculture sustainability considering\n\
    their long-term impacts on economic, environmental, and social dimensions.\n4.2.\
    \ Potentials of IoT, Cloud Computing, and AI for Agriculture\nThe second cluster\
    \ (shown in green) indicates the critical role of IoT and other comple-\nmentary\
    \ technologies in enhancing WSN implementation in agriculture. IoT has altered\
    \ the\noperation modes of agriculture and increased agricultural automation [4,5,94].\
    \ According\nto [95], IoT facilitates crop monitoring, optimizes agricultural\
    \ productivity, and increases\nfarmers’ proﬁtability. IoT provides a platform\
    \ to maintain real-time data and alert farmers\nto take necessary actions. Furthermore,\
    \ with the support of IoT sensors across farms,\nfarmers can obtain an abundance\
    \ of useful data, including soil, water, and temperature.\nIoT’s ability to act\
    \ as a framework to integrate several technologies, including wireless\nsensor\
    \ and actuator networks (WSANs), AI techniques and methods (e.g., ANN and ML),\n\
    computing technologies (e.g., cloud computing), UAVs, geospatial technologies,\
    \ end-user\napplications, among many others have recently gained scholars’ attention\
    \ [4,5,49,96]. Key-\nwords such as “cloud computing”, “LoRa”, “ML”, “ANN” are\
    \ therefore included in this\ncluster. Coupled with WSN, cloud computing offers\
    \ high-quality services, hardware-\nagnostic application tools, and sufﬁcient\
    \ storage capacity and computational resources\nto maintain and process the data\
    \ generated at the network [5]. Furthermore, cloud com-\nputing helps to overcome\
    \ the weaknesses of WSNs owing to its ability to offer open,\nmore ﬂexible, and\
    \ reconﬁgurable applications for monitoring and controlling agricultural\nprocesses\
    \ [97]. Similarly, cloud-based agriculture systems could be utilized to develop\
    \ a\nreliable architecture for farmers to gain timely and on-the-spot data via\
    \ WSN [98].\nThe contribution of LoRa to agriculture is also highlighted in the\
    \ literature. As such,\nLoRa represents one of the popular modulation techniques\
    \ that could be implemented in\nagriculture [99,100]. Owing to its long range,\
    \ LoRa supports irrigation and several precision\nagriculture applications and\
    \ enables wireless communication to remote ﬁelds [101]. LoRa\ncan be adequately\
    \ utilized in vast agricultural ﬁelds. Combined with LoRa transceivers,\nWSN can\
    \ augment sustainability in agriculture by equipping farmers with insightful and\n\
    usable data [102]. While the deployment of WSN generates massive and various data,\n\
    there is a need to process and make use of these data in agriculture. In this\
    \ regard, machine\nlearning is a useful technique that could be applied to the\
    \ data generated by WSN, thereby\nperforming predictions in agriculture. These\
    \ include estimations of available water for\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n\
    13 of 22\nirrigation [101], nutrients [4], and plant growth [103]. As another\
    \ AI technique, ANN is\nalso demonstrated useful to reinforce the predictive capabilities\
    \ of farmers. ANN can use\nagriculture data collected by IoT sensors to select\
    \ crop varieties and predict their production\nrate [104], estimate the levels\
    \ of phosphorus in the soil [105], and support decision-making\nprocesses [106].\n\
    Summarizing, the literature on the possibilities of these technologies is rich,\
    \ and\nseveral opportunities for future research exist. For example, scholars\
    \ need to investigate\nhow IoT and WSN can be applied in protected agriculture\
    \ to reduce human intervention,\nsave energy, and maximize efﬁciency in ﬁeld monitoring.\
    \ Examination of the methods\nand solutions to secure agriculture data is necessary\
    \ to ensure that WSN becomes a re-\nsilient, safe, and trustable network. In the\
    \ context of cloud computing, further studies are\nrequired to understand the\
    \ role of this technology to bring ﬁnancially economical agricul-\ntural systems\
    \ [107] and enhance their technical properties, including scalability, efﬁciency,\n\
    storage capacity, and overall performance [108]. To further accelerate the transition\
    \ toward\ndata-driven agriculture, the development of more precise, accurate,\
    \ and efﬁcient machine\nlearning algorithms constitutes an intriguing opportunity\
    \ for future research. This is crucial\nas farmers can rely on machine learning\
    \ to extract insights from the data-intensive pro-\ncesses and support decision-making\
    \ in farming operational environments. As a popular AI\ntool, scholars also need\
    \ to examine the contributions of ANN at each stage of agricultural\nproduction\
    \ and how this technology can solve relevant tasks and pending issues in the\n\
    agriculture sector.\n4.3. Potentials of Clustering and UAVs for Agriculture\n\
    Energy efﬁciency and consumption are the main research foci of the third (blue)\
    \ cluster.\nCurrently, there are extensive debates about energy consumption, resource\
    \ limitation, and\nglobal warming at the global level [109–111]. WSN and other\
    \ enabling technologies could\ncontribute massively to energy efﬁciency in agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Table 7, the high\noccurrence of “Sensor Network”, “Clustering”,\
    \ and “Energy Efﬁciency” reveals that the\neffective utilization of resources\
    \ is of paramount importance in agriculture. To maintain the\nstability of WSNs,\
    \ clustering could be used to collect data from sensor nodes, achieve energy\n\
    efﬁciency, and prevent channel contention and packet collision [112]. Clustering\
    \ is vital to\nprolong the lifetime of sensor networks and respond to the needs\
    \ of precision agriculture,\nwhich requires advanced methods and technologies\
    \ to minimize costs and maximize\nproductivity [113]. To solve the energy consumption\
    \ of sensors and WSN in general,\nseveral researchers developed various initiatives,\
    \ including DEC routing protocol [114],\nmobile data collector routing protocol\
    \ [115], MAC protocol [116], clustering technique [117],\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocol [118], LEACH protocol [119], localization and clustering\ntechniques\
    \ [120], among many others.\nFurthermore, agriculture implies large-scale monitoring,\
    \ which can beneﬁt from the\nmerge of WSN and UAVs. For instance, [121] argue\
    \ that UAVs can be a good alternative\nfor demanding activities that need long\
    \ observation periods, multiple sensors, data man-\nagement, long-term stability,\
    \ energy and computational resources, and high temporal and\nspatial resolution.\
    \ With the evolution of UAVs and vehicular networks, WSNs can gain\nadditional\
    \ functionalities because UAVs make some nodes dynamic and collect data and\n\
    maintain wireless communication in areas lacking ﬁxed communication infrastructure\
    \ [122].\nThrough navigation data and the waypoints produced by the ground station,\
    \ UAVs could\nautonomously navigate the targeted waypoints and collect ﬁeld image\
    \ data [123]. UAVs are\nalso equipped with the necessary features to capture the\
    \ required images, map the ﬁelds,\nand detect pests, diseases, or water stress\
    \ on the crops [124]. By leveraging their software\nand hardware, UAV activities\
    \ (e.g., pesticide spraying) can be monitored by means of the\nfeedback from WSN\
    \ placed at the ground level in speciﬁed locations on the agriculture\nﬁeld [125].\
    \ Nevertheless, the performance of UAVs rests on the routing protocol applied.\n\
    For example, geographic routing protocols, which offer high mobility networks\
    \ and high\nperformance with large UAVs, could boost UAV navigation capability.\
    \ Meanwhile, energy-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n14 of 22\nware routing protocols\
    \ and those requiring ample space are more suitable for improving\nUAV power capability\
    \ and storage capacity [126].\nWith the design of more energy-efﬁcient algorithms\
    \ for WSNs, there is an urgent\nneed to propose clustering methods that can use\
    \ available resources in agriculture WSNs\nmore efﬁciently, thereby extending\
    \ network lifetime and increasing energy efﬁciency. The\ninvestigation of how\
    \ to optimize the performance of UAVs when WSNs are used as a\nsource of information\
    \ is encouraged for future studies. This is important as after applying\nthe chemicals\
    \ by the UAV, [127] discovered that some areas of the crop did not have enough\n\
    chemicals due to speed and wind direction. As a result, the effective development\
    \ of WSN-\nbased agriculture systems with mobile nodes (i.e., sensors mounted\
    \ on UAVs) and UAVs\nrequire the deployment of lightweight software, the implementation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\nrouting protocols, and the minimization of data transferred\
    \ from WSN to UAVs.\n4.4. Development of Smart Irrigation\nThe yellow cluster\
    \ presents the WSNs’ role in developing smart irrigation systems.\nOn the one\
    \ hand, water is a scarce resource necessary for the sustainability of the earth\
    \ and\nhuman beings that need to be preserved [128]. On the other hand, water\
    \ is a necessary input\nfor agriculture productivity that should be managed to\
    \ ensure optimal crop yields [129].\nWSNs are one of the most promising solutions\
    \ that can be applied to develop smart\nirrigation systems [26]. Sensors distributed\
    \ across the ﬁeld and connected through a\nwireless network could provide more\
    \ detailed and accurate information about soil moisture,\nhumidity, temperature,\
    \ and other critical indicators compared to old wired methods. This\ninformation\
    \ could be utilized to automate irrigation and improve precision agriculture\n\
    practices [32]. In other words, each part of the land will receive the necessary\
    \ optimum\namount of water based on the real-time data that WSN provides. WSN\
    \ facilitates irrigation\nmanagement and rescheduling by automating access to\
    \ inﬁeld soil moisture status and\ncontrolling irrigation, maximizing the efﬁcient\
    \ utilization of water, and improving crop\nproduction [33].\nMicrocontroller-based\
    \ gateways could be used to control the quantity of water [130].\nMicrocontrollers\
    \ are essential in agriculture because they can convert analog data to\ndigital\
    \ data and provide automation and digital remote access capability [131]. Equally,\n\
    GSM technology could be used to share the data and information with farmers [132].\n\
    Hence, farmers could optimize their crop yields and water usage simultaneously.\
    \ The\nresearchers in this cluster are interested in WSN’s role in developing\
    \ smart irrigation\nsystems. They explored how better monitoring systems utilizing\
    \ wireless sensors should\nbe developed to provide helpful information (e.g.,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature) based\non different communication (e.g., GSM)\
    \ and computing (e.g., Atmeag328P microcontroller)\ntechnologies for irrigation\
    \ automation and efﬁciency [26,29,133]. For example, Giri and\nPippal, [130] develop\
    \ an automated irrigation system based on WSN and GPRS, [134]\ndesign a system\
    \ based on WSN and GPRS/GSM network to monitor soil and irrigation\nwater and\
    \ optimize water consumption, and [135] utilize WSN for promoting a site-speciﬁc\n\
    precision irrigation system.\nThe cost of implementing WSN-based irrigation systems\
    \ may not be affordable to\nsmall and budget-constrained farmers; thus, future\
    \ research should investigate the techni-\ncal and economic factors that explain\
    \ the acceptance of these systems in the agriculture\nsector [124]. Additionally,\
    \ scholars not only could contribute to research surrounding water\nmanagement\
    \ by optimizing water use via the implementation of novel technologies such\n\
    as WSN, IoT, AI, and computing technologies [136–138], but they could also concentrate\n\
    on alternative water resources such as graywater, drainage water, and recycled\
    \ wastewa-\nter [139], or developing various irrigation methods such as ﬂood irrigation,\
    \ spray irrigation,\ndrip irrigation, and nebulizer irrigation [124].\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 12011\n15 of 22\n4.5. Soil Management\nThe last (purple) cluster deals\
    \ with the critical role of WSN in enhancing soil manage-\nment. The vital importance\
    \ of soil property and conditions in agriculture is undeniable.\nAny advancement\
    \ in soil monitoring and management is a key factor in improving resource\nefﬁciency,\
    \ optimizing irrigation, maximizing crop yields, and minimizing environmental\n\
    effects [140,141]. WSN has the potential to play a vital role in soil management\
    \ because\nof its capability to handle huge amounts of data regarding different\
    \ soil attributes [34].\nWith WSN, soil data are sensed and gathered continuously.\
    \ Sensor nodes could perform\nminor processing, and the data and information are\
    \ sent to the base station for further\nanalysis. The resulting insightful information\
    \ could be utilized to measure the needs of\ncrops, determine the schedules (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation), and overall improve decision-making and\nproductivity [29]. To\
    \ be more speciﬁc, sensor nodes could be implemented to assess the\nsuitability\
    \ of the farmland for cultivation [82], analyze the spatiotemporal variation of\
    \ soil\ntemperature [142], and monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture\
    \ in real-time in\ngreenhouses [143]. Furthermore, sensor nodes could monitor\
    \ soil physical and biochemical\nattributes to increase productivity and decrease\
    \ environmental footprint [144]. Sensor\nnodes also could measure, monitor, and\
    \ integrate various soil quality parameters [145];\nautomate irrigation through\
    \ humidity, temperature, and pH sensors [133]; and measure\nsoil resistivity [146].\n\
    While academicians and practitioners are increasingly studying WSN’s potential\n\
    for soil management practices, future research needs to address some challenges\
    \ and\nresearch gaps. For example, improving sensing performance and reliability,\
    \ enhancing\nenergy efﬁciency, data processing capability of sensor nodes and\
    \ wireless communication,\ndeveloping energy-independent sensors [141], and improving\
    \ power sources [34] are\nimportant research areas. In addition, future work should\
    \ scrutinize the minimum number\nof sensor nodes required to minimize the overall\
    \ cost of WSN deployment in agriculture\nand achieve acceptable sensing accuracy\
    \ of soil.\n5. Conclusions\n5.1. Discussion of Findings\nThe main goal of this\
    \ study was to synthesize WSN applications in the agriculture\nsector and advance\
    \ the existing literature by highlighting several knowledge gaps for future\n\
    research. Using a bibliometric analysis and qualitative review of selected publications,\n\
    we determine the most important topics in existing research and unravel emerging\
    \ and\nprospective avenues for future research. To perform the analysis, a set\
    \ of 2444 papers was\nchosen and considered for the ﬁnal review. The review ﬁndings\
    \ can be useful to scholars\nactively examining WSN within the context of agriculture.\
    \ Despite the growing literature\non WSN, there is still a scarcity of publications\
    \ providing a holistic view of the future\ndevelopments of WSN in agriculture,\
    \ broadening the understanding of the subject and\nbridging this knowledge gap.\
    \ Therefore, our investigation attempted to achieve this by\nidentifying various\
    \ topics and research foci at the nexus of WSN and agriculture. Several\nrelevant\
    \ insights can be obtained from this review. First, the number of publications\n\
    dealing with WSN applications in agriculture has remarkably increased during 2002–2021.\n\
    The journal-wise distribution of WSN-related publications indicated that Sensors,\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Communications, and IEEE Sensors Journal are the major outlets\
    \ contributing to\nthe WSN and agriculture literature. Our study highlights the\
    \ relevance of these journals\nand their role in advancing WSN applications in\
    \ agriculture over time. Regarding the\nworldwide impact, Asian countries were\
    \ the most cited. The current review draws several\nexciting insights concerning\
    \ the role of WSN to support agriculture operations and increase\nthe efﬁciency\
    \ of farming processes. From this perspective, we identiﬁed the most globally\n\
    cited papers (see Table 4). As per these publications, WSN applications are striving\
    \ to\nestablish an efﬁcient and sustainable agriculture sector and respond to\
    \ precision agriculture\nneeds. WSN technologies garnered signiﬁcant attention\
    \ and gained momentum due to\ntheir ability to increase farmers’ understanding\
    \ of crop conditions, resource use, and\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n16 of\
    \ 22\nenvironmental circumstances, which would otherwise be challenging to capture.\
    \ Another\nbeneﬁt of WSN consists in automating ﬁeld operations, maximizing crop\
    \ yields, enhancing\nfood quality and safety, and increasing sustainability. As\
    \ a result, farmers can rely on\nthe technology to support their decision-making\
    \ procedures, reduce human intervention,\nimprove prediction accuracy, and decrease\
    \ pesticide use.\nBy analyzing the keyword dynamics, our research found that WSN,\
    \ IoT, Zigbee, RFID,\nUAV, and cloud computing are some of the common technologies\
    \ explored in the context\nof agriculture. WSN represents a signiﬁcant enabler\
    \ for precision agriculture since it helps\ncollect, monitor, and analyze data\
    \ from agriculture [28]. Similarly, WSN combines IoT\nsensors to interconnect,\
    \ thereby sensing real-time soil and climate conditions [147] and\nautomating\
    \ irrigation. IoT, clustering, RFID, and UAV are crucial enablers for establishing\n\
    smarter and more sustainable agriculture, beneﬁting farmers and consumers. Aside\
    \ from\nmirroring the progress of digitization, the identiﬁed themes illustrate\
    \ that WSN applications\nin agriculture are growing dramatically. However, despite\
    \ the extensive research on WSN,\nit is crucial to highlight the dearth of studies\
    \ investigating the convergence of WSN and\nother embryonic technologies such\
    \ as blockchain, 5G, augmented reality, and vertical farms.\nIntegrating these\
    \ technological developments enables farmers to perform more efﬁciently\nand innovatively;\
    \ nonetheless, the pending question remains how these solutions inﬂuence\nnegatively.\
    \ Therefore, our review results uncover and emphasize the urgent need for more\n\
    research investigating how WSN can reshape farming policies and achieve holistic\
    \ and\ninclusive sustainability in agriculture supply chains.\n5.2. Research Implications\n\
    This study offers insights for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers\
    \ to better\ngrasp the applications of WSN in agriculture and draw their attention\
    \ to scholarly output,\nresearch foci, and prospects for ﬂourishing WSN systems\
    \ in farming operations. Our\nstudy is useful for scholars attempting to increase\
    \ their understanding of what has been\nresearched to date in WSN and agriculture\
    \ and what needs further examination. In this\nrespect, the relevant ﬁndings from\
    \ employing the keyword co-occurrence clustering are the\npredominant themes from\
    \ the past literature on WSN applications in precision agriculture,\nIoT, cloud\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence, UAVs, smart irrigation, and soil management.\n\
    By taking advantage of these technologies, farmers can shift toward smarter agriculture\n\
    and make existing farming systems more robust, sophisticated, and efﬁcient. To\
    \ illuminate\nresearchers’ views on WSN-related topics, seminal works in the literature\
    \ can be built\nupon to comprehend the entire ﬁeld and uncover the hot and neglected\
    \ areas of WSN\nresearch in agriculture. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of research\
    \ foci and topics was\nmade through analyzing the keyword co-occurrence network.\
    \ Based on the generated\nclusters, the core content of WSN research and knowledge\
    \ gaps were discovered. The\nthree thematic hotspots in the WSN literature essentially\
    \ focus on various technologies,\nincluding IoT, AI, UAV, RFID, and cloud computing.\
    \ The review ﬁndings indicate that\nWSN is not a standalone technology; instead,\
    \ it combines diverse hardware and software\ntechnologies to improve agriculture.\
    \ The relationships among the key topics also ascertain\nthe essentiality of WSN\
    \ deployment in agriculture and the potential of the technology to\noffer more\
    \ efﬁcient agri-food processes. As a result, researchers, farmers, and practitioners\n\
    must work hard to improve the interoperability of WSN-based agriculture systems\
    \ and\ndevise appropriate and responsive practices and measures.\nOverall, the\
    \ present study leverages a new approach to systematize WSN research\nin the context\
    \ of agriculture, using techniques derived from bibliometrics to reach an\nobjective\
    \ and quantitative evaluation of the current state of WSN literature. To the authors’\n\
    knowledge, no exclusive and comprehensive review of WSN research exists so far,\
    \ albeit\nthe mounting interest in the technology and its critical role in promoting\
    \ more efﬁcient\nand sustainable agricultural practices. Our analysis of the present\
    \ status of this research\ndomain and knowledge gaps may favor the development\
    \ of new studies and contribute to\nthe global scholarly production on WSN and\
    \ agriculture.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n17 of 22\n5.3. Limitations and\
    \ Future Research Directions\nDespite its signiﬁcant contributions, this review\
    \ has some shortcomings that need to\nbe considered when interpreting the ﬁndings.\
    \ One of the main shortcomings is that we only\nchose publications from a single\
    \ scientiﬁc database, Scopus. Although Scopus is regarded as\na source of publications,\
    \ further research may consider other alternative scientiﬁc databases\nsuch as\
    \ the Web of Science to extend our review ﬁndings by providing additional insights,\n\
    research trends, and other theoretical perspectives. Moreover, the literature\
    \ clustering via\nkeyword co-occurrence network can be supplemented by other bibliometric\
    \ techniques\nsuch as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling to\
    \ generate additional\ninsights. Finally, as discussed in each cluster, we identiﬁed\
    \ various research gaps to address\nWSN applications in agricultural practices.\
    \ Energy efﬁciency in all parts of the system\nfrom design to sensors to communication\
    \ and clustering protocols, implementation and\nmaintenance costs, various technologies’\
    \ integration and their complementarities, social\nimpacts and environmental footprints,\
    \ and WSN systems’ viability and reliability are\namong the exciting topics for\
    \ further research.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.R. and A.A.; methodology,\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\
    \ conceived the study idea and \ndeveloped the analysis plan. R.M. and S.W. analyzed\
    \ the data \nand wrote the initial paper.  \nM.N.H. helped to prepare the figures\
    \ and tables and \nfinalizing the manuscript. R.M. completed the final editing\
    \ \nand figures of the manuscript. All authors read the manuscript. \nREFERENCES\

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits

    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.

    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ into a wide range of modern\nIoT applications. The growing number of networked\
    \ IoT devices generates a large amount of data.\nHowever, processing and memorizing\
    \ this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed\ncritical challenges,\
    \ especially when using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit\n\
    valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged\
    \ as a way to bring\ncloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to\
    \ address computation-intensive ofﬂoading\nand latency issues. This paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works\nrelated to UAV technology\
    \ applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details\n\
    the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications\
    \ and the role of\nboth deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting\
    \ various limitations related to latency,\ntask ofﬂoading, energy demand, and\
    \ security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains\nan insight\
    \ into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges\
    \ to be\ntackled when using AI.\nKeywords: UAVs; IoT; cloud computing; edge computing;\
    \ MEC; AI; review\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is constantly\
    \ expanding to cover many ﬁelds\nand applications. IoT devices present many beneﬁts\
    \ for improving services in a broad\nrange of contexts. The number of connected\
    \ devices is forecasted to reach impressive\nheights in the coming years. According\
    \ to CISCO, more than 70 billion devices will be\nconnected by the end of 2025\
    \ [1,2]. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically\nknown as drones,\
    \ have attracted considerable attention from academia and industrial\ncommunities\
    \ due to their excellent capabilities and attractive features. They promise to\n\
    bring an ideal contribution to the ﬁeld of IoT, based on their unique characteristics.\
    \ They\noffer elastic and ﬂexible mobile features, as required in many omnipresent\
    \ IoT applications,\nmaking their integration into wireless network communication\
    \ easy and feasible.\nMoreover, integrating embedded intelligent devices such\
    \ as cameras and sensors on\nUAVs offer many advantages when monitoring hostile\
    \ and unreachable environments.\nIn addition, they can potentially provide many\
    \ services in the context of modern IoT\ninterconnection, such as smart cities,\
    \ smart farming, smart factories, smart grids, and\nintelligent transportation.\
    \ The development of communication protocols and networks\nhas also improved the\
    \ tracking and maneuverability of drones to cover many application\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as their contribution as a critical component of the communication\n\
    network [3]. UAVs can also guarantee reliable connectivity in hostile areas with\
    \ limited\nDrones 2021, 5, 148. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5040148\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n2 of 30\nor unavailable communication infrastructure. Typically,\
    \ UAVs can be deployed as aided\ncommunication networks by integrating them into\
    \ the peripheral network as ﬂying base\nstations (BSs) [4,5], relay nodes [6],\
    \ or terminal nodes [7]. Therefore, they act primarily as a\nmeans of enabling\
    \ ﬂexible communication services in remote areas when interconnections\nwith existing\
    \ networks are lost. To this end, UAVs can be used in edge-computing (EC),\nfog-computing\
    \ (FC), and as crucial equipment in cellular networks [8].\nIoT networks enable\
    \ comprehensive connectivity for many mobile users by enabling\nvarious emerged\
    \ application services (e.g., automatic surveillance, unmanned control\nvehicles\
    \ and object recognition). Centralized servers, such as cloud computing (CC)\n\
    facilities and data centers, generally process and analyze the generated data\
    \ by carrying out\ncomputational intelligence based on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI). These centralized systems\nare quick to deploy, inexpensive to maintain,\
    \ and practical when data need to be centrally\ncontrolled. However, they are\
    \ mostly constrained by their high failure rate, security risks\nand access delay.\
    \ Data processing at the central level causes considerable time delays that\n\
    affect the overall system quality of service (QoS), especially regarding the response-time\n\
    requirement for latency-sensitive applications. Decentralized and distributed\
    \ systems have\nemerged to solve the issue of centralized system constraints.\
    \ The decentralized system relies\non servers that are supposed to store a copy\
    \ of the resources. Users in distributed systems\nhave equal access to data, yet\
    \ user rights can be enabled as necessary, and data ownership\ncan be shared efﬁciently.\
    \ Hardware and software resources are also allocated between\nusers, increasing\
    \ truthfulness, reducing component failure, and enhancing reliability.\nEC has\
    \ recently been introduced to provide intermediate devices between the data\n\
    generator and CC services. This reduces latency and provides efﬁcient bandwidth\
    \ uti-\nlization. However, due to their limited computing power and battery life,\
    \ mobile devices\nstruggle to provide these services. To this end, mobile edge\
    \ computing (MEC) solutions\nhave been employed to ameliorate the intensive computation\
    \ and ofﬂoading bottlenecks\nbetween end-nodes and centralized data servers [9].\
    \ They allow mobile devices to ofﬂoad\ntheir computation duties onto servers at\
    \ the edge of the IoT network, such as cellular BSs\nor access points. In contrast\
    \ to traditional CC, MEC servers can be close to end-users. As a\nresult, MEC\
    \ servers can deliver low latency and secure services, while saving energy for\n\
    mobile users.\nRecently, UAVs have been integrated as air–ground equipment to\
    \ fulﬁll the processing\nand storage needs at IoT network edges. As a promising\
    \ solution, they could provide ultra-\nlow latency support for latency-sensitive\
    \ applications, facilitate the distribution of big data\nprocessing and analysis,\
    \ improve the scalability and management of massive mobile con-\nnectivity, as\
    \ well as content caching and mobile delivery [10]. The advantage presented by\n\
    their ﬂexible mobility has facilitated the integration of UAVs with MEC services\
    \ to provide\nUAV-enabled MEC networks. UAV-enabled MEC is typically deployed\
    \ in unpredictable\nenvironments such as in wild, desert, and complex landscapes.\
    \ Furthermore, the computa-\ntion performance may be adapted based on the distance\
    \ that UAVs can smoothly control.\nThis combination of UAV technology with MEC\
    \ makes the system more advantageous\nand ﬂexible than traditional MEC systems,\
    \ which are constrained by high deployment\ncosts due to their ﬁxed architecture.\
    \ In addition, the integration of UAV-enabled MEC\nwith the most recent security\
    \ approaches, such as the blockchain structure, increases the\nsecurity level\
    \ [11]. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that gives a secure, immutable,\n\
    transparent, and trustworthy environment for the UAVs to store their data as a\
    \ transaction\nin a chain of blocks [12]. This is a viable solution to mitigate\
    \ the security and privacy issues\nrelated to UAV networks. Therefore, integrating\
    \ blockchain into UAVs ensures the MEC\nsystem’s trustworthiness with the additional,\
    \ advantageous features of automating data\ntransaction, decision-making, storage,\
    \ and veriﬁcation [13]. Therefore, UAVs can play a\ncrucial role in enabling MEC\
    \ capability in IoT applications. However, many critical issues\nhave yet to be\
    \ addressed to improve the performance of UAV-enabled MEC. Most of the\nimpairments\
    \ are related to drones as they are autonomous and battery-powered, with\nlimited\
    \ resources. Furthermore, given the broadcast nature of communications between\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n3 of 30\nground-based users and UAVs, many performance aspects\
    \ should be addressed, including\nsecurity, task ofﬂoading, energy consumption,\
    \ resource allocation, computing capacity, and\nuser latency performance under\
    \ various channel circumstances.\nSince this topic is revolutionary in the IoT\
    \ research ﬁeld, reviewing the current sci-\nentiﬁc achievements and technological\
    \ limitations of UAV-enabled MEC networks is of\nparamount importance. Furthermore,\
    \ the limits of existing surveys on UAV-enabled MEC\nin IoT applications have\
    \ motivated us to put forward a detailed review. This paper explores\nthe use\
    \ of UAVs in emerging IoT applications and the utility of both deep learning (DL)\n\
    and machine learning (ML) in UAV-enabled MEC systems. For instance, the authors\
    \ of [14]\nhave elaborated a review about the energy efﬁciency constraints related\
    \ to UAV-enabled\nMEC systems for IoT devices. Additionally, the authors of [15,16]\
    \ have presented a survey\nabout communication and networking technologies for\
    \ UAVs. The research work presented\nin [17] has addressed both fundamental and\
    \ recent advances of computation ofﬂoading\nin UAV-enabled MEC. However, only\
    \ a few of the challenges are mentioned in the above\nworks, including energy,\
    \ communication facilities, and limited resource allocation issues.\nIn this paper,\
    \ the most critical issues and challenges of UAV-enabled MEC based on AI are\n\
    accurately outlined and discussed.\nIndeed, there are several recent reviews about\
    \ the UAV-enabled MEC paradigm. How-\never, most of the previous reviews have\
    \ focused on UAV energy efﬁciency, communication\ntechnologies connecting various\
    \ UAVs, and computation ofﬂoading in UAV-enabled MEC.\nOur review considers a\
    \ more practical and recent scenario wherein massively generated\ndata need to\
    \ be processed and analyzed using AI algorithms for decision-making at the\nedge\
    \ of networks. This has not been considered in the previous works. Adopting AI\n\
    methods would affect all the requirements that have already been investigated,\
    \ such as\nenergy efﬁciency, communication technologies, processing capacity,\
    \ privacy and security,\nand the autonomy of UAV-enabled MEC. Almost all domains\
    \ are currently relying on AI\nto outperform the traditional systems and provide\
    \ decision-making systems. For instance,\nIndustry 4.0 has newly emerged as a\
    \ revolutionary paradigm in which intelligent and\nautonomous drones based on\
    \ AI would be the key element. However, the integration of\nautonomous UAVs based\
    \ on AI is not obvious in most practical cases. This is why UAV-\nenabled MEC\
    \ based on AI would enable many applications in the industry community to\ndeploy\
    \ their solutions, by cooperatively executing and processing the massive volumes\n\
    of conﬁdential data near the users at the edge of the network. Consequently, the\
    \ current\nreview highlights the most recent challenges and open issues of UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC based\non AI, considering their various architectures and applications.\
    \ We will discuss the most\nrecent related works on data processing at the edge,\
    \ based on AI, and their advantages and\ninconveniences regarding the UAV environment.\
    \ We will even emphasize the effect of AI\non energy efﬁciency, communication\
    \ technologies, processing capacity, and security when\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture\
    \ is considered. In addition, we propose a list of applications\nwith open issues\
    \ that have to be taken into account when considering a UAV-enabled MEC\narchitecture.\n\
    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of\
    \ UAVs and\nhighlights some of their related applications. Section 3 focuses on\
    \ the possible opportunities\nenabled by UAVs, focusing on MEC servers. Section\
    \ 4 highlights the UAV-enabled MEC\nbased on AI. Section 5 lists signiﬁcant issues\
    \ and open research directions related to UAV-\nenabled MEC systems. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 presents a conclusion.\n2. UAV System Model\nRecently, there has been\
    \ an increase in customer demand for airborne intelligence\nmissions, which has\
    \ led to the design and development of various types of UAVs in various\nshapes\
    \ and ﬂight modes. This section highlights the different styles and characteristics\
    \ of\nUAVs and their application scenarios.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n4 of 30\n2.1.\
    \ UAVs Classiﬁcation\nDeploying a UAV network (known as swarms in IoT contexts)\
    \ is becoming a practical\nand necessary requirement for many applications. Various\
    \ UAVs are currently available\non the market, with distinctive features such\

    \ Generally, the selection of any UAV model should\nfulﬁll many of the criteria\
    \ of the targeted application, such as QoS, energy capacity, envi-\nronmental\
    \ restrictions, and federal rules [18]. There are three types of UAVs: low-altitude\n\
    platforms (LAPs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites. Since this work\
    \ focuses\non UAV-enabled MEC, UAVs are described based on many aspects.\nFigure\

    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n6 of 30\n2.2. UAV-Enabled Services\nUAV technology’s appealing\
    \ ﬂexibility and mobility characteristics have drawn atten-\ntion in terms of\
    \ integration with other networks as a way to address various challenging\napplications.\
    \ UAVs can be a part of IoT networks, referred to as the Internet of Flying\n\
    Things (IoFT) [25]. The IoFT can improve the availability of IoT services in areas\
    \ with poor\ncommunication coverage and limited infrastructures. For instance,\
    \ UAVs can provide FC\nand EC services and cellular communications in rural or\
    \ developing regions and submarine\nenvironments. As a result, reaching hostile\
    \ and congested environments has become easier\nand faster, thus improving emergent\
    \ intervention wherever and whenever it is required.\nAs support to communication\
    \ networks, UAVs can be dispatched as peripheral nodes with\nvarious operating\
    \ units, such as ﬂying BSs, relay nodes, or end-node stations [7]. UAVs act\n\
    as relay/terminal nodes related to disconnected nodes, stabilizing communication\
    \ links\nin an ad hoc manner. A set of deployed UAVs can thereby form a ﬂying\
    \ ad hoc network\n(FANET), which is a subclass of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET)\
    \ [26].\nIn IoT networks, UAVs can potentially adopt many recent cellular and\
    \ non-cellular\nwireless communication networks to control the UAV on the one\
    \ hand, and to enhance\nthe coverage and latency services on the other. The most\
    \ prominent communication pro-\ntocols that can be used with UAVs are IEEE 802.11\
    \ (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), IEEE\n802.15.4 (LRWPAN), cellular networks (3G/4G),\
    \ IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN\n(LoRa), SigFox and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ [27–31]. Typically, the choice of communica-\ntion protocol depends on the desired\
    \ achievable throughput, power consumption, range,\nimplementation cost, reliability,\
    \ delay, and security. Grouped according to application\nrequirements, the characteristics\
    \ of the most-used communication protocols are presented\nin [32]. As described\
    \ in Table 2, there are various available communication protocols that\ncan be\
    \ used in UAV-enabled MEC. Each protocol is given a list of advantages and disad-\n\
    vantages regarding data rate, coverage, deployment cost, energy consumption, latency,\n\
    spectrum availability, and the number of supported users. Thus, the use of communication\n\
    technology depends literally on the application requirements.\nAlong with high\
    \ mobility and scalability, UAVs can offer many potential opportu-\nnities in\
    \ terms of enabling services such as pervasive connectivity, aerial intelligence,\n\
    self-maintenance capabilities for communications, and sensor deployment. Therefore,\n\
    UAVs act as airborne BSs [33], data collectors, relay nodes [34], jammers [35],\
    \ monitors [36],\nedge- and cloud computing servers [37], and power suppliers\
    \ [38] to support IoT applica-\ntions. These will extend network coverage and\
    \ provide diversiﬁed and ﬂexible intelligence\nfacilities for new potentialities\
    \ in modern IoT applications. In summary, as illustrated\nin Figure 3, UAVs can\
    \ facilitate a wide range of solutions in IoT applications. They can\nprovide\
    \ intelligent communications by establishing wireless networks in inaccessible\
    \ and\nhazardous environments; they also enable parallel intelligent areal services,\
    \ such as CC,\nEC, and LC.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n7 of 30\nTable 2. Characteristics\

    Table 3 shows a list of UAV applications in various domains, their advantages\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural fields to detect specific\

    \ and AI classification based on \nIoT architecture, using real-time data acquisition\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural ﬁelds to detect speciﬁc diseases\n\
    that threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented system\
    \ can predict\nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing and AI\

    \ In ref. [40], the authors have proposed an\narchitecture combining UAVs and\

    in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting role in crop monitoring by facilitating\
    \ many\ntasks previously restricted to the laborer and farmer [45–47].\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0:\nThe increasing demand for fast and low-cost productivity has encouraged\
    \ the indus-\ntrial and research communities to incorporate robotics into the\
    \ industrial process. UAVs\nhave recently attracted the attention of industrial\
    \ solution providers in response to the\nincreased need for productivity; for\
    \ instance, the authors proposed an industrial IoT-based\nsystem that collects\
    \ data by a UAV camera and sends it to a cloud server for process-\ning [48].\
    \ The design aims to monitor the industrial zone to prevent undesirable incidents\n\
    in the production process, relying on the robust intelligence of computer vision\
    \ (CV) ap-\nproaches [49,50]. The mining industry has also increased the level\
    \ of interest in drones for\n3D mapping, mine safety, and mine management [51].\n\
    •\nEnvironment:\nUAVs are being adopted as a means to monitor and survey various\
    \ environmental\nareas. They can be used for the monitoring and data aggregation\
    \ of archeological sites. For\nexample, the authors of [52] have reported that\
    \ UAVs can present accurate and precise\nimages of the studied archeological space,\
    \ compared to terrestrial measurements. UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n10 of 30\ntechnologies\
    \ can also be deployed in ecological monitoring systems to track wildlife in\n\
    heterogeneous territories and topographically challenging areas as a supporting\
    \ platform\nfor traditional techniques [53]. Besides, this technology may facilitate\
    \ geological researchers\nwhen collecting remote data about many species and animals\
    \ [54]. Moreover, the authors\nof [55] proposed an intelligent model based on\
    \ UAV, dedicated to monitoring several types\nof plants using the latest computer\
    \ vision algorithms and cloud computing technologies.\nUAVs are also used to track\
    \ wild animals over large areas [56].\n•\nHealth and emergency:\nDrones can offer\
    \ several beneﬁts for public health emergencies, for instance, tackling\nepidemics\
    \ and contagious diseases such as COVID-19. For instance, during the COVID-19\n\
    pandemic, some governments and countries adopted drones to survey the rapid spread\n\
    of the virus, diagnose patients, and then predict the mortality risk factor by\
    \ applying AI\napproaches to the collected data. The drones have been used to\
    \ observe crowds, broadcast\ncritical public announcements and information, spray\
    \ disinfectants, and carry out extensive\ntemperature measurements in several\
    \ residential areas [57]. Additionally, the lifeguard\ncommunity uses UAVs for\
    \ search and rescue missions requiring rapid intervention. Their\nversatility\
    \ also allows obtaining a quick overview of the rescue situation instead of using\n\
    human-crewed airplanes that may take extra time to deploy [58]. Relying on UAV-enabled\n\
    MEC, AI, and CV schemes could lead to new applications that simulate visual reality,\n\
    thus enabling faster and real-time decisions in emergency interventions. For instance,\n\
    UAVs typically detect obstacles by ﬂying over them, gathering data, extracting\
    \ the most\nprominent features, and making decisions based on machine vision and\
    \ pattern recognition\ntechnologies. In this manner, people with visual impairments\
    \ can maneuver comfortably.\nThis technology is expected to be a key solution\
    \ in the healthcare revolution [58].\n•\nSmart cities and smart homes:\nThe urban\
    \ environment is expected to acquire a massive number of dynamically\nconnected\
    \ devices due to diverse activities wherein UAVs as mobile vehicles will have\
    \ many\npivotal roles, including real-time trafﬁc control [59], transportation\
    \ [60], infrastructure\ncontrol and management [61], and buildings observation\
    \ [62]. Accordingly, UAVs are\nexpected to provide communication services to heterogeneous\
    \ smart devices in urban\nareas, to improve the smart city from application perspectives\
    \ [63]. For example, the\nauthors of [64] have proposed an architecture for 5G\
    \ hierarchical IoT networks where the\nUAVs play a fundamental role as a data\
    \ fusion center, formation controller, and network\ngateway. In another context,\
    \ UAVs were used to perform lightweight parts delivery to\nworkstation operators\
    \ within a manufacturing plant, where GPS could not provide a\npractical solution\
    \ for indoor positioning, in addition to intelligent shipping, intelligent\nmonitoring,\
    \ and intelligent control [65].\n•\nNatural disaster tracking:\nDuring natural\
    \ disasters, a rapid and effective response is required to assist the popu-\n\
    lation, avoid increasing the number of victims, and minimize the economic impact.\
    \ UAVs\ncan respond quickly to earthquake help requests, ﬁnd missing people, and\
    \ facilitate the\nmonitoring and rescue of victims in danger of drowning during\
    \ ﬂoods [66,67]. Collecting\na large amount of data from different sensors deployed\
    \ in the environment, using UAV-\nenabled MEC with AI algorithms, can help to\
    \ rapidly predict and intervene in natural\ndisasters such as tornadoes, volcanic\
    \ eruptions, tsunamis, and storms.\n•\nConstruction:\nUAV-enabled MEC and computer\
    \ vision techniques are promising solutions for the\ncondition assessment of civilian\
    \ and public infrastructures. UAVs are being used increas-\ningly in many construction\
    \ tasks, such as building inspections [68], building condition\nmonitoring, damage\
    \ assessments of buildings after disasters [69], public site surveying\nand mapping\
    \ [70], safety inspections of construction sites and workers, and monitoring\n\
    the progress of construction [71].\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n11 of 30\nTable 3. Comparative\

    \ opportunity of UAV-mounted utilization via ﬂying relays and BSs\nthat can dynamically\
    \ reposition themselves to boost network coverage, increase spectral\nefﬁciency,\
    \ and improve user QoS. The UAVs enable low-altitude supports beyond line-of-\n\
    sight (LOS) control and reliable communications [72]. Furthermore, UAVs can bring\
    \ many\nfacilities to cellular IoT-based networks by providing processing facilities\
    \ near the ground\nfor users.\n2.4. UAV-Enabled and -Assisted MEC Architecture\n\
    Centralized networks are easy to maintain because they have just one point of\
    \ failure.\nHowever, due to the instability of the system categories, this design\
    \ is insufﬁcient to\nrespond to ubiquitous applications. A single issue affecting\
    \ the core server might destroy\nthe entire system. Unlike centralized networks,\
    \ distributed networks are deemed more\nstable due to their decentralized architecture,\
    \ since the entirety of the information system\nis dispersed among a vast number\
    \ of nodes that maintain similar conditions. This feature\nimproves distributed\
    \ system security by making it challenging to target many users.\nFurthermore,\
    \ blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed ledger that provides a\nsecure,\
    \ immutable, transparent, and trustless environment due to its distributed architec-\n\
    ture. Integrating this approach with UAVs allows them to record their data in\
    \ the chain of\nblocks as a transaction, ensuring their trustworthiness [74].\
    \ The essential foundations of\nblockchain technology are intelligent contracts\
    \ and consensus mechanisms. This method\neliminates the requirement for a trusted\
    \ third-party system to protect data privacy since\nconsensus techniques maintain\
    \ data integrity. The use of cryptographic methods guaran-\ntees that data on\
    \ blockchains are secure. These exciting blockchain characteristics increase\n\
    the applicability of UAVs in a variety of civil and mission-critical applications\
    \ that use\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture. Moreover, distributed systems outperform\
    \ centralized\nsystems in terms of network speed, since the information is not\
    \ stored in a central lo-\ncation, and the number of users attempting to access\
    \ a server is more signiﬁcant than\nthe server can support, causing long waiting\
    \ times and slowing down the system for\ndecentralized architecture.\nMoving all\
    \ computing activities to the cloud has proven an effective mechanism to\nprocess\
    \ data since the cloud offers greater processing capacity than network edge devices.\n\
    However, data-processing speeds have risen rapidly due to the size of communicated\
    \ data\nand the networks’ bandwidth. Therefore, CC suffers from bottlenecks due\
    \ to the massive\nvolume of data generated in real time. Cameras in UAVs capture\
    \ a tremendous amount\nof video data, which the system should process in real-time\
    \ to enable good decision-\nmaking. Sending data from UAVs to the cloud server\
    \ would mostly result in longer\ndelays. Deploying a large number of IoT devices,\
    \ such as UAVs, would restrict bandwidth,\nreliability and security. Therefore,\
    \ processing data at the network edge would yield shorter\nresponse times, more\
    \ efﬁcient processing, and less pressure on the network.\nMEC is widely acknowledged\
    \ as a vital technology to implement many methods for\nnext-generation IoT applications.\
    \ Due to their versatility and ease of deployment, UAVs\ncan play various roles\
    \ in delivering edge computing services. UAV-enabled MEC designs\ncan be classiﬁed\
    \ and dedicated to a speciﬁc application scenario. A UAV can be considered\nas\
    \ a mobile EC server, an IoT node, or a relay. Firstly, UAVs can participate in\
    \ the system as\nmobile devices when they ofﬂoad their computing to an MEC server.\
    \ Secondly, the UAV\ncan act as the MEC responsible for monitoring a group of\
    \ mobile end nodes. Thirdly, the\nUAV can serve as a relay or gateway between\
    \ mobile end nodes and an MEC server.\nThe UAV may be regarded as a speciﬁc user\
    \ that could ofﬂoad those computing tasks\nexceeding its memory and processing\
    \ capacity to a MEC server, as shown in Figure 4a.\nUAVs typically have limited\
    \ battery capacity and insufﬁcient memory and computing\npower to execute complex\
    \ computational tasks. As a result, ofﬂoading their processing to\nDrones 2021,\

    \ self-monitoring, and\nprediction. There is a considerable difference between\
    \ EC devices and centralized cloud\nservers regarding their processing capacities\
    \ and memory, limiting multiple AI technolo-\ngies for data processing at the\
    \ edge. Therefore, numerous criteria should be considered\nwhen incorporating\
    \ any AI technique to proﬁt from their robustness, due to memory ca-\npacity and\
    \ energy consumption constraints [111]. EC delivers resources in a decentralized\n\
    manner, allowing faster addressing of user demands than a regular CC, even with\
    \ limited\ncomputational capability. Various challenges arise, such as task scheduling,\
    \ resource allo-\ncation, and ofﬂoading, substantially inﬂuencing the overall\
    \ performance. Nevertheless,\nmost of the proposed solutions are characterized\
    \ by non-convexity and complexity, as\nthey enable continuous learning ability\
    \ for the dynamic environment and make a real-time\ninference with low computational\
    \ complexity. Applying AI to networking challenges has\ngained popularity over\
    \ the past few decades. For instance, ML has been widely used\nin the networking\
    \ domain due to its ability to interact with complex environments and\nmake decisions.\
    \ It may also provide eminent solutions to improve network performance in\nmany\
    \ subdomains, such as resource allocation, network trafﬁc prediction and classiﬁcation,\n\
    congestion control, and routing [32].\nIn most UAV-enabled MEC architectures,\
    \ a controller called the follow-me cloud\n(FMC) collects information about overall\
    \ system states (i.e., users, UAVs, and MEC servers).\nThis control unit is in\
    \ charge of managing ofﬂoading activities using AI technologies.\nFigure 5 displays\
    \ an example of a cloudlet mounted on a UAV for a UAV-assisted MEC\nsystem. The\
    \ UAV receives ofﬂoaded tasks from an IoT device and sends the results back\n\

    \ techniques include supervised \nlearning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement\

    \ not require labeled training data for resource allocation. Thus,\nit may enhance\
    \ the process of ofﬂoading choices based on various states of the channel en-\n\
    vironment. This results in reducing the energy bandwidth and computations. To\
    \ that end,\nan MDP method was provided to reduce the delay, energy consumption,\
    \ and bandwidth\nin UAV-assisted MEC by analyzing the instability of energy arrival,\
    \ stochastic computation\ntasks that are provided by wireless users, and a time-varying\
    \ channel state [112]. According\nto the authors of [113], UAV-assisted MEC-based\

    \ This is particularly true for joint optimization\nchallenges to improve system\
    \ efﬁciency. Furthermore, UAV communication will be incor-\nporated with 6G networks,\
    \ where IoT device mobility might lead to position uncertainty. In\nthis case,\
    \ DRL, as a hybrid of DL and RL, can offer decision-making solutions and optimize\n\
    handover issues in real-time. This approach allows UAVs to move dynamically and\
    \ in\nreal-time while assuring and minimizing communication delay [114].\nTable\

    \ have proved that the deep supervised learning (DSL) method min-\nimizes the\
    \ computation and ofﬂoading overheads and cost of mobile users in the MEC\nsystem.\
    \ This technique allows terrestrial users to obtain an optimal ofﬂoading policy,\
    \ with\nenergy-saving and processing speed enhancement.\nThe authors of [91] have\
    \ investigated the challenges associated with applying AI\ntechniques to UAV-NOMA-MEC\
    \ networks. They proposed an architecture that relies\non AI-based approaches,\
    \ particularly on federated learning and reinforcement learning.\nThe proposed\
    \ framework was dedicated to enabling terrestrial mobile users to ofﬂoad\ntheir\
    \ computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and ﬂexibly, thus enhancing\
    \ their\nconnectivity and reducing their transmission latency and energy consumption.\n\
    The authors of [135] used RL and transfer learning algorithms to reduce the latency\
    \ and\nenergy consumption in UAV-enabled MEC networks. They proved that transfer\
    \ learning,\nwhen combined with RL, could signiﬁcantly enhance the system training\
    \ performance\nwhen the users operated dynamically.\nAn optimization problem based\
    \ on MDP was formulated by the authors of [35] to\naddress UAV trajectory optimization\
    \ in UAV-mounted MEC networks. The approach\naimed to enhance the overall system\
    \ QoS, maximize the long-term system reward, and\nmeet the QoS constraint, including\
    \ the computation tasks of mobile users. In [136], the\nauthors have used the\
    \ semi-Markov process and DRL-based algorithms to address the\nUAV-enabled MEC\
    \ networks’ ofﬂoading decisions and resource management policies.\nThe authors\
    \ of [137] have developed a platform known as a ﬂying UAV MEC, in which\nUAVs\
    \ are outﬁtted with computing resources and provide task-ofﬂoading services to\
    \ users.\nThe suggested architecture’s primary purpose was to maximize UAV aerial\
    \ trajectory,\nuser association, and resource allocation. The trajectory control\
    \ method has been used\nto address the optimization issue, assisted by an RL-based\
    \ technique. The results of this\napproach outperformed the results of the equivalent\
    \ benchmark methods. Moreover, the\nauthors of [138] formulated an ML-based novel\
    \ framework to optimize UAV trajectories\nby estimating the user’s mobility data\
    \ to ﬁnd optimal initial UAV placement locations.\nThe joint problem, consisting\
    \ of UAVs trajectories and power control to improve the sum\nrate and maintain\
    \ the data rate requirements of mobile users, was also addressed in the\nemployment\
    \ of a multi-agent Q-learning-based technique. A smart ofﬂoading based on the\n\
    deep Q-learning approach was proposed by the authors of [139] to optimize performance\n\
    in terms of the delay perceived by ground devices connected to the FANET, to enable\
    \ MEC\nin the 5G ﬁeld.\n5. Discussion and Open Issues\nComputational intelligence,\
    \ when combined with UAVs, has improved the underlying\ntechnologies and implementations\
    \ of IoT applications. Nevertheless, researchers should\naddress the remaining\
    \ challenges. Therefore, some signiﬁcant issues need more attention\nin order\
    \ to beneﬁt from UAVs for the realization of ﬂying ECs. These issues may be\n\
    related to scientiﬁc, technological, and societal problems, including challenges\
    \ regarding\nthe technical aspects of the technology, security and privacy concerns,\
    \ and standardization.\nThe challenges concern both the UAVs themselves and EC\
    \ devices. Therefore, great effort\nis needed to address the following challenges.\n\
    Energy consumption: In any UAV-enabled IoT system, most sensors, edge devices,\
    \ and\ndrones are battery-powered and can only remain powered for a limited period.\
    \ Therefore,\nefﬁcient energy consumption protocols and mechanisms are essential\
    \ for UAVs and IoT de-\nvices to ensure a long network lifetime. Improvement efforts\
    \ should address the hardware\nand software architecture of the IoT components\
    \ by integrating energy-harvesting solutions\nor efﬁcient routing protocols. For\
    \ example, AI schemes can be adopted to predict a UAV’s\nresidual energy and energy\
    \ dissipation through the precise adjustment of transmission\nand control parameters\
    \ concerning channel changes. The processing energy dissipation,\ncommunication\
    \ energy, storage energy, and environmental reliability should be considered\n\
    to mitigate the energy of UAVs [115,140]. Moreover, the issues listed below should\
    \ also\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n22 of 30\nbe considered to mitigate energy consumption,\
    \ to extend the on-air ﬂying time of the\nUAVs employed.\nInterference: The communication\
    \ links between UAVs and IoT devices may become\ndisconnected due to interference,\
    \ which reduces latency performance and may also affect\nthe overall network,\
    \ especially when the UAVs act as a mobile BS. Therefore, the problem\nof interference\
    \ should be addressed, especially in urban and industrial environments,\nwhere\
    \ the number of interconnected devices on the same frequency band is very dense.\
    \ An\nAI-based solution can be applied in UAV-enabled MEC to predict the signal-to-interference\n\
    ratio, based on the collected channel state information (CSI). It is then possible\
    \ to decide on\nthe most appropriate scheme to combat the impact of interference\
    \ or to adjust transmission\nparameters in order to reduce power consumption.\n\
    Interoperability: In any IoT environment, many devices are expected to handle\
    \ the\nrequired tasks without any effort from the end-users. These devices try\
    \ to connect and\ninteract with each other using different protocols and communication\
    \ paradigms. With\nthis diversity, it is sometimes challenging to orchestrate\
    \ the system smoothly. Therefore,\nfurther investigations are necessary to unify\
    \ the controller and communication protocols to\nensure interoperability among\
    \ them.\nMobility and path planning: UAVs require auto-maneuvering without distant\
    \ hu-\nman pilot intervention in random dynamic IoT applications. Therefore, many\
    \ intelligent\nmethods should be considered to enable autonomous UAV ﬂights that\
    \ include collision\navoidance. AI algorithms are the most viable solutions that\
    \ can be used to detect obsta-\ncles and avoid collisions [141]. For instance,\
    \ DL techniques can enable learning from the\ngathered data, which makes their\
    \ integration into UAV a signiﬁcant solution. A serious\neffort should be considered\
    \ to develop green-federated AI solutions, such as RL, to ensure\naccurate auto-ﬂying\
    \ decisions and path and trajectory planning [35,132].\nScalability: The scalability\
    \ challenges concern resources, applications, load balancing,\nand connections.\
    \ Enabling high scalability requires designing efﬁcient schemes that could\neffectively\
    \ manage heterogeneous mobile devices and servers in a UAV-enabled MEC\nenvironment,\
    \ with its highly dynamic demand behavior. For example, some mobile appli-\ncations,\
    \ such as UAVs and autonomous driving, require high data throughput ofﬂoading\
    \ to\nsuccessfully provide such services, despite heterogeneity in the number\
    \ of mobile devices\nand the dynamic demand behavior of the applications mentioned\
    \ in the MEC environment.\nThe MEC system should have an acceptable degree of\
    \ scalability regarding the number\nof servers and services required. As a result,\
    \ it is challenging for difﬁcult areas to estab-\nlish connections and communications\
    \ between mobile devices and servers. To achieve\nconvenient and cost-effective\
    \ mobility and scalability, resulting in continuous service, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to have a stable connection, even in adverse environmental conditions.\nSecurity:\
    \ Drones enable ubiquitous services on an IoT scale. The communications\nand controls\
    \ are realized through P2P wireless transmissions and thus are open to many\n\
    security threats. Therefore, unauthorized connections threaten the system’s privacy.\
    \ It is\nnecessary to propose and design security mechanisms to improve UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC sys-\ntems’ security [142]. The effort should focus on the physical, application,\
    \ and MAC layers.\nThe solutions should integrate recent robust techniques such\
    \ as blockchains, especially\nin IoT applications where UAVs are expected to facilitate\
    \ communication networks. The\ncombination of UAVs with blockchain and AI is now\
    \ an exciting avenue of research to\npredict all sorts of attacks and malware\
    \ that threaten the system’s privacy [127]. However,\nwhile there has been signiﬁcant\
    \ progress in this area, more work needs to be done. Power\nconsumption might\
    \ be a critical constraint for blockchain-based applications as they need\nmore\
    \ computing power. Increasingly complex attacks, such as quantum attacks, ML,\
    \ and\ntheory-based game attacks, could challenge the privacy of blockchain systems\
    \ [143]. More\nresearch is needed to make private blockchain networks more immutable\
    \ and secure in\nUAV-enabled MEC architectures. Moreover, blockchain-enabled softwarization\
    \ for secure\nUAV network systems is also a critical challenge. Blockchain implementation\
    \ in UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n23 of 30\nsystems presents a complex system integration\
    \ problem requiring rigorous testing before\nconcrete implementation [12].\nIntegration\
    \ of AI schemes: Recently, the utilization of AI schemes among DL, ML, and\nRL\
    \ has become increasingly of interest, to beneﬁt from their powerful performance.\
    \ AI\nschemes are being integrated into UAV-enabled MEC systems as a way to make\
    \ contextual\ndecisions and learn from aggregated data gathered from previous\
    \ tracking experiences. The\ndata collected by the sensors in real-time can be\
    \ proﬁtably exploited for the autonomous\npiloting of UAVs. Therefore, processing\
    \ tasks demand strict computing and storage\nrequirements at computing facilities,\
    \ to be executed exceptionally at the edge. UAVs\nalso have energy and storage\
    \ limitations; thus, portable and lightweight RL, ML, and DL\nalgorithms should\
    \ be designed to cope with these constraints.\nRegulations: Despite the rapid\
    \ emergence of this technology, UAV regulations are\nstill in their infancy, and\
    \ a lack of heterogeneity of national rules and varying levels of\nimplementation\
    \ can be observed. These regulations differ from state to state, and the type\n\
    of regulation is based on the requirements of that use. Several problems are associated\
    \ with\nUAV regulation, including delays in ﬂight approval and poorly documented\
    \ administrative\nprocesses limiting the desired ﬂexibility, preventing widespread\
    \ use of the technology [144].\nLatency and computation issues: Communication\
    \ latency and computing optimization\nremain concerns in MEC-enabled UAV applications,\
    \ affecting transmission efﬁciency and\nreaction time under communication and\
    \ computing constraints. UAV transmission success\nmay be accomplished by offering\
    \ effective methods that decrease response delay. In\none study [145], for example,\
    \ stochastic geometry and queueing theory approaches were\nstudied to minimize\
    \ the response delay for a MEC-enabled UAV network.\nResource allocation: Due\
    \ to UAV battery concerns and trajectory constraints, resource\nallocation is\
    \ critical in UAV-enabled MEC networks. Resources allocation is involved in\n\
    three processes: computing task ofﬂoading, local computing, and UAV hovering.\
    \ Design-\ning an appropriate trajectory can ultimately compromise the calculated\
    \ performance and\noperating costs. According to the authors of [146], resource\
    \ allocation may be structured to\nmeet various goals, including computing bit\
    \ maximization, energy minimization, compu-\ntational efﬁciency maximization,\
    \ cost minimization, completion time minimization, and\nthe consideration of fairness.\n\
    UAV-enabled IoT for B5G and 6G issues: Data-gathering faces several problems in\
    \ IoT\nthat extend beyond the ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation\
    \ (6G) wireless\nmobile networks. A large amount of data will be generated by\
    \ heterogeneous devices,\nparticularly IoT devices and smartphones at the mobile\
    \ edge; these data are fragmented and\ndispersed among several machines. Therefore,\
    \ distributed solutions such as UAV-enabled\nMEC should be leveraged near mobile\
    \ users to ofﬂoad and process the data. Meanwhile,\ngrowing privacy concerns make\
    \ data collecting increasingly challenging. This consumes\nmore energy and decreases\
    \ the system’s ofﬂoading time [147].\n6. Conclusions\nThe development of wireless\
    \ communication technologies and IT services has made\nthe role of drones more\
    \ ubiquitous in various ﬁelds of application. Drones can serve\nas a link between\
    \ smart devices and cloud data centers, to provide many services that\ncan increase\
    \ the performance of a given IoT system. To the best of our knowledge, this\n\
    paper is considered the ﬁrst work that provides a review of drone-enabled MECs\
    \ based on\nAI. This work discusses the current research trends and provides future\
    \ insights into the\npotential uses of UAV-enabled MEC in the ﬁeld of IoT. It\
    \ highlights the potential roles that\nUAVs can play in enabling communications\
    \ and intelligent computing in the IoT era, by\nreferring to the most widely emerging\
    \ AI techniques that are employed. As mentioned,\nUAVs as MECs are attracting\
    \ considerable interest in scientiﬁc research, to address the\nvarious problems\
    \ and challenges experienced in order to improve the performance of such\napplications\
    \ in different scenarios, such as resource allocation, energy efﬁciency, latency,\n\
    task ofﬂoading, and security. UAV-enabled MEC present an emerging concept that\
    \ require\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n24 of 30\nmore effort to achieve the necessary\
    \ performance in every scenario of UAV application in\nIoT environments, especially\

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\
    \ and a high-level system architecture are presented in Section 5.\nDiscussion\
    \ and possible opportunities and challenges are discussed in Sections 6 and 7,\n\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\
    \ proceedings were searched\nand acquired from three citation databases: ACM,\

    \ Next, results were ﬁltered using the exclusion criteria mentioned in Table 1.\
    \ A ﬁrst\nlevel discrimination was based on the paper’s type, followed by title\

    \ relevant to our study, of which about 50% were in con-\nference proceedings.\
    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, power sources and energy harvesting schemes, micro-controllers and transceivers\n\
    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ connections with the Internet and the overall efﬁciency of the IoT applica-\n\
    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

    \ and applications has increased data\nprocessing and storage requirements. The\
    \ Edge computing concept aims to leverage the processing\ncapabilities of the\
    \ IoT and other devices placed at the edge of the network. One embodiment of\n\
    this paradigm is Fog computing, which provides an intermediate and often hierarchical\
    \ processing\ntier between the data sources and the remote Cloud. Among the major\
    \ beneﬁts of this concept, the\nend-to-end latency can be decreased, thus favoring\
    \ time-sensitive applications. Moreover, the data\ntrafﬁc at the network core\
    \ and the Cloud computing workload can be reduced. Combining the Fog\ncomputing\
    \ paradigm with Complex Event Processing (CEP) and data fusion techniques has\
    \ excellent\npotential for generating valuable knowledge and aiding decision-making\
    \ processes in the Internet of\nThings’ systems. In this context, we propose a\
    \ multi-tier complex event processing approach (sensor\nnode, Fog, and Cloud)\
    \ that promotes fast decision making and is based on information with 98%\naccuracy.\
    \ The experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending messages\
    \ in the\nnetwork. In addition, we achieved a reduction of 82% in data trafﬁc.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; Fog computing; complex event processing\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to [1], the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is composed of physical\n\
    and virtual entities where physical entities turn into virtual things inside a\
    \ cyber-world.\nThese things are embedded with different abilities such as sensing,\
    \ analyzing, processing,\nand self-management capacities. By adopting interoperable\
    \ communication protocols,\nthese smart things should have unique identities and\
    \ virtual personalities. The recent\ngrowth of Internet services and applications\
    \ has contributed to increasing data processing\nand storage requirements. Such\
    \ requirements are diverse in terms of the required resources\nby different applications,\
    \ thus calling for customized solutions.\nEdge computing recently emerged to overcome\
    \ some drawbacks of using Cloud\ncomputing as a back-end platform for IoT. Such\
    \ drawbacks include its unpredictable\nlatency, lack of location awareness and\
    \ user mobility [2]. The Edge computing concept\naims to leverage the processing\
    \ capabilities of IoT devices by using gateways, base stations,\nand other Edge\
    \ devices, providing an intermediate tier between the end-devices (data\nproducers/consumers)\
    \ and the remote Cloud. The presence of Edge devices enables the\nlocal processing\
    \ of requests, reducing the Cloud computing workload and application\nresponse\
    \ time.\nThe Edge computing paradigm has been applied to several emerging scenarios\
    \ and\nadopted by IoT applications that are time-critical and have sensitive data\
    \ (in terms of\nprivacy). One embodiment of this paradigm is Fog computing. Fog\
    \ computing denotes a\ndecentralized computing infrastructure consisting of processing\
    \ nodes placed anywhere on\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21217226\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n2 of 22\nthe continuum\
    \ between the end-devices and the Cloud. According to [3], Fog is a “cloud\nclosest\
    \ to the ground”. It extends the traditional Cloud computing architecture to the\
    \ edge\nof the network, enabling the processing and analyzing of some data at\
    \ that tier. The Fog\narchitecture is generally composed of at least three tiers.\
    \ The low tier consists of IoT devices\nthat collect, pre-process and forward\
    \ data to the Fog nodes. The middle tier comprises Fog\nnodes (with a higher processing\
    \ power than the IoT devices) that perform data processing,\ndecision making,\
    \ and actuation. The Cloud stores information and processes data that Fog\nnodes\
    \ did not have enough computing resources to process in the upper tier.\nFog computing\
    \ bridges the gap between the Cloud and end-devices (e.g., IoT nodes)\nby enabling\
    \ computing, storage, networking, and data management on network nodes\nwithin\
    \ the close vicinity of IoT devices. Consequently, computation, storage, networking,\n\
    decision making, and data management occur not only in the Cloud but also along\
    \ the\nIoT-to-Cloud path as data traverses to the Cloud (preferably close to the\
    \ IoT devices) [4].\nOne of the main differences between Cloud and Fog computing\
    \ concerns the scale of\nhardware components associated with these computing paradigms.\
    \ Cloud computing\nprovides highly available computing resources at relatively\
    \ high power consumption,\nwhereas Fog computing provides moderate availability\
    \ of computing resources at lower\npower consumption [5].\nTo perform raw data\
    \ processing in the Fog and Cloud tier some techniques can be\napplied aiming\
    \ to extract meaningful information, thus generating knowledge. In addition,\n\
    other techniques are often used to perform pre-processing functions, with different\
    \ goals,\nsuch as spurious data ﬁltering and dimensional reduction. Data pre-processing\
    \ techniques\ncan help improve the quality of the data produced while reducing\
    \ the use of resources\nin processing tasks. A widely adopted technique in both\
    \ the steps of sensor data pre-\nprocessing and processing is data fusion. Data\
    \ fusion [6] can be understood as a process of\naggregating and combining data\
    \ from multiple sources to prevent redundancy and reduce\nthe response time. It\
    \ can also improve data accuracy by using data from various sources to\ncompose\
    \ complete information. In addition to data fusion, complex event processing (CEP)\n\
    techniques also contribute to improving the information generated by sensors.\
    \ CEP goes\nbeyond simple data query and transformation and aims to detect patterns\
    \ in the data using\nﬁltering techniques, correlation, and creating new, composite\
    \ events from simple ones.\nIn this context, this work proposes a multi-tier approach\
    \ for complex event processing\nin Fog-based IoT systems. Our approach aims to\
    \ process events based on sensing data\nwith low response time and high accuracy.\
    \ One of the goals of our proposal is to reduce\nthe number of messages exchanged\
    \ between the sensed area and the Cloud. The main idea\nis to identify a simple\
    \ event that triggers the complex event processing, aiming to identify\nthe nodes\
    \ related to the event and extract the characteristics of the sensed location.\
    \ In this\nway, information is processed in different tiers, according to the\
    \ capacity of each device,\noptimizing the use of computational resources and\
    \ decreasing the average response time,\nboth between the sensor and the Fog tier\
    \ and between the Fog tier and the Cloud. The data\nare collected, managed, and\
    \ processed according to the application requirements and in\na decentralized\
    \ way. Different tiers are responsible for the collection, analysis, decision\n\
    making, and support of IoT systems. Aiming to harness the intrinsic capabilities\
    \ of the Fog\ncomputing environment, this approach also explores the typical concept\
    \ of the geolocation\nFog enhanced with an information context to consolidate\
    \ the data in the Fog nodes. Sensor\nnodes are selected and orchestrated using\
    \ their distance to the Fog node and the type of\nsensed data. So, our geographical\
    \ distributed and context-aware approach can help to\nimprove low latency and\
    \ consistent data access.\nThe main contribution of this work is the proposal\
    \ of a hierarchical approach of\na complex event processing (CEP) mechanism aiming\
    \ to (i) reduce data exchange and\nresponse time and (ii) increase information\
    \ accuracy to make timely decisions and support\na complete data processing workﬂow\
    \ for smart agriculture applications.\nThus, among the advantages of our CEP approach\
    \ in three tiers, we can cite:\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n3 of 22\n•\nThe CEP mechanisms\
    \ distributed in the network are capable of load balancing with\nless processing\
    \ power, generating complex events, and processing them in tiers with\ngreater\
    \ processing power;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism can be implemented in the event of\
    \ an increase in data volume,\nchanging only the tier of the hierarchy in question;\n\
    •\nNetwork trafﬁc to transfer information between tiers can be signiﬁcantly reduced,\n\
    sending only the data necessary for processing events at the appropriate tiers.\n\
    We simulated scenarios in precision agriculture to evaluate the proposed approach.\
    \ It\nwas tailored to the requirements of IoT applications from the smart agriculture\
    \ domain.\nThe experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending\
    \ messages in\nthe network and 82% of improvement in the throughput using the\
    \ proposed approach\ncompared to systems without our proposal. Additionally, tests\
    \ were conducted to validate\nthe proposed complex event processing engine.\n\
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the related\
    \ work.\nThe proposed approach is presented in Section 3, and Section 4 covers\
    \ the materials and\nmethods. The results are discussed in Section 5. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Related Work\nManaging data acquired by a\
    \ vast array of heterogeneous sensors remains as complex\nas the knowledge needed\
    \ to make a decision on the practices of an agricultural process.\nThis is mainly\
    \ due to the fact that processing is required in the various temporal and spatial\n\
    dimensions of the acquired data. This task implies that data should become available\
    \ in\na suitable time window and format to be viewed and stored, but also to feed\
    \ decision-\nmaking support systems. Managing data and extracting timely information\
    \ is also quickly\nbecoming a key issue. In this context, the authors in [7] proposed\
    \ a universal CEP mech-\nanism for IoT monitoring using Edge computing. In addition,\
    \ a formalized hierarchical\ncomplex event model is created, including raw, simple,\
    \ and complex events, to reduce the\ncomplexity of event modeling. The model uses\
    \ complex time and space semantics to deﬁne\nﬂexible events through algorithms.\
    \ The authors in [8] use a hybrid approach, in which\ntwo data processing tiers,\
    \ the Edge-tier and Cloud-tier, work together to provide effective\nIoT data analysis.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, raw data are locally collected at IoT devices. Features are\nextracted\
    \ by performing data fusion techniques in devices with greater processing power\n\
    and then sending the result to the Cloud.\nThe work described in [9] addresses\
    \ the hierarchical data fusion in IoT networks that\ncontain Edge devices, network\
    \ and communication units, and Cloud platforms. Different\ndata sources are combined\
    \ at each tier to produce timely and accurate results. The work\npresented in\
    \ [10] proposes utilizing complex event processing and a hierarchical distributed\n\
    architecture for enabling data fusion at various levels. To this purpose, their\
    \ paper intro-\nduces complex event processing (CEP) as a potential way of implementing\
    \ sensor data\nfusion in distributed IoT systems. Aiming to leverage local processing\
    \ capabilities wher-\never possible, or off-load tasks to Edge/Cloud computing\
    \ otherwise—thereby paving the\nway for a multi-layered, hierarchical data fusion\
    \ approach, aiming to reduce the network’s\nresponse time and amounts of transferred\
    \ data. Another work dealing with a large amount\nof data is [11], where a new\
    \ computing paradigm was proposed, designed to process\nBig Data in a collaborative\
    \ Edge (CEE) environment. The work proposed the fusion of\ngeographically distributed\
    \ data, creating shared virtual visualizations of the data exposed\nto the end-users\
    \ through interfaces predeﬁned by the data owners.\nIn [12], the authors proposed\
    \ and analyzed a CEP-based Fog architecture for real-time\nIoT applications that\
    \ uses a publish–subscribe protocol. A testbed was developed with\nlow-cost and\
    \ local resources to verify the suitability of CEP-engines to low-cost comput-\n\
    ing resources. To assess the performance, they analyzed the effectiveness and\
    \ cost of\nthe proposal in terms of latency and resource usage, respectively.\
    \ In [13], a weighted\ncost model is proposed to minimize IoT applications’ execution\
    \ time and energy con-\nsumption in a computing environment with multiple IoT\
    \ devices, multiple Fog/Edge\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n4 of 22\nservers, and Cloud\
    \ servers. In addition, a new application placement technique based\non the Memetic\
    \ Algorithm is proposed to make batch application placement decisions\nfor concurrent\
    \ IoT applications. Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications, they also\n\
    proposed a lightweight pre-scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of parallel\
    \ tasks\nfor concurrent execution.\nIn [14], the authors proposed a scalable network\
    \ architecture for monitoring and\ncontrolling agriculture in rural areas. Compared\
    \ to the existing IoT-based farming solutions,\nthe proposed solution reduces\
    \ network latency up to a certain extent. In that paper,\na cross-layer-based\
    \ channel access and routing solution for sensing and actuating were\nproposed.\
    \ The work of [15] used innovative platform technology to be applied to the Cloud\n\
    agriculture platform. Cloud integration can be applied to large-area data collection\
    \ and\nanalysis, allowing farmland with limited network information resources\
    \ to be integrated\nand automated. Those improvements, including agricultural\
    \ monitoring automation, pest\nmanagement image analysis, and monitoring can also\
    \ be used to solve the predicament of\nlarge-area automation construction.\nMore\
    \ speciﬁcally on precision agriculture, the authors of [16] proposed a framework\n\
    designed to provide a complete farming ecosystem. The framework facilitates the\
    \ sim-\nulation of custom farming scenarios for users, speciﬁcally to identify\
    \ sensor placement,\ncoverage area, line-of-sight deployment, data gathering through\
    \ a relay mechanism or\nairborne systems, mobility models for mobile nodes, energy\
    \ models for on-ground sensors\nand airborne vehicles, and back-end computing\
    \ support using Fog computing paradigm.\nIn [17], the authors proposed a multi-criterion-based\
    \ resource allocation policy with re-\nsource reservation to minimize overall\
    \ delay, processing time, and service level agreement\n(SLA) violations. This\
    \ process considers Fog computing-related characteristics, such as\ndevice heterogeneity,\
    \ resource constraints, and mobility, as well as dynamic changes in\nuser requirements.\
    \ The authors employed multiple objective functions to ﬁnd appropriate\nresources\
    \ for executing time-sensitive tasks in the Fog environment.\nThe work of [18]\
    \ was a review to identify all relevant research on new computing\nparadigms with\
    \ smart agriculture. They also proposed a new architecture model with the\ncombinations\
    \ of Cloud–Fog–Edge. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the agricultural\napplication\
    \ domains, research approaches, and the applications. Moreover, the survey\ndiscussed\
    \ the components used in the architecture models and brieﬂy explores the commu-\n\
    nication protocols used to interact from one layer to another.\nAll the studies\
    \ mentioned above have contributed to improving Fog computing and\nCEP performance\
    \ in different ways. However, their event model has been abstractly\ndeﬁned, some\
    \ without hierarchical or speciﬁc description mechanisms. Therefore, focusing\n\
    on the event model, data fusion, and information quality remain the unsolved technical\n\
    issues our CEP approach currently addresses. Furthermore, some experiments were\n\
    performed to evaluate our approach performance regarding data trafﬁc, decision\
    \ quality,\nand response time.\nIn our work, the fusion classiﬁcation, as described\
    \ in [19], based on the data type\n(redundant, cooperative, and complementary)\
    \ is used in conjunction with the classiﬁcation\nbased on abstraction tiers (low,\
    \ medium, and high). In addition, the proposal includes the\nintegration of the\
    \ CEP technique in the hierarchy of tiers. The CEP technique detects a\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ number of events with low latency [20]. Our approach is described in Section\
    \ 3.\nAdvantages of the proposed CEP approach on three tiers can be outlined as\
    \ follows:\n•\nThe CEP mechanisms distributed in the network can improve the information\
    \ quality\nby adding information to the observed data;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism\
    \ can be implemented in the event of an increase in the volume\nof data, changing\
    \ only the hierarchy tier in question;\n•\nThe response time of transferring information\
    \ between tiers can be significantly reduced.\nTable 1 lists the main contributions\

    \ Processing Approach\nModern IoT systems tend to go beyond the notion of “bottom–up”\
    \ monitoring. Thus,\nsensing devices are not only in charge of collecting raw\
    \ data and transferring it over\nthe network. They also implemented a “descendant”\
    \ feedback communication between\nthe network tiers (e.g., for decision making\
    \ based on data). The proposed approach\nuses coordination functionality as part\
    \ of this two-way communication responsible for\ncommunication between the tiers\
    \ described. More speciﬁcally, coordination is a two-way\nfunctionality. On the\
    \ one hand, the Fog device receives data from lower-tier devices,\ncollecting\
    \ and dispatching to processors and data fusion engines at the upper tier if\n\
    necessary. On the other hand, the Fog device sends the new processing rules to\
    \ the lower\ntiers according to the changes observed in the data behavior. Thus,\
    \ the proposed conceptual\napproach comprises the implementation and execution\
    \ tiers of complex event processing\nin devices. Figure 1 describes the separation\
    \ conceptual of tasks at all three tiers. These\ntasks have dedicated instances\
    \ of data fusion (DF) mechanisms: low tier (LDF), medium\ntier (MDF), and high\
    \ tier (HDF) data fusion [9]. The two top tiers include coordination\ncomponents\
    \ (LDF and MDF coordinators), responsible for bidirectional communication\nbetween\
    \ the lower and upper-tier nodes and managing requests from the lower-tier nodes.\n\
    The architecture of our proposal (Figure 1) is composed of three different tiers\
    \ which\nprocess simple and complex events from several different sources. The\
    \ low-tier devices\n(IoT devices) collect data from the real world (for example,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature).\nA relatively limited fusion technique (a simple\
    \ aggregation such as simple or weighted\narithmetic averages) was performed at\
    \ this tier. Then, the result was sent to the medium\ntier (Fog node). This aspect\
    \ reduces the data ﬂow in the sensor tier, the network segment\nwith less transmission\
    \ capacity. The Fog node is located close to the IoT devices or along the\ncommunication\
    \ path to the Cloud nodes. Fog node performs a complementary fusion of all\ndata\
    \ received by the sensor nodes using event processing techniques, thus allowing\
    \ local\ndecision making regarding the sensed area with low latency. It is essential\
    \ to highlight that\na Fog node has fewer resources than a Cloud node and just\
    \ local knowledge, unlike Cloud\nnodes. Therefore, a Fog node can apply less sophisticated\
    \ data fusion algorithms than\nthose of a Cloud node. However, a Fog node can\
    \ use more complex algorithms than an IoT\ndevice because it has a broader computational\
    \ capacity to process and fuse information\nand receives a higher amount of data\
    \ from different sources. Furthermore, if necessary,\nthe Fog node can also directly\
    \ act on the sensed area, aiming to reduce latency. Finally,\nthe Fog node sends\
    \ the data transformed by the data fusion and CEP methods to the high\ntier (Cloud\
    \ node), which, according to the application, may be responsible for persistently\n\
    storing the data and creating global inferences.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n6 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture for multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach.\n\
    Our approach is also composed of geolocation and context-aware sensor nodes. In\
    \ this\nway, when a new sensor node connects to the network, it is associated\
    \ with a speciﬁc Fog\nbased on its location and context information. For this\
    \ purpose, the nodes start sending a\nbroadcast message to the Fog nodes which\
    \ includes its coordinates (latitude and longitude)\nand the type of data collected.\
    \ If the Fog node is compatible with a datum type, it calculates\nthe Euclidean\
    \ distance between them and sends the data to the Cloud node. For better\ncomprehension,\
    \ we exemplify a sensor that sends temperature data to only connect to\na Fog\
    \ node that processes temperature data. The Cloud node checks the Fog with the\n\
    lowest distance calculated and returns this information to the corresponding Fog\
    \ node.\nIn turn, the Fog node forwards the information to the sensor node. Then,\
    \ the sensor node\nonly sends the collected data to the corresponding Fog, so\
    \ it is processed according to the\napproach requests.\nOur proposal uses the\
    \ CEP model of rules presented in [20] and according to the\nfollowing mechanisms:\n\
    1.\nA simple event is extracted from the result of the simple fusion of the collected\
    \ raw\ndata; the aggregation was performed on a number N of sensor readings;\n\
    2.\nIn the Fog tier, a rule mechanism describes the events generated from the\
    \ received\nvalue. The aggregation performed at the IoT device tier can trigger\
    \ other different\nevents based on the obtained result. An example in the agriculture\
    \ domain would\nbe a temperature change. If the value has not changed since the\
    \ last data were sent,\nthen an event that results in a message being sent should\
    \ be triggered; if changed,\nthe calculation of a daily irrigation event should\
    \ be triggered;\n3.\nThe set of simple events is aggregated, generating more complex\
    \ events, and the Fog\nprocesses the event according to the deﬁned rules;\n4.\n\
    Depending on the event complexity, whenever an event requires a global view, a\
    \ new\nevent sends the data to be processed in the Cloud.\nAccording to [21],\
    \ these four mechanisms can be denominated: data receiver, rule\nmechanism, event\
    \ executor, and event forwarder. We highlight that the processing of\nseveral\
    \ simple events is complex event processing. Figure 2 exempliﬁes the multi-tier\n\
    CEP mechanism.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n7 of 22\nFigure 2. Example of the multi-tier\
    \ CEP mechanism.\nSensor nodes are associated with a speciﬁc Fog node according\
    \ to their characteristics,\nsuch as location and context. For this connection,\
    \ when a sensor node is added to the\nnetwork, it sends a broadcast message to\
    \ the Fog nodes, including coordinates’ parameters\n(latitude and longitude values)\
    \ and the type of data collected. If the Fog node is compatible\n(same type),\
    \ it calculates the Euclidean distance between them and sends its calculated\n\
    value to the Cloud node. This is necessary because the Cloud is the only tier\
    \ with a\nglobal knowledge of the network since the Fog nodes do not communicate\
    \ with each other.\nThe data compatibility is related to the data type that the\
    \ Fog can process. For example,\nan IoT device sending temperature data will only\
    \ connect to a Fog node that processes\ntemperature data. The Cloud node veriﬁes\
    \ the nearest Fog based on the lowest calculated\ndistance value and returns this\
    \ information to the corresponding Fog node. The Fog node,\nin turn, forwards\
    \ this information to the IoT device.\nUsing the CEP mechanism, we can separate\
    \ the process of knowledge generation into\npartial processing and decision making.\
    \ Thus, not only processing but network latency was\nalso reduced. For example,\
    \ when detecting an “abnormal” temperature, the sensor only\nsends the data to\
    \ the decision-making part, which handles tasks of semantic reasoning,\nsuch as\
    \ correlating the data received. In general, the CEP technique can be seen as\
    \ a\nmethod that receives and correlates a set of simple events generating complex\
    \ events.\nThus, it is responsible for detecting simple events, using a cycle\
    \ of ﬁltering, correlation,\ncontextualization, and data analysis from different\
    \ sources.\n3.1. Description of Application Rules and Events: Precision Agriculture\n\
    In the agricultural sector, achieving maximum crop yield at minimum cost is a\
    \ produc-\ntion goal. In this context, decision-making is complex, as several\
    \ factors affect the entire\nprocess, aiming to save water resources, mainly on\
    \ irrigation.\nThe study of water in the soil is of great interest to agriculture\
    \ because it affects the\ndevelopment and production of crops. A developing plant\
    \ must supply the atmosphere’s\ndemand for water through the amount it can extract\
    \ from the soil. Soil water storage\nis reduced by evapotranspiration and replaced\
    \ by precipitation or irrigation. Thus, soil\nwater storage and availability in\
    \ crop production are valuable, and characterizing the\nsoil properties responsible\
    \ for water retention is crucial. The soil moisture is estimated\nusing three\
    \ tensiometers at different soil depths in each monitoring point, which is used\
    \ to\nestimate the soil matric potential. The matric potential is directly linked\
    \ to moisture; the\nmore humid the soil, the greater its potential [22].\nIrrigation\
    \ helps reserve enough water for the crop in its development stage. Its matric\n\
    potential is used in irrigation management to determine when to irrigate, the\
    \ amount of\nwater, and the type of irrigation. The water distribution is on-demand,\
    \ i.e., when water\nis always available by the irrigation project or pumped by\
    \ the user and used when the\ncrop needs.\nThe irrigation management determines\
    \ irrigation timing by monitoring the soil ma-\ntric potential (ψ) containing\
    \ the highest concentration of crop roots (usually in the most\nsuperﬁcial soil\
    \ tier, monitored by the tensiometer). Another way to determine the time to\n\
    irrigate is through the critical moisture θcr, also called ideal moisture for\
    \ irrigation. This\nparameter is the soil water content from which the crop yield\
    \ starts to be reduced, also\nhaving the possibility of evapotranspiration reduction\
    \ (water consumption by cultivation).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n8 of 22\nθcr is\
    \ only needed for the most superﬁcial soil tier. The evapotranspiration measures\
    \ the\nwater consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage of the\
    \ crop and weather\nconditions [22].\nAnother important variable to be considered\
    \ in view of the plant’s needs is the\nirrigation water need (IWN). The IWN consists\
    \ of the water provided entirely by irrigation\nto compensate for the water loss\
    \ due to evaporation. It is obtained through a calculation\nconsidering the rainfall,\
    \ water consumption, soil moisture at the crop root zone and the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ the irrigation system placed in the ﬁeld [22].\nSimilarly to the works in [23,24],\
    \ we can also detect anomalies in sensor measures\nby comparing with measures\
    \ from nearby sensors, in order to verify whether there was a\nsensor error, whether\
    \ there is any water leakage, or whether, for some reason, the soil is\ntoo dry.\n\
    Based on these concepts, we deﬁne the rules and events of the case study presented\
    \ in\nthe following sections.\n3.2. Rules and Events\nThe rules deﬁned to manage\
    \ the events are divided into two sets: monitoring rules\nand critical state rules.\
    \ Each rule consists of a set of events that are executed according to\nits pattern\
    \ and transformation primitives. These events are allocated to the tiers according\n\
    to the capacity of the devices so that the approach performance is not affected.\
    \ Thus,\nthey directly inﬂuence the process of decision making by the user and\
    \ also automatically\naccording to the system’s behavior.\n3.2.1. Monitoring Rules\n\
    The ﬁrst set of events of the monitoring rule are based on the primitives of ﬁltration,\n\
    aggregation, and projection. They are performed at the sensor tier. The projection\
    \ is\nresponsible for creating complex events (processed in the Fog tier) using\
    \ a subset of its\nattributes, generated by aggregation (average of values obtained\
    \ by the sensors) and by\nﬁltering (obtaining the maximum and minimum values).\
    \ The rule of this ﬁrst set was\ncomposed of the following events:\n•\nEV1 (Simple):\
    \ low matric potential alert;\n•\nEV2 (Simple): high matric potential alert;\n\
    •\nEV3 (Simple): daily matric potential sending alert + sensor ID.\nThe second\
    \ set is formed by simple and compound events based on the primitives of\naggregation,\
    \ enrichment, and composition performed in the Fog tier. Enrichment is the\nconference\
    \ of the data necessary for calculations. Composition is the computations made\n\
    from the data consulted. The events that compose this rule are:\n•\nEV4 (Complex):\
    \ matric potential variation ;\n•\nEV5 (Complex): daily irrigation water needed\
    \ (IWN);\n•\nEV6 (Complex): daily irrigation frequency veriﬁcation.\nThe outputs\
    \ of these events are messages displayed and sent to the user.\n3.2.2. Critical\
    \ State Rules\nThe critical state rule is composed of events based on the primitives\
    \ of enrichment,\ncomposition, negation and sequence performed at the Fog tier.\
    \ For the use of the sequence\nprimitive, an input control is necessary, which\
    \ can be done through a time window, using a\ntimestamp, or context, using an\
    \ event identiﬁer. This rule consists of the following events:\n•\nEV7 (Complex):\
    \ critical soil moisture (ideal for irrigation);\n•\nEV8 (Complex): maximum water\
    \ deﬁcit.\nThese events result in automatic actions in the monitored area.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n9 of 22\n3.3. CEP Architecture\nThe proposed complex events\
    \ processing (CEP) model is part of the data fusion\nmechanism to treat, analyze,\
    \ and react to data ﬂows as events. Event ﬂows are the primary\nsources of input\
    \ of the CEP model. The events are created through producers (sensors,\nusers)\
    \ that provide the data. The ﬂow of events is processed through the CEP event\n\
    processing agent, known as EPA. Speciﬁcally, the EPA follows the subsequent steps:\
    \ reacts\nto events, analyzes, and manipulates them according to deﬁned rules,\
    \ and, if necessary,\ngenerates derivative (complex) events for the consumers.\
    \ The EPA acts according to the\nprimitives deﬁned in each example, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3 and 4.\nFigure 3. CEP architecture and primitives.\nFigure 4. CEP\
    \ primitives CEP according with tiers.\nA CEP inference engine allows instantiating\
    \ the presented concepts. In addition, it\nprovides operations to deﬁne the types\
    \ of events (schema and payload) and primitives\nin real-time to express continuous\
    \ queries (PAEs) and interconnect them. The inference\nengines of the events are\
    \ shown in Section 3.3.1.\n3.3.1. Description of CEP Rules and Events\nWe show\

    \ to comple-\nment this set of rules and events. The event-processing programming\
    \ differs from regular\nprogramming and thus needs its own auditing tool. Auditing\
    \ is the ability to investigate\nwhether processes have been properly applied.\
    \ The investigation may refer to whether a\nprocess complies with external regulations\
    \ or internal policies or whether a decision has\nbeen appropriately made.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Auditing\nGiven the rules and events presented in Section 3.3.1, we performed\
    \ the auditing of\nthe CEP model using a static analysis of the network. The auditing\
    \ process for a CEP model\nis based on the event log, a list that retains the\
    \ raw and derived events performed in the\ngiven processing. The audit was made\
    \ based on consultations in this event log. The query\nis similar to the dynamic\
    \ analysis process of the validation process, as it depends on the\namount of\
    \ information from the execution of a given event.\nFor the auditing of the CEP\
    \ model, two primary consultations were performed based\non the concept presented\
    \ in [25]: (i) consult all antecedents of a given event or activation of\nan EPA\
    \ instance (rule); and (ii) consult all the consequences of a given event or activation\n\
    of an EPA instance (rule).\nWe can observe from these two main consultations that\
    \ the objective of the audit is\nto check the background and consequences of a\
    \ given processed event, i.e., to check the\nbackground of the ﬁnalizing events\
    \ and the consequences of the initial events. Thus, for the\nmodel applied to\
    \ the approach proposed in this article, it is necessary to audit the following\n\
    events:\n•\nConsult 1: EV4, EV6, EV7, and EV8.\n•\nConsult 2: EV1, EV2, and EV3.\n\
    Figures 5–7 present the logs of the consulted events. From the logs, we can verify\n\
    that event processing is meeting the application’s needs. Exemplifying the Event\
    \ 1 log\n(Figure 5), the expected performance according to the low matric potential\
    \ is irrigation\nunless a sensor malfunction has occurred. Then, following the\
    \ processing of event 1, it\nends by triggering event 4 in case the rule is activated.\
    \ Now, observing the log presented\nin Figure 6, we veriﬁed that this event ends\
    \ by exactly meeting the need to trigger event 1:\nor ends by sending a message\
    \ to the user informing of the sensor malfunction, or sending\na message to trigger\
    \ manual irrigation, or, ﬁnally, triggering event 8. Event 10 checks\nthe activation\
    \ of the EPA instance, testing the rule, and ends with the triggering of the\n\
    automatic irrigation or requesting that the same be done manually, as we can see\
    \ in the log\nof Figure 7.\nFigure 5. Log of events 1, 2, and 3.\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 7226\n12 of 22\nFigure 6. Log of event 4.\nFigure 7. Logs of events 6, 7,\
    \ and 8.\nThus, based on any consult executed in the logs presented, the application’s\
    \ need is\nsatisﬁed at the end of the processing—starting from event 2 (Figure\
    \ 5) and ending at event\n4 (Figure 6), etc. In this way, the audit of the CEP\
    \ model used in the proposed approach\nwas successfully satisﬁed.\n4. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the performed experiments. We divided them\
    \ into two experi-\nmental groups, with different goals. The ﬁrst group refers\
    \ to the experiments performed to\nanalyze the proposal’s performance using the\
    \ metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\ndata trafﬁc, and time to\
    \ send packages. The second group refers to the implementation\nof the rules responsible\
    \ for controlling the irrigation process, the validation of the soil\nmoisture\
    \ management, and the reaction time of the actuators to verify the response time\n\
    and the CEP efﬁciency. Table 2 summarizes the experiments, objectives, and metrics.\n\

    \ ﬁrst performance evaluation, executed to verify the quality\nof the decision\
    \ generated and the performance in terms of data trafﬁc and average sending\n\
    time with the application of the CEP approach. Both aspects are critical to assess\
    \ the\nperformance of the large-scale deployment of wireless sensors. To create\
    \ a proof of concept\n(PoC) of our proposal, we used a real coconut ﬁeld of Embrapa\
    \ Agroindustrial [26] as a\nmodel to simulate an environment for our experiments.\
    \ The experimental ﬁeld is located\nin Paraipaba-Ce.\nExperiment I: Design\nOur\
    \ simulated ﬁeld consists of 25 coconut trees, in which temperature sensors monitor\n\
    ﬁfteen trees, and soil moisture sensors monitor ten trees. In addition, ﬁve Fog\
    \ nodes\ncommunicating with the Cloud were implemented. Furthermore, we simulated\
    \ two other\nscenarios to verify the approach’s scalability by varying the number\
    \ of nodes as follows:\n(i) 50 sensor nodes (25 temperature, 25 soil moisture)\
    \ and 10 Fog nodes; and (ii) 100 sensor\nnodes (50 temperature, 50 soil moisture)\
    \ and 20 Fog nodes.\nWe used a discrete event simulator focused on, but not restricted\
    \ to, Fog environments,\ncalled Yet Another Fog Simulator (YAFS) to run the simulations.\
    \ YAFS was built to ana-\nlyze the application’s design and it incorporates strategies\
    \ for positioning, programming,\nand routing. YAFS has similar characteristics\
    \ to the iFogSim simulator and uses it as a\nreference [27]. According to [28],\
    \ iFogSim is one of the most widely used Fog simulators for\nscenario simulations\
    \ using Fog and Cloud computing. YAFS includes more functionality\nthan current\
    \ simulators for modeling IoT scenarios and is easier to add extensions. We\n\
    highlight the following points of YAFS:\n•\nIt provides a network vision that\
    \ allows the modeling of the communication links\namong machines, users and end-devices;\n\
    •\nEach workload source represents the connection of a user or an IoT sensor or\
    \ actuator\nthat demands a service and can be created, changed or dynamically\
    \ removed, enabling\nthe modeling of the user movements in an ecosystem;\n•\n\
    Custom processes can be invoked at runtime to provide ﬂexible implementations\
    \ of\nreal events;\n•\nIt provides post-simulation data analysis based on two\
    \ types of events: workload\ngeneration and computation, and link transmissions.\n\
    The sensor readings were carried out over a 20-min time frame so that we capture\n\
    the hourly average. Every twelve hours, the sensor node performs a simple aggregation\n\
    function, calculating the arithmetic mean. Then, each sensor sends the value to\
    \ its respective\nFog node. Then, the Fog node transforms the received data into\
    \ information using data\nfusion and CEP techniques such as ﬁltering and composing\
    \ complex events. CEP works\nas an inference engine, ﬁltering, correlating, and\
    \ composing new events based on the\ninformation obtained through the fusion of\
    \ the data. For example, after consecutive\nreadings of temperature values greater\
    \ than 29 ºC, an event is created that exhibits a\ntemperature alert message on\
    \ display. Likewise, a new event is created to send an urgent\nmessage to prevent\
    \ the soil from becoming too dry after displaying ﬁve messages without\nchange\
    \ in the monitored area (without action).\nThe sensor nodes have 16 MB RAM, while\
    \ Fog nodes have 4 GB and Cloud nodes\nhave 8 GB. These values were chosen to\
    \ be realistic, closer to the device’s conﬁguration\noften used. Thus, each sensor\
    \ node is connected to a Fog node, while each Fog node is\nconnected to the Cloud\
    \ node. For simulation purposes, only one Cloud node was used in\nall scenarios.\
    \ The parameters conﬁgured in the experiments performed are summarized in\nTable\
    \ 3.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n14 of 22\nTable 3. Experiments.\nExperiment\nScenario\n\

    \ decisions, the basic knowledge of\neach concept is necessary. False positives\
    \ and false negatives are illustrated utilizing\nthe confusion matrix, a table\
    \ indicating the errors and successes of the evaluated model,\ncomparing them\
    \ with the expected result. In this matrix, the following values are shown:\n\
    •\nTrue positive (TP): values that correspond to the positive of the value read;\
    \ in the case\nof the architecture presented, the value must be within the normal\
    \ temperature range\n(up to 29 ºC) and acceptable humidity (greater than or equal\
    \ to 60 KPa);\n•\nFalse negative (FN): error in which the model predicted a negative\
    \ result (that is,\noutside the normal temperature range or acceptable soil moisture)\
    \ when the real value\nwas within the positive range (described above);\n•\nFalse\
    \ positive (FP): error in which the model predicted a positive result when the\
    \ real\nvalue was within the negative range (that is, temperature > 29 ◦C or soil\
    \ moisture\n< 60 KPa);\n•\nTrue negative (TN): correct classiﬁcation of values\
    \ within the high temperature range\n(greater than 29 ◦C) or dry soil (less than\
    \ 60 KPa) before and after the data fusion\nis applied.\nWhen all the terms (TP,\
    \ FN, FP, and TN) are computed, resulting in the confusion\nmatrices, it is possible\
    \ to calculate the following metrics for assessing the quality of the\ndata: accuracy\
    \ (Ac); precision (P); recall (R); and F1-Score (F1) using the Equations (1)–(4):\n\
    Ac =\nTP + TN\nTP + FP + TN + FN\n(1)\nP =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(2)\nR =\nTP\nTP + FN\n\
    (3)\nF1 = 2 × P × R\nP + R\n(4)\nRegarding these metrics, accuracy provides a\
    \ general analysis of the model considering\nall the data collected; this metric\
    \ indicates the percentage of data that were correctly\nclassiﬁed. The precision\
    \ metric provides a percentage of how many positive instances were\ncorrectly\
    \ ranked, while the Recall metric was used to indicate the relationship between\n\
    positive predictions performed correctly and all data that are actually positive.\
    \ The F1-score\nmetric indicates the overall behavior of accuracy and recall.\
    \ If the F1-score is low, it is\nunderstood that one of the two metrics is low.\
    \ Regarding this last metric, it is important to\nhighlight the harmonic mean\
    \ of accuracy and recall. When the values are close, the result\nis similar to\
    \ the arithmetic mean [29].\n4.2. Experiment 2: Validation of CEP Model Implementation\
    \ and Reaction Time\nThis section presents the implementation of rules directly\
    \ linked to irrigation control\nand the validation of its effectiveness using\
    \ a program that simulates the sensors and the\nsoil matric potential values in\
    \ real time.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n15 of 22\nExperiment 2: Design\nFigure 8\
    \ shows the components implemented for Experiment 2, where sensors and\nactuators\
    \ nodes exchange information with the Fog tier. We used three soil moisture\n\
    sensors and an actuator that controls irrigation in the zone in the ﬁeld. We used\
    \ Python to\nsimulate both components, with soil conditions and moisture progression\
    \ according to the\nirrigation state (on or off). The Fog tier comprises two components:\
    \ a Rabbitmq messaging\nserver containing two queues (data input and output) and\
    \ a module dedicated to the data\nstream and complex event processing (CEP), which\
    \ was implemented using Apache Flink\nthe FlinkCEP library. Communication between\
    \ the Fog tier and the IoT nodes in the ﬁeld\nwas through the MQTT protocol. Rabbitmq\
    \ was chosen as the messaging service because\nthe tool provides a native plugin\
    \ that supports MQTT messages.\nFigure 8. Experiment 2: implementation of Fog\
    \ tier components.\nIn order to validate the effectiveness of the rules implemented\
    \ in Apache Flink in\ncontrolling irrigation, we programmed the sensors to send\
    \ the matric potential values\nevery minute to the Fog tier. Upon detecting event\
    \ 9 or 10, the irrigation was turned on. We\nused the value of 20 kPa as a reference\
    \ for the ideal value of matric potential as a trigger to\nturn off the irrigation.\
    \ We obtained this information from experts in the agricultural area.\n5. Results\n\
    5.1. Experiment I: Results and Discussion\nThis section presents the results of\
    \ the performance evaluation experiment concerning\nthe following metrics: false\
    \ positives, false negatives, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\nand data\
    \ trafﬁc. We use three scenarios as described below.\n5.1.1. Scenario A: 25 Sensor\
    \ Nodes, 5 Fog Nodes\nFrom the simulation of scenario A, we generate the confusion\
    \ matrix, presented in\nTable 4. The matrix presents the results regarding VP,\
    \ FP, FN, and VN from the comparison\nof the raw soil moisture data (generated\
    \ in the sensors) to the ﬁnal information provided\nby our fusion proposal. In\
    \ total, during the simulations performed, soil moisture sensors\ngenerate 360\
    \ readings.\nTable 4. Confusion matrix—soil moisture.\nAcceptable Moisture\nDry\

    \ the soil moisture data, we compared the raw\ntemperature data to the information\
    \ generated after applying the techniques. Based on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\
    16 of 22\nvalues found in the confusion matrices (Tables 4 and 5), the other metrics\
    \ were calculated\nand shown in Table 6.\nTable 5. Confusion matrix—temperature.\n\

    0.994\nPrecision\n1\n1\nRecall\n1\n0.993\nF1-Score\n1\n0.993\nAccording to the\
    \ results, our CEP approach presented 100% accuracy in the soil mois-\nture data\
    \ and approximately 99% in the temperature data. Accuracy provides information\n\
    about how much the false positive inﬂuences the information generated: the percentage\n\
    of correctness when the soil has a moisture and temperature considered adequate\
    \ for the\nplant, thus preventing the plant from being without its proper irrigation\
    \ and reducing its\nproductivity. Thus, the CEP approach presented a precision\
    \ of 100% for the two observed\ndata sets. Recall informs how the false-negative\
    \ has affected the results obtained. In our\nscenario, the recall informs the\
    \ amount of correctness regarding the need to use water.\nThe approach presented\
    \ a recall above 99% for the observed data, which prevents the plant\nfrom being\
    \ unnecessarily irrigated, thus saving water. The F1-Score is a harmonic mean\n\
    that veriﬁes the disparity between precision and recall, supplying greater credibility\
    \ to\nthe observed values. This metric checks whether the accuracy or recall is\
    \ well below the\nexpected value. The CEP approach obtained an F1-score of 99%,\
    \ thus showing that in all\naspects, our CEP approach provided very coherent information\
    \ when compared to the raw\nvalues generated by the sensors.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ data trafﬁc with and without the Fog tier and the processing\nof complex events.\
    \ It can be seen that the trafﬁc data decreases with the complex data\nprocessing\
    \ in the Fog tier.\nFigure 9. Data trafﬁc—scenario A.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\

    Observing the data trafﬁc in the simulated scenario (Figure 11), it is possible\
    \ to verify\nan average reduction of 82% when compared the use of CEP and fusion\
    \ techniques to the\nﬂow of the network without the use of the techniques.\nFigure\
    \ 11. Data trafﬁc—scenario C.\nAnother metric to be analyzed is the average time\
    \ to send a message to its ﬁnal\ndestination. By processing data obtained by the\
    \ fusion and the processing of events, some\ndata that would be initially sent\
    \ to the Cloud are treated and resolved in the previous tiers.\nOur results (Figure\
    \ 12) show that the average message sending time is 77% shorter when\nprocessing\
    \ is performed in the Fog tier without sending all data to the Cloud.\nFigure\

    \ and Discussion\nFigure 13 shows the behavior of the matric potential values\

    \ can conclude that the objective of\ncontrol in a simulated environment was achieved\
    \ since the value of the matric potential\nremained within the deﬁned limits.\n\

    \ control.\nThe second part of the experiment evaluated the response time of the\
    \ irrigation\nactivation in the actuator node by identifying the event in the\
    \ CEP engine. The response\ntime of thirty events was analyzed. Figure 14 shows\
    \ the test results. The average response\ntime obtained was approximately 7.15\
    \ ms on a local network.\nFigure 14. Actuator response time.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    We presented a multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach in Fog focused on the smart\n\
    agriculture domain. Our approach is geolocation and context-aware, in which the\
    \ new\nsensor nodes in a network connect to a Fog node based on the data type\
    \ and the Euclidean\ndistance between them. To evaluate the proposal, we performed\
    \ simulations in different\nscenarios with different network densities and conﬁgurations.\
    \ The experiments achieved\npromising results, such as accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-Score which were consistently\nabove 99%. Thus, we can claim that the\
    \ information obtained using the proposed approach\nis reliable and consistent\
    \ with the reality of the monitored environment. In order to\nvalidate the effectiveness\
    \ of the CEP engine (rules and events), we conducted tests using\nan irrigation\
    \ scenario and it was successfully completed.\nOur results show that the objective\
    \ of control in a simulated environment was achieved\nsince the value of the matric\
    \ potential remains within the deﬁned limits. The second part\nof the experiment\
    \ evaluated the response time of the irrigation activation in the actuator\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n21 of 22\nnode by identifying the event in the CEP engine. The\
    \ average response time obtained was\napproximately 7.15 milliseconds on a local\
    \ network, showing that the CEP engine meets\nthe application’s needs.\nIn future\
    \ work, we intend to investigate the self-conﬁguration of the nodes regard-\n\
    ing the best characteristics to be considered for the choice of the Fog node,\
    \ such as the\nprocessing power. Another point to be explored in future work is\
    \ the use of the data stream-\noriented CEP mechanism, which is similar to SQL,\
    \ instead of rule-oriented modeling.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Comments ABSTRACT The increasing pervasiveness of mobile and embedded devices
    (IoT/Edge), combined with the access to Cloud infrastructures, makes it possible
    to build scalable distributed systems, characterized by a multi-dimensional architecture.
    The overall picture is a massive collection of computing devices, characterized
    by very heterogeneous levels of performance and power consumption, which we could
    exploit to reduce the need to access Cloud computing resources. This would play
    a key role, especially for emerging use cases, where huge amount of data are generated.
    However, the deployment of distributed applications on such an heterogeneous infrastructures
    requires suitable management layers. This position paper aims at: (a) proposing
    a fully-distributed, cooperative, dynamic and multi-layered architecture, capable
    of integrating different computing paradigms; (b) identifying a possible solution
    to manage workloads at run-time in a resources continuity perspective, through
    an analysis of the open research challenges. References G. Agosta, W. Fornaciari,

    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Abstract: In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies,\
    \ have been\nprogressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These\
    \ and other digitalization-enabling\ntechnologies are generating a massive amount\
    \ of data with enormous potential to manage supply\nchains more efﬁciently and\
    \ sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded\n\
    in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis.\
    \ In such a data-\ndriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved\
    \ signiﬁcant momentum to analyze, mine,\nand extract the underlying data information,\
    \ or solve complex optimization problems, striking a\nbalance between productive\
    \ efﬁciency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some\nrecent studies\
    \ have sorted the CI literature in this ﬁeld, they are mainly oriented towards\
    \ a single\nfamily of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics)\
    \ and review their\napplication in speciﬁc FSC stages. As such, there is a gap\
    \ in identifying and classifying FSC problems\nfrom a broader perspective, encompassing\
    \ the various families of CI methods that can be applied in\ndifferent stages\
    \ (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these\
    \ stages\nfrom a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\n(associated with agriculture, ﬁsh farming, and livestock) from\
    \ a CI approach; that is, it deﬁnes FSC\nproblems (from production to retail)\
    \ and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from\na CI point of view.\
    \ Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in\neach\
    \ stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also\
    \ introduce a set of\nguidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to\
    \ decide on suitable families of methods when\naddressing any particular problems\
    \ they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy,\nwe identify\
    \ and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should\
    \ explore to\nenhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nKeywords: food supply chain; computational intelligence; fish farming;\
    \ agriculture; livestock; machine\nlearning; neural networks; deep learning; meta-heuristics;\
    \ fuzzy systems; probabilistic methods\n1. Introduction\nCurrently, one worldwide\
    \ challenge is how to sustainably guarantee global food needs\nin the face of\
    \ a growing population that is projected to be 9–10 billion by 2050 [1]. In this\n\
    sense, the enhancement of production and management of the current Food Supply\
    \ Chains\n(FSCs) is a crucial factor that contributes to accomplishing such an\
    \ aim. Nowadays, new\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) (e.g.,\
    \ the Internet of Things) play\nan active role in the digitization of FSCs [2].\
    \ As a result, large volumes of data are being\ngenerated in all FSC stages, ranging\
    \ from production to retail. The analysis of such data\nwould enable FSC actors\
    \ to extract relevant information or to optimize speciﬁc processes,\nallowing\
    \ improvement of the FSC administration, productivity, and sustainability.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the high volumes of available data and their complex patterns raise\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ challenges when analyzing and extracting values. In this context, Computational\n\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n2 of 34\nIntelligence (CI) seems to be a successful paradigm\
    \ to build intelligent systems that are\nable to leverage this high availability\
    \ of data. CI is the ability of a digital system or\nalgorithm to perform tasks\
    \ commonly associated with intelligent beings [3]. Within such\ntasks, we can\
    \ ﬁnd speech recognition, visual perception, decision-making, prediction, and\n\
    translation, among others [4]. Over the last few years, the number of academic\
    \ publications\nconcerning CI applied to FSC has rapidly increased [5–7]. Within\
    \ the most representative\nCI methods applied to FSCs, we ﬁnd Neural Networks,\
    \ Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence,\nor Probabilistic Reasoning.\nThe scientiﬁc\
    \ literature reports different studies that aim to review and order the\napplication\
    \ of CI methods in different FSC stages. The variety of CI methods has led to\
    \ the\nemergence of research papers (published between 2012 and 2020), which select\
    \ a partic-\nular family of CI techniques and review their application in speciﬁc\
    \ FSC stages [2,6–12].\nHowever, these papers focus on only one or two families\
    \ of CI methods at most, and in the\nmajority of cases, do not cover all FSC stages.\
    \ Therefore, there is a lack of comprehensive\nstudies that review the application\
    \ of the most important families of CI methods in all FSC\nstages (from production\
    \ to retail). Additionally, few efforts have been made to classify FSC\nproblems\
    \ from a CI perspective. Hence, there is no categorization of the typologies of\
    \ FSC\nproblems to help determine how they can be modeled from a CI view (e.g.,\
    \ optimization,\nuncertain knowledge handling, reasoning) and what CI methods\
    \ can be most suitably used\nto approach them. Thus, despite the progress made\
    \ in organizing and systematizing the\nexisting literature at the point where\
    \ CI and FSCs meet, to the best of our knowledge, no\ntaxonomy has been proposed\
    \ in this regard.\nWith the above-mentioned ideas in mind, we propose a novel\
    \ taxonomy of FSC\nproblems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the\
    \ supply chain of agriculture,\nﬁsh farming, and livestock. The latter is justiﬁed\
    \ based on the fact that these supply chains\nprovide most of the food consumed\
    \ by the population of the world [13] and, therefore, they\nare the most studied\
    \ and researched FSCs in the scientiﬁc and academic literature. The\nmain contributions\
    \ of this article are:\n•\nA new taxonomy that provides a comprehensive view of\
    \ different FSC problems\nlocated in the chain stages typically studied in the\
    \ scientiﬁc literature (production,\nprocessing, distribution, and retail). This\
    \ taxonomy represents a new and broader\nproposal in order to identify and deﬁne\
    \ FSC problems that have been approached\nusing CI in the four aforementioned\
    \ stages. Besides, although some research articles\nhave described diverse FSC\
    \ problems, their deﬁnitions are not uniﬁed and vary\nfrom one paper to another.\
    \ Thus, this taxonomy also represents an effort to unify\nand consolidate deﬁnitions\
    \ of the FSC problems available in the literature, which\nrepresents a valuable\
    \ source of information for FSC researchers and practitioners\nworking in this\
    \ domain.\n•\nTo classify the FSC problems from a CI perspective. This classiﬁcation\
    \ allows FSC\nproblems to be mapped into common categories of problems in the\
    \ CI domain. Thus,\nwe provide a framework that helps display the similarities\
    \ and differences among\nFSC problems depending on how they can be modeled under\
    \ a CI perspective. To the\nbest of our knowledge, in this regard, no classiﬁcation\
    \ has been previously proposed.\n•\nTo establish a set of guidelines for the use\
    \ of CI in the FSC ﬁeld. These guidelines\naim to help FSC researchers and practitioners\
    \ to identify which FSC problems can\nbe addressed using CI, and the most appropriate\
    \ families of techniques to solve\nthem. Thus, these guidelines represent a ﬁrst\
    \ attempt to deﬁne a general framework\nto support the model selection problem\
    \ at the point where the ﬁelds of FSC and\nCI converge.\n•\nTo identify and discuss\
    \ challenges and research opportunities in the FSC domain,\nwhich are directed\
    \ towards more robust, explainable, interoperable, and accurate CI\nsolutions\
    \ that support FSC management and operation.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 provides background in-\nformation on FSC and CI to facilitate\
    \ the understanding of the article. Furthermore, it\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n\
    3 of 34\nsummarizes other efforts directed at reviewing and categorizing the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature at\nthe point where FSC and CI meet in order to highlight how this\
    \ paper complements and\nenhances previous studies. Section 3 presents the proposed\
    \ taxonomy, its structure, and the\nclassiﬁcation of FSC from a CI perspective.\
    \ Afterwards, Section 4 gives FSC researchers and\npractitioners a set of guidelines\
    \ for the use of CI within the FSC domain. Lastly, Section 5\nsummarizes the main\
    \ conclusions and sets a research agenda for CI in the FSC ﬁeld.\n2. Background\
    \ and Motivation\nThis section provides some contextual and relevant background\
    \ information to facili-\ntate the understanding of the paper, and to assess similar\
    \ studies in this area. We start by\nintroducing the basic FSC stages examined\
    \ in this study (Section 2.1). Then, Section 2.2\npresents the main families of\
    \ CI approaches typically considered in FSC research. Finally,\nSection 2.3 reviews\
    \ similar works at the point where FSC and CI converge, which have\nidentiﬁed\
    \ and classiﬁed CI-based problems and methods. Section 2 ends with a discussion\n\
    of the main contributions of this research article.\n2.1. Food Supply Chain\n\
    FSC refers to the system that encompasses all activities, organizations, actors,\
    \ tech-\nnologies, information, resources, and services involved in producing\
    \ agri-food products for\nconsumer markets (e.g., fresh food, meat, and processed\
    \ food products) [14]. The upstream\nand downstream sectors form the supply of\
    \ agricultural inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers,\nfeed, medicine, or equipment)\
    \ to production, post-harvest handling, processing, transporta-\ntion, marketing,\
    \ distribution, and retailing [15]. They also include support services such as\n\
    extension services, research and development, and market information.\nBefore\
    \ the ﬁnal consumption of food products, FSC can include diverse stages wherein\n\
    production, processing, distribution, and retail are the stages most commonly\
    \ studied in\nthe scientiﬁc literature [16]. First, the production stage forms\
    \ the initial set of processes to\nobtain raw products derived from agriculture,\
    \ ﬁsh farming, or livestock. Agriculture refers\nto farming applications, including\
    \ the cultivation of soils for the harvest of crops [17]. Fish\nfarming involves\
    \ raising ﬁsh commercially in tanks or ﬁsh ponds, usually for consumer\nmarkets\
    \ [18]. Meanwhile, livestock is devoted to practices related to animal husbandry\
    \ for\nmeat, milk, eggs, or wool [19]. Continuing further down the production\
    \ chain, we ﬁnd\nthe processing stage, wherein the produced raw materials are\
    \ exposed to diverse transfor-\nmation processes (e.g., meat curing, washing and\
    \ disinfecting vegetables, fermentation),\nwhich allow consumable food products\
    \ to be obtained.\nOnce food products are ready to be delivered to the end-users,\
    \ the following FSC\nstages are distribution and retail. Their main purpose is\
    \ to connect the production and\nprocessing stages with the food users to complete\
    \ the supply chain loop [16]. Consequently,\nin the distribution stage, the processed\
    \ food is sent to distribution centers and warehouses.\nFrom such locations, different\
    \ distribution channels start to deliver the products to retail\nstores for sale.\
    \ Thus, retail is the end stage of the FSC and represents the link to consumers.\n\
    FSCs consist of a wide range of enterprises, ranging from smallholders, farmers’\n\
    organizations, co-operatives, and start-up companies to multinational enterprises\
    \ through\nparent companies or their local afﬁliates [14,15]. In this context,\
    \ FSC companies relate\nto each other through a variety of arrangements. Downstream\
    \ companies in the supply\nchain may engage in various types of relationships\
    \ with producers to secure access to\nagricultural products. They can impose standards\
    \ and speciﬁcations on producers with\nlittle involvement beyond a buying contract.\
    \ However, they can also become more actively\ninvolved, particularly through\
    \ contract farming, to coordinate production and ensure\nquality and safety [14].\
    \ In the new circular chain schemes, this type of relationship becomes\nmore complex,\
    \ involving more than one enterprise from the chain in the decision-making\nprocess\
    \ [20].\nCurrently, an appropriate and effective strategy to address this challenge\
    \ is the digiti-\nzation of FSCs, both of their internal processes and of their\
    \ relationships with other actors\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n4 of 34\nin the chain\
    \ [2]. Digitization has led to the generation of big volumes of data throughout\
    \ the\nentire supply chain. The exploitation of such data would allow FSC actors\
    \ to extract knowl-\nedge that could improve their internal processes in terms\
    \ of productivity and sustainability,\nas well as that of the FSC as a whole.\
    \ However, the data obtained through digitization\nusually contain complex and\
    \ intricate patterns that stand out as diverse challenges for\nprocessing and\
    \ analysis to extract value from it. Thus, CI arises as a solution that could\n\
    leverage and mine the underlying patterns of such data in order to obtain the\
    \ maximum\nvalue of the information, according to the analyses made.\n2.2. Computational\
    \ Intelligence Approaches\nCI is centered on the ability of a computer or algorithm\
    \ to learn speciﬁc tasks (e.g.,\npattern recognition, forecasting) from data that\
    \ is typically related to experimental observa-\ntions without human intervention\
    \ [3]. In the context of FSC, diverse IoT devices and data\nmanagement systems\
    \ sense and gather such data, which they then deploy in each supply\nchain stage.\
    \ After obtaining data, different CI approaches are used to process, analyze,\
    \ and\nextract information. In this section, we introduce the relevant background\
    \ information in\nrelation to families of CI-based methods that are typically\
    \ used in FSC applications. Fol-\nlowing the guidelines and classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in [3], we have grouped the CI methods\ninto ﬁve families that are presented\
    \ in more detail below. They are CI-based Statistical\nLearning Methods, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks and Deep Learning, CI-based Optimization\nMethods, Fuzzy Systems,\
    \ and Probabilistic Reasoning. These groups of CI-based methods\nare presented\
    \ below.\n2.2.1. CI-Based Statistical Learning Methods\nStatistical Learning Methods,\
    \ also known as Machine Learning (ML) methods are\nalgorithms that are able to\
    \ learn a speciﬁc task without being explicitly programmed. More\nformally, according\
    \ to Mitchell [21], these types of methods learn from experiences E,\nrelated\
    \ to a task T, and their performance is evaluated by a metric P. The performance\
    \ in T\nimproves according to P, with experience E. Classically, these methods\
    \ can be classiﬁed\naccording to the three basic learning approaches presented\
    \ below: unsupervised learning,\nsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\
    Unsupervised learning looks for patterns in data with no pre-existing labels.\
    \ Its\ncentral approach is usually focused on organizing X data points into speciﬁc\
    \ groups [22].\nData points that are in the same group should have similar properties,\
    \ while data points\nin different groups should have highly different features.\
    \ It is important to note that\nthese potential groups are not previously deﬁned\
    \ and it is the purpose of unsupervised\nlearning algorithms to discover them.\
    \ Some examples of unsupervised learning methods\nare hierarchical clustering,\
    \ k-means, anomaly detection techniques, among others.\nSupervised learning is\
    \ the other fundamental area of Statistical Learning Methods [23].\nIt consists\
    \ of algorithms that learn a function ( f : X 7→ Y) by training with a ﬁnite number\n\
    of input-output pairs, X being the input domain and X the output co-domain. This\
    \ learning\nstage can be seen as E in Mitchell’s deﬁnition [21], and the speciﬁc\
    \ task T usually involves\npredicting an output given a new and unseen input [24].\
    \ Common families of methods that\nstand out in supervised learning are decision\
    \ tree-based (e.g., Decision Tree, Extra Trees),\ninstance-based (e.g., K-Nearest\
    \ Neighbors), kernel-based (e.g., Support Vector Machine), or\nensemble-based\
    \ methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost).\nSupervised learning problems can usually\
    \ be divided into classiﬁcation and regres-\nsion [25,26]. In both cases, the\
    \ basis is an input data-set, X, and their difference is the\ntype of target variable,\
    \ Y, to be predicted. In the classiﬁcation case, Y is divided into\ndiscrete categories,\
    \ while in regression, the aim is to predict continuous values. Standard\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ problems can be either binary or multi-class problems [27]. In the former\n\
    case, an instance can only be associated with one of two values: the positive\
    \ or negative\nequivalent to 0 or 1; whereas, in multi-class problems, there are\
    \ more than two classes\nunder consideration. A multi-class problem means that\
    \ a given instance belongs to one of\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n5 of 34\nthe multiple\
    \ possible categories. Diversely, a supervised regression problem [28] consists\n\
    of ﬁnding a function that can predict, for a given example, a real value in R.\n\
    The third learning approach is reinforcement learning [29]. In this case, the\
    \ focus is\non developing a learning agent able to observe the environment and\
    \ obtain some input\nfrom it. Then, the agent makes an action and it changes to\
    \ a new environment, receiving an\nevaluation value (award or penalty) related\
    \ to the action made. Unlike the unsupervised\nlearning approach, the agent receives\
    \ guidance from an external evaluation. Moreover,\ndifferent to supervised learning,\
    \ in reinforcement learning, the agent is provided with an\nevaluation value regarding\
    \ the action made and not with a clear speciﬁcation about the\ncorrespondence\
    \ between input and output data. Relevant approaches within reinforcement\nlearning\
    \ are value-based [30], policy-based [31], and model-based [32].\nLastly, it is\
    \ important to note that Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are not considered within\n\
    this family of methods. We will treat them as a separate class of methods because\
    \ of their\nimportant role in CI.\n2.2.2. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n\
    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems with an inner structure\n\
    that is based on a set of connected units, named neurons, as they are inspired\
    \ by a biological\nbrain. Just as is the case for animals, wherein two neurons\
    \ are connected by means of a link\n(synapses), the neurons of an ANN are connected\
    \ through edges that transmit signals from\none artiﬁcial neuron to another. The\
    \ signals transferred between neurons are represented by\nreal numbers, and the\
    \ output of each neural unit is computed by some non-linear function\nof the sum\
    \ of its inputs.\nEvery edge that connects two neurons (usually) has a weight\
    \ that is adjusted as the\nlearning process of the ANN is underway. The role of\
    \ such edges is to increase or decrease\nthe strength of the signal at the connection\
    \ of two neurons. Additionally, neural units are\naggregated into layers, and\
    \ they may carry out diverse transformations on the inputs that\nthey receive.\
    \ Thus, the purpose of ANNs is to process input data from the ﬁrst layer (input\n\
    layer) to the last layer (output layer), while approximating linear or non-linear\
    \ functions\nthat are generally unknown. The collection of neuron units arranged\
    \ in layers, edges, and\nweights forms a network topology that is usually called\
    \ an architecture (Figure 1). ANNs\nhave evolved into a broad family of architectures\
    \ that depend on the speciﬁc application\ndomain. The feed-forward neural network\
    \ is a type of classical architecture. In this network,\nthe input data moves\
    \ from the input layer directly through any hidden layers (intermediate\nlayers\
    \ located in-between the input and output layers) to the output layer.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Basic architecture of an ANN. It is composed of edges and neural units arranged\
    \ using\nan input layer (blue neural units), a hidden layer (white neural units),\
    \ and an output layer (yellow\nneural units).\nBecause of their ability to reproduce\
    \ and model nonlinear processes, ANNs have been\napplied in diverse supervised\
    \ learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning\nproblems. Application\
    \ areas may include time series forecasting, pattern recognition, signal\nclassiﬁcation,\
    \ among others. However, as more complex problems (e.g., image processing,\nspeech\
    \ recognition) have arisen in the last few years, further development in the ANN\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n6 of 34\narea is required to deal with resulting challenges.\
    \ The common denominator of these ﬁelds\nis the high complexity and enormous volumes\
    \ of data generated and managed in them.\nAs a result, a subset of ANNs, named\
    \ Deep Learning (DL) [33] has emerged to cope with\nthis complexity.\nA deep neural\
    \ network is a classical ANN composed of multiple layers between the\ninput and\
    \ output layers. Theoretically, DL architectures allow any non-linear function\
    \ to be\napproximated [34]. Therefore, this approach has become dominant in multiple\
    \ application\nﬁelds like computer vision [35] and natural language processing\
    \ [36]. Between the most\ncommon deep neural networks, we can ﬁnd recurrent neural\
    \ networks, convolutional\nneural networks, and long short-term memory neural\
    \ networks [37]. The main strength\nof this approach lies in its ability to learn\
    \ automatically from raw data and to learn more\ncomplex representations of data\
    \ than other Statistical Learning methods [38]. The latter\ncould be valuable\
    \ for research areas characterized by having complex data, which can\nbarely be\
    \ analyzed by human reasoning and classical data preprocessing approaches. The\n\
    other relevant characteristics of Deep neural architectures come from their architectural\n\
    ﬂexibility that enables data fusion, as they allow different data formats to merge,\
    \ combining\ndata from multiple sources and therefore extracting more valuable\
    \ knowledge. In other\nwords, DL facilitates the use of multi-dimensional data,\
    \ which is quite difﬁcult to achieve\nwith classical ANNs and ML methods.\n2.2.3.\
    \ CI-Based Optimization Methods\nThe growing computational capabilities and the\
    \ fact that some problems of great\npractical value (e.g., scheduling, routing,\
    \ facility location) can not be solved optimally\n(because they are NP-Hard problems)\
    \ has led to increased use of approximating algorithms.\nMeta-heuristics are a\
    \ suitable approach in situations where exact algorithms can not give an\nanswer\
    \ using a reasonable amount of time or memory [39]. These methods arose with the\n\
    idea of extracting the best parts of different successful heuristics to create\
    \ generic methods\nthat could be applied to a more signiﬁcant number of problems\
    \ and contexts. Due to the\nwide variety of meta-heuristics, different classiﬁcation\
    \ categories have been proposed [40].\nWe group these techniques according to\
    \ the next categories: Evolutionary Computation\n(EC) [41], Swarm Intelligence\
    \ (SI) [42], and other meta-heuristics (local search-based meta-\nheuristics [43]).\
    \ These groups are presented with more detail as follows.\nEC is a group of meta-heuristic\
    \ optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolu-\ntion. Within this family\
    \ of methods, they operate from an initial set of candidate solutions\n(initial\
    \ generation), which are updated in an iterative way. Then, each new generation\n\
    is generated by randomly removing candidate solutions according to predeﬁned criteria\n\
    and by inserting random changes. After a set of iterations, the population of\
    \ solutions\nwill gradually evolve to increase its competitiveness, framed by\
    \ a ﬁtness function that is\ndetermined by each algorithm. Following the described\
    \ procedure, EC algorithms can\nproduce highly optimized solutions for complex\
    \ real-world optimization problems like the\ntraveling salesman problem [44].\
    \ Some well-known examples of EC meta-heuristics are\nGenetic algorithms [45]\
    \ and Differential evolution [46], among others.\nThe second biggest category\
    \ of meta-heuristics is the category of Swarm Intelligence\n(SI). This approach\
    \ consists of a population of agents interacting with each other and their\nenvironment.\
    \ The agents follow a set of basic rules, and although there is no centralized\n\
    control structure guiding the agents on how they should behave, the interaction\
    \ between\nthem leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior. SI is inspired\
    \ by biological\nsystems such as ant and bee colonies and is commonly used to\
    \ solve combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimization problems (e.g., shortest path\
    \ problems for delivery or optimization\nof unknown parameters in time series).\
    \ Two of the most well-known SI algorithms are Ant\nColony [47], and Particle\
    \ Swarm [48] methods.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n7 of 34\nThe third category groups\
    \ together the rest of the meta-heuristics, which are outside\nof the domains\
    \ of EC and SI but are still relevant for solving optimization problems. For\n\
    example, this is the case for local search-based meta-heuristics that are focused\
    \ on ﬁnding\na solution that maximizes a criterion among a set of candidate solutions.\
    \ These meta-\nheuristics move from one solution to another in the search space\
    \ of candidate solutions\nby applying local changes until an optimal solution\
    \ is found or a time budget is reached.\nWithin this category of meta-heuristics,\
    \ representative methods include Tabu Search [49],\nand Greedy Randomized Adaptive\
    \ Search Procedure (also known as GRASP) [50].\n2.2.4. Fuzzy Systems\nClassical\
    \ logic is based on the crisp set concept, where a group of objects is considered\n\
    to be a collection. In this sense, a crisp subset can be deﬁned from a broader\
    \ set where its\nelements belong to the subset according to some particular condition.\
    \ Thus, we can deﬁne\nthe concept of membership wherein a value of one is assigned\
    \ to the elements of the subset\nand a value of zero to the elements that do not\
    \ belong to that subset. Unlike crisp sets, a\nfuzzy set allows partial belonging\
    \ to a set through a degree of membership, denoted by\na function µ, that maps\
    \ all the elements in the set to a value in the real interval between\nzero and\
    \ one [51]. Then, as in the crisp case, a value of zero means that the element\
    \ under\nconsideration does not belong to the set, and a value of one represents\
    \ that the element\nbelongs entirely to the set. However, unlike in the crisp\
    \ case, a value greater than zero\nand lower than one represents a partial membership\
    \ to the subset. Consequently, the set’s\nmembership function is the relationship\
    \ between the elements of the set and their degree\nof belonging.\nHaving introduced\
    \ the basic notions of fuzzy sets, the next key concept is fuzzy\ninference systems.\
    \ A fuzzy system is a repository of fuzzy expert knowledge that can\nreason the\
    \ data in vague terms instead of precise Boolean logic. This expert knowledge\
    \ is a\ncollection of fuzzy membership functions and a set of fuzzy rules that\
    \ is formed as follows:\nIF (conditions are fulﬁlled) THEN (consequences are inferred).\
    \ The basic conﬁguration of a\nfuzzy system is shown in Figure 2, and it can be\
    \ divided into four main parts: a fuzziﬁer, a\nknowledge base, an inference engine,\
    \ and a defuzziﬁer [52].\nFigure 2. Structure and components of a Fuzzy System.\n\
    The Fuzziﬁer maps a real crisp input to a fuzzy function and, therefore, determines\n\
    the degree of membership of the input to a vague concept (categories using the\
    \ fuzzy sets).\nThe values of the input variables are mapped to the range of values\
    \ of the corresponding\nuniverse of discourse. The range and resolution of input-fuzzy\
    \ sets and their effect on the\nfuzziﬁcation process are considered to be factors\
    \ that affect the overall performance of\nthe system.\nThe knowledge base comprises\
    \ the knowledge of the application domain. It can be\nsplit into a database of\
    \ deﬁnitions used to express linguistic control rules in the controller\nand a\
    \ rule base that describes the knowledge held by the experts in the domain. Intuitively,\n\
    the knowledge base is the core element of a fuzzy controller as it will contain\
    \ all the\ninformation necessary to accomplish its execution tasks.\nThe Inference\
    \ Engine provides the decision-making logic of the controller. It deduces\nthe\
    \ fuzzy control actions by employing fuzzy implications and fuzzy rules of inference.\
    \ In\nmany aspects, it can be viewed as an emulation of human decision-making.\
    \ Finally, the\nDefuzziﬁcation process converts fuzzy control values into crisp\
    \ quantities; that is, it links\na single point to a fuzzy set, given that the\
    \ point belongs to the support of the fuzzy set.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n8 of\
    \ 34\nThere are many de-fuzziﬁcation techniques, the most famous being the center-of-area\
    \ or\ncenter-of-gravity.\n2.2.5. Probabilistic Reasoning\nProbabilistic Reasoning\
    \ states that users can infer plausible models to explain input\ndata. Thus, a\
    \ model can predict an output based on new, unknown input data, which allows\n\
    decisions to be made regarding future actions. In this context of predictions,\
    \ uncertainty\nplays a relevant role for three reasons [53]. First, uncertainty\
    \ can be introduced from noisy\ninput data into the training process of a model.\
    \ Secondly, input data can be consistent with\ndifferent models, and therefore\
    \ which model is more appropriate for the data at hand is\nuncertain. And third,\
    \ a model can have diverse parameters (e.g., the coefﬁcients of linear\nregression)\
    \ and/or different inner structures (e.g., the architecture of ANNs); hence, there\n\
    is uncertainty regarding the speciﬁcations for a concrete model [54].\nFrom a\
    \ general perspective, the basic foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning are\n\
    condensed in the Bayesian learning paradigm [54]. Primarily, probability distributions\
    \ are\nconsidered to represent all uncertainties that can interfere in a model\
    \ (e.g., noise in the input\ndata, the model’s parameters). Then, the basic rules\
    \ of probability theory are considered\nto infer unobserved quantities given the\
    \ observed data. Thus, the process of learning\nfrom data occurs through the transformation\
    \ of the prior probability distributions (deﬁned\nbefore having the input data)\
    \ into posterior distributions (after observing the data).\nThe assumptions mentioned\
    \ above are supported by two of the basic rules of prob-\nability theory. They\
    \ are the sum rule and the product rule, which can be expressed as\nP(x) = ∑y∈Y\
    \ P(x, y) and P(x, y) = P(x)P(y | x), respectively. Here x and y correspond to\n\
    observed or uncertain quantities, taking values in sets X and Y. P(x) is the probability\
    \ of x\nregarding the frequency of observing a particular value. P(x, y) is the\
    \ joint probability of\nobserving x and y, and P(y|x) is the probability of y\
    \ conditioned on observing a concrete x\nvalue. Keeping these two probability\
    \ theory rules in mind, x and y can be integrated into\nthe Bayes’ theorem to\
    \ describe the probability of an event based on the prior knowledge\nof conditions\
    \ that might be related to the event. In the context of Statistical Learning,\
    \ this\ntheorem is stated as P(θ | D, m) = P(D|θ,m)P(θ|m)\nP(D|m)\n. Here, P(D\
    \ | θ, m) is the likelihood of\nparameters θ in model m, P(θ | m) is the prior\
    \ probability of θ, and P(θ | D, m) is the\nposterior probability of θ given data\
    \ x.\nThus, learning is the transformation of prior knowledge or assumptions regarding\
    \ the\nparameters P(θ | m), through data D, into the posterior knowledge about\
    \ the parameters\nP(θ | D, m). Such a posterior distribution then becomes prior\
    \ knowledge for future data\npredictions. Within this framework, the most typical\
    \ methods used over the last few years\nwere Bayesian networks [55]. Other representative\
    \ techniques are Markov networks and\nRandom Fields [56].\n2.2.6. Summary of CI-Based\
    \ Approaches\nHaving presented the families of CI methods usually considered in\
    \ FSC, this section\nintroduces a summary of the methods presented above and their\
    \ strengths and weak-\nnesses (Table 1). First of all, we would like to point\

    \ are two-fold. First, it reviews the related work at the\npoint where FSC and\
    \ CI meet, in order to identify previous contributions regarding the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ of FSC problems, and the CI methods used to solve them. Having already\nintroduced\
    \ these previous studies, the ﬁnal part of this section is devoted to presenting\
    \ the\nmain novelty and contributions of this paper.\nIn 2012, Grifﬁs et al. [11]\
    \ focused on the distribution stage of an FSC to present an\noverview of CI-based\
    \ optimization methods that can play a relevant role for problems like\nvehicle\
    \ routing, supply chain risks, and disruptions. The authors emphasized how meta-\n\
    heuristic techniques provide near-optimal solutions to logistics problems. Following\
    \ this\nline of research, in 2016, Wari and Zhu [12] presented an updated survey\
    \ on applying meta-\nheuristics to solve optimization problems in the processing\
    \ (e.g., fermentation, thermal\ndrying, and distillation) and distribution (e.g.,\
    \ warehousing location, production planning,\nand scheduling) stages of an FSC.\
    \ More recently, in 2017, Kamilaris et al. [7] reviewed\narticles on smart farming\
    \ to show how digital technologies can enhance the circularity of\nthe FSC at\
    \ the production stage. They highlighted the problems that can be approached by\n\
    utilizing CI-based Statistical Learning, ANNs, and DL methods.\nComplementary\
    \ to the advances reported by Kamilaris et al. [7], in 2020, Sharma et al. [15]\n\
    and Misra et al. [2] carried out a bibliometric analysis and a review, respectively,\
    \ of CI-\nbased Statistical Learning applications over the whole FSC. Based on\
    \ their results, the\nauthors designed a series of recommendations to design and\
    \ deploy Statistical Learning-\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n10 of 34\nbased solutions\
    \ for data-driven decision-making processes in the FSC. In the same year,\nCamarena\
    \ [10] made a critical analysis of what can be done with Artiﬁcial Intelligence,\n\
    without emphasizing any single method in particular, for the transition to a sustainable\n\
    FSC. Lastly, the studies of Liakos et al. [6] and Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Mas [9],\
    \ in 2018 and\n2020, respectively, presented comprehensive reviews of research\
    \ directed at the application\nof ML in the FSC production stage. The authors\
    \ surveyed how ML can help farmers make\nmore informed decisions on the management\
    \ of agriculture and livestock systems.\nFigure 3 presents a synthesis of the\
    \ studies described above and highlights how this\narticle complements and extends\
    \ the existing literature. Each cited paper is represented\nby a grey circle,\
    \ which can have one or two inner circles (green and blue). Green circles\nrepresent\
    \ FSC stages covered by a study, while blue circles depict the CI approaches\n\
    considered within it. The size of the circle is determined by the number of FSC\
    \ stages and\nCI techniques considered in each article. Thus, a green circle would\
    \ have the biggest size if\nthe paper to which it belongs addresses the four basic\
    \ stages of the FSC. The same logic is\nused for the blue circles: the more families\
    \ of methods a paper considers, the bigger the\ncircle’s size would be. Furthermore,\
    \ we can ﬁnd our research article in the center of the\nﬁgure in the violet circle.\n\
    Figure 3. Motivations and state-of-the-art concepts at the point where FSC and\
    \ CI meet.\nAccording to Figure 3 we can see that there are no research articles\
    \ that present a\ncomprehensive taxonomy at the point where FSC problems and CI\
    \ converge. This means\nthat there are no research studies that consider the problems\
    \ of the four basic FSC stages,\nnor the diversity of the CI methods that can\
    \ be applied to solve them. Instead, most of the\npapers focus on one or two FSC\
    \ stages, and they tend to review the role a unique CI family\nof methods has\
    \ over them. Therefore, we propose a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete\
    \ FSC and the ﬁve families of CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n11 of 34\nFurthermore, our proposal extends the previous\
    \ classiﬁcation efforts by adding a new\ncategorization attribute, which indicates\
    \ the type of FSC problem being addressed from\na CI perspective. In addition\
    \ to increasing the classiﬁcation capacity of our taxonomy,\nthis attribute allows\
    \ us to establish a novel mapping between the FSC problems and the\ntypologies\
    \ of CI problems that can be used to approach the former ones. By doing so,\n\
    we contribute to facilitating the choice of the most convenient family of CI methods\
    \ to\nuse depending on the FSC problem at hand. This represents a valuable and\
    \ novel source\nof information for FSC researchers and practitioners who aim to\
    \ incorporate CI-based\nsolutions into their FSC applications.\n3. A Taxonomy\
    \ of CI-Based Problems in the Food Supply Chain\nThis section introduces details\
    \ of the taxonomy proposed. First, Section 3.1 presents\nthe methodology followed\
    \ to design the taxonomy. Then, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 show the\ntaxonomy’s structure\
    \ and describe its parts. Finally, Section 3.5 gives an overview of the\ncategorization\
    \ of FSC problems, from a CI perspective, using the taxonomy.\n3.1. Methodology\
    \ for the Design of the Taxonomy\nThis section introduces the methodology followed\
    \ to build the taxonomy proposed.\nFirst, we note that this research paper does\
    \ not aim to carry out a systematic literature\nreview or survey. Instead, our\
    \ scope lies in searching and reviewing the representative\nliterature to propose\
    \ a taxonomy that describes and categorizes FSC problems and how\nthey are solved\
    \ from a CI-based perspective. As such, the taxonomy proposed does not seek\n\
    to identify all details associated with the FSC problems to maintain its comprehensibility\n\
    and size. It is designed according to core characteristics that may alter the\
    \ complexity and\nmodeling of FSC problems from the CI perspective.\nWith these\
    \ ideas in mind, Figure 4 shows the methodology followed to build the\ntaxonomy\
    \ introduced in this research paper. This methodology follows a structure-based\n\
    literature review that includes the steps depicted in Figure 4. The ﬁrst step\
    \ is named Scope\n& Research Question, which aims to limit the areas of knowledge\
    \ to be consulted; that is,\nthe point where FSC and CI converge. For this step,\
    \ the research questions that guided\nour search were: “What are the most common\
    \ FSC problems reported in the literature?”,\n“What are the CI methods typically\
    \ used to approach these problems?”, “How can FSC\nbe categorized from a CI perspective?”,\
    \ and “Is there any taxonomy to categorize FSC\nproblems considering a CI approach?”.\n\
    Figure 4. Steps followed to build the proposed taxonomy.\nThe following step deﬁned\
    \ the search set-up. We deﬁne the keywords, periods,\nonline resources, and criteria\
    \ to search and review the scientiﬁc literature. The keywords\nconsidered were:\
    \ Food Supply Chain(s), agrifood, ﬁsh farming, agriculture, livestock,\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n12 of 34\nproduction, processing, distribution, logistics, retail,\
    \ computational intelligence machine\nlearning, deep learning, meta-heuristics,\
    \ fuzzy systems, and probabilistic methods. The\nperiod was between 2012 and 2020,\
    \ and the bibliographic resources searched were the\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and\
    \ Google Scholar. Finally, the main criteria for selecting and\nreviewing the\
    \ literature was that they be review or survey papers. The latter is based on\n\
    the fact that this type of paper offers a general and consolidated overview of\
    \ the state-of-\nthe-art concerning CI-based FSC problems reported in the literature.\
    \ Moreover, these types\nof papers allowed us to know if any taxonomy was previously\
    \ proposed to classify the\nFSC problems.\nThe next stage in Figure 4 is search,\
    \ select, and review. Using the search set-up\nmentioned above, we identiﬁed the\
    \ survey and review papers introduced in the Motivation\nSection 2.3. Next, we\
    \ analyzed the FSC problems considered in these papers, the FSC stages\nwhere\
    \ the problems were located, and the families of CI methods usually considered\
    \ to\napproach these FSC problems.\nBased on the ﬁndings mentioned above, we moved\
    \ to the ﬁnal step of the methodology\nshown in Figure 4. The objective was to\
    \ design a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete FSC and the ﬁve families of\
    \ CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\nThis taxonomy also intends\
    \ to expand the previous classiﬁcation efforts by adding a\nnew categorization\
    \ attribute, indicating the type of FSC problem addressed from a CI\nperspective.\
    \ Thus, we characterized how the FSC problems identiﬁed in the previous\nstep\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. To do so, we considered the typologies\n\
    of problems in the CI domain (problem-solving, uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\n\
    knowledge discovery and function approximation, and communication and perception)\n\
    that better suited the families of CI methods considered in the studies reviewed.\n\
    Having built the taxonomy, we checked its robustness and ability to discriminate\n\
    papers that approached different FSC problems. To accomplish this aim, we extracted\n\
    relevant references cited by the review and survey papers previously identiﬁed,\
    \ as well as\nthe recent literature, and mapped them into the proposed taxonomy.\
    \ This is shown in the\nfollowing section, where the taxonomy is introduced, to\
    \ validate its classiﬁcation power.\n3.2. The Taxonomy Overview\nThe taxonomy\
    \ aims, ﬁrstly, to extend the previous classiﬁcation efforts on FSC prob-\nlems\
    \ to cover all stages of Agrifood supply chains; and, secondly, to add a new level\
    \ of\ncategorization that allows typologies of FSC problems to be mapped to typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems. We can see the structure of the proposed taxonomy in Figure\
    \ 5. As we can see,\nin level one, the taxonomy includes the four basic stages\
    \ of an FSC that were introduced in\nSection 2.2.1; that is, production, processing,\
    \ distribution, and retail. Then, in level two, it\ncontains the different categories\
    \ of FSC problems that we can ﬁnd in each stage. It is impor-\ntant to clarify\
    \ that although these FSC problems have been reported previously, in related\n\
    studies [2,6–12], to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that their\
    \ deﬁnitions are\nuniﬁed and consolidated in one taxonomy. Lastly, in level three,\
    \ the taxonomy introduces\nthe typologies of problems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ this level seeks to classify\nthe FSC problems depending on how they can be\
    \ modeled and solved by CI methods.\nHaving presented the structure of the taxonomy,\
    \ the following Section 3.3 details\nthe FSC problems identiﬁed for the production,\
    \ processing, distribution, and retail stages.\nThose problems represent the second\
    \ level of the taxonomy. They are formally deﬁned\nfrom a purely FSC perspective,\
    \ and we clearly state the key objective of each problem\nwithin the particular\
    \ chain stage where it is identiﬁed. Afterwards, Section 3.4 presents\nthe third\
    \ level of the taxonomy that contains the attributes to categorize the FSC problems\n\
    of level 2 under a CI approach. These attributes correspond to the four typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems that are more commonly used in the literature to address FSC\
    \ problems. Finally,\nSection 3.5 introduces the classiﬁcation and mapping of\
    \ FSC problems according to how\nthey can be modeled by CI typologies.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n13 of 34\nFigure 5. A taxonomy of computational intelligence\
    \ in an FSC.\n3.3. Level 2: Identiﬁcation and Deﬁnition of Food Supply Chain Problems\n\
    In this section, we present the FSC problems identiﬁed for each of the FSC stages\n\
    shown in Figure 5, which corresponds to the second level of our taxonomy. These\
    \ problems\nare formally deﬁned in more detail below.\n3.3.1. Production Problems\n\
    The FSC production stage can be split into three main production systems: ﬁsh\n\
    farming, agriculture, and livestock. These three production systems and their\
    \ associated\nproblems can be observed in Figure 6 and they are deﬁned below.\n\
    Figure 6. FSC problems in the production stage.\nFish farming (also known as pisciculture)\
    \ is the production system concerned with\nraising ﬁsh in closed environments,\
    \ such as ponds or tanks, for human consumption. Nowa-\ndays nearly half of the\
    \ ﬁsh consumed in the word are raised in artiﬁcial environments [57].\nFish farming\
    \ production has a high degree of complexity as it involves interrelated physical\n\
    (e.g., water and nutrient supply), chemical (e.g., pH, oxygen), and environmental\
    \ (e.g.,\nwaste generated) elements. Therefore, the management of this process\
    \ requires advanced\nsensing, control, and communication technologies as well\
    \ as expert knowledge to make\nefﬁcient and sustainable decisions, and maximize\
    \ the productivity. Within this context, the\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n14 of 34\n\
    most typical CI-based processes reported in the literature are ﬁsh weight estimation\
    \ [58],\nproduction estimation, and optimization [59]. Their deﬁnitions are presented\
    \ below.\n•\nFish weight estimation: This process estimates ﬁsh weight considering\
    \ morphological\nfeatures (e.g., length, width, and mass).\n•\nProduction estimation\
    \ and optimization: This process is centered on the optimiza-\ntion of ﬁsh production\
    \ and forecasting of seasonal demand to adjust the production.\nTo accomplish\
    \ such aims, the optimization of production is carried out by monitoring\ncrucial\
    \ elements of ﬁsh ponds, like water oxygen levels, nutrients, and food supply,\n\
    which inﬂuence the growth of ﬁsh. Meanwhile, historical records of seasonal de-\n\
    mand are stored and continuously analyzed to determine the most suitable levels\
    \ of\nproduction depending on the year and season.\nThe following production system\
    \ considered in this study is agriculture, in particular,\nhorticulture. Horticulture\
    \ is the greenhouse industry dedicated to plant cultivation and\nprocessing of\
    \ different types of crops for food and commercial consumption (e.g., ﬂowers,\n\
    fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs). The main challenges of these production\
    \ systems\nare to improve plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and\
    \ resistance to insects,\ndiseases, and environmental stress.\nIn order to achieve\
    \ these improvements, different processes are managed to try and\nmaintain a balance\
    \ between efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability, such as monitoring\nand\
    \ controlling indoor-outdoor climate conditions, crop management, and production\
    \ fore-\ncasting, among others. They are commonly approached in the specialized\
    \ literature [6,9,60]\nin open-ﬁeld agriculture and intensive horticulture. Within\
    \ the most representative pro-\ncesses, we ﬁnd the crop yield and harvest forecasting\
    \ [60–62], crop protection [63,64],\nweather prediction and irrigation management\
    \ [65,66], and site-speciﬁc nutrient manage-\nment [67,68]. These processes, which\
    \ are shown in Figure 6, are deﬁned as follows.\n•\nCrop yield and harvesting\
    \ prediction: This problem is focused on yield estimation\nto match crop supply\
    \ with demand and on crop management to increase productivity.\n•\nCrop protection:\
    \ This is based on the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of biotic (infesta-\ntions,\
    \ diseases, and weeds) and abiotic (nutrients, water deﬁciency) stress factors\
    \ that\naffect crop productivity.\n•\nWeather prediction and irrigation management:\
    \ This problem is mainly concerned\nwith weather forecasting for the optimal use\
    \ of water, which enables the design and\ndeployment of crop irrigation scheduling\
    \ and planning.\n•\nSite-speciﬁc nutrient management: This is based on the management\
    \ of soil quality\nto determine which nutrients need to be supplied in order to\
    \ maintain the chemical\ncharacteristics required for the crop under consideration.\n\
    Lastly, the third production system considered for the production stage is livestock.\n\
    This production system is dedicated to the growth and management of domestic animals\n\
    (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) raised in agricultural settings to generate food\
    \ products like\nmeat, eggs, or milk, among others. Livestock can be carried out\
    \ through either extensive or\nintensive systems. Extensive systems involve animals\
    \ roaming grasslands (usually under\nthe supervision of a herdsman). Diversely,\
    \ intensive livestock is located in closed infras-\ntructures and is equipped\
    \ with ICT technology, which enables animals to be monitored\nin real-time. Within\
    \ these production systems the most typical problems we come across\nare grassland\
    \ monitoring [69], animal welfare [70], animal behavior tracking [71], and\nlivestock\
    \ production prediction and optimization [72,73], as shown in Figure 6. The formal\n\
    deﬁnitions of these problems from an FSC perspective are listed below.\n•\nGrassland\
    \ monitoring: This problem is related to the accurate identiﬁcation of grass-\n\
    land inventories in order to discriminate between the most suitable types for\
    \ live-\nstock purposes.\n•\nAnimal welfare: This is focused on the pattern classiﬁcation\
    \ of ingestive behavior in\ngrazing animals for studies of animal nutrition, growth,\
    \ and health.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n15 of 34\n•\nAnimal behavior tracking:\
    \ This is based on the use of behavior analysis to detect\nearly signs of health\
    \ issues and promote early intervention.\n•\nLivestock production: This problem\
    \ is centered on predictions and estimations of\nfarming parameters to optimize\
    \ the economic-energy efﬁciency and sustainability of\nproduction systems.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Processing Problems\nOnce the raw materials of food products have been grown,\
    \ they are delivered to the\nnext step of the FSC, or ‘processing’. Different\
    \ industrial processes (e.g., washing, disinfect-\ning, packaging) are carried\
    \ out in this stage to transform the raw output of production into\nedible food\
    \ products. Depending on the production system under consideration and the\nfood\
    \ products obtained from them, diverse industrial processes can be followed to\
    \ obtain\nthe goods that move on to the distribution stage. However, in spite\
    \ of such production\nparticularities, we have identiﬁed a set of common problems\
    \ that could occur in the three\nproduction systems presented in the section above.\
    \ These problems are shown in Figure 7\nand they are: demand prediction [74],\
    \ production planning for distribution [75], prediction\nof post-harvest losses\
    \ [76], and manufacturing industry processes, such as cooking, drying,\nand others\
    \ [77].\nFigure 7. FSC problems in the processing stage.\n•\nDemand prediction:\
    \ This problem in concerneed with the demand prediction of food\nrequirements\
    \ to avoid overstocking, overproduction, and over-utilization of resources.\n\
    The key idea is to estimate the quantity of food products that will be sold to\
    \ deﬁne\nhow much raw material needs to be processed.\n•\nProduction planning\
    \ for distribution: This is centered on production planning to\nmatch distribution\
    \ requirements. This problem is mostly determined by the sale\nvolumes that a\
    \ particular food product is expected to have.\n•\nPrediction of post-harvest\
    \ losses: This is focused on making estimations of food\nlosses associated with\
    \ the processing procedures carried out after harvesting raw\nmaterials coming\
    \ from the production stage.\n•\nFood manufacturing industry: This is associated\
    \ with the optimization of the pro-\ncessing technologies required to transform\
    \ raw foods into edible food (e.g., thermal,\ndrying, contact cooking, microwave\
    \ heating, etc.). These processes are performed\nusing industrial machinery.\n\
    3.3.3. Distribution Problems\nIn the third step of the food supply chain, food\
    \ products ready for human consumption\nare received from the processing stage\
    \ to be delivered to end-consumers. Speciﬁcally,\nﬁnished products arrive at warehouses,\
    \ and from there, the shipment department is\nin charge of deﬁning the most suitable\
    \ strategy to deliver products to end-consumers.\nThe essential purpose is to\
    \ distribute food products on time by the date speciﬁed in the\nretail stage.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n16 of 34\nFor this particular stage of the FSC, the most\
    \ common problems reported in the spe-\ncialized literature are shown in Figure\
    \ 8 and deﬁned below. These problems include vehicle\nrouting and ﬂeet management\
    \ [78,79], storage location assignment [80,81], prediction of\nsupply chain risks\
    \ and disruptions [82,83], shelf life prediction and maturity level [84–86],\n\
    demand forecasting [87], and last mile delivery [88].\nFigure 8. FSC problems\
    \ in the distribution stage.\n•\nVehicle routing and ﬂeet management: This is\
    \ focused on determining the most\noptimal route for the delivery of food under\
    \ different scenario constraints (e.g., size of\nthe ﬂeet, fuel availability,\
    \ etc.).\n•\nStorage location assignment problem: This problem is concerned with\
    \ deciding the\nmost suitable way to store food products in a set of warehouses\
    \ in order to cope with\ndaily demand operations.\n•\nPrediction of supply chain\
    \ risks and disruptions: This is concerned with the fore-\ncasting of potential\
    \ disruptions in the logistics of food products and their associated\nfood losses.\n\
    •\nShelf life prediction and maturity level: This problem is related to the forecasting\
    \ of\nshelf life based on data sensed during the distribution process.\n•\nDemand\
    \ forecasting: This consists of understanding demand behaviors and forecast-\n\
    ing user demand generated from the retail stage. Thus, it is possible to optimize\
    \ the\ndelivery routes and warehouse locations used during the distribution stage.\n\
    •\nLast mile delivery: This problem is dedicated to the delivery of food products\
    \ using\nthe local road transport network (last mile) of cities.\n3.3.4. Retail\
    \ Problems\nIn the ﬁnal part of the FSC, we ﬁnd the retail stage. At this point,\
    \ food products are\nreceived through the distribution channels, ready for sale.\
    \ This stage encompasses the\nconcept of an ’end-consumer’, which could be supermarkets\
    \ or clients that go to these\nplaces to buy food products. The most common problems\
    \ identiﬁed in the literature for\nthis stage of the supply chain are deﬁned below\
    \ and are also summarized in Figure 9.\nLastly, we characterized the retail stage\
    \ (Figure 5). Retail-related problems commonly\naddressed with CI, in this link\
    \ of the FSC, are diet and nutrition applications [89,90],\nfood consumption and\
    \ food waste [91,92], consumer demand, perception and buying\nbehavior [93,94],\
    \ dynamic discounting based on the sell-by date [95], and day demand\nprediction\
    \ and inventory management [74].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n17 of 34\nFigure 9.\
    \ FSC problems in the retail stage.\n•\nDiet and Nutrition: This is based on estimating\
    \ nutrient values using the classiﬁcation\nof food dishes and dietary assessment.\n\
    •\nFood consumption and food waste: This problem is associated with the identification\n\
    and prediction of food waste based on the buying and storage behavior of end-customers.\n\
    •\nConsumer demand, perception, and buying behavior: This problem is focused on\n\
    determining consumer proﬁles in order to predict buying behaviors and support\
    \ the\nmanagement of shop counters.\n•\nDynamic discounting based on sell-by date:\
    \ This is centered on automated price\nchanges at supermarkets based on the sell-by\
    \ date. The objective is to offer larger\ndiscounts for items with the shortest\
    \ remaining shelf life.\n•\nDaily demand prediction and inventory management:\
    \ This problem consists of\npredicting daily demand to better manage product stocks\
    \ at supermarkets.\n3.4. Level 3: Typologies of CI Problems\nIn this section,\
    \ we introduce the attributes that represent the most typical typologies\nof CI\
    \ modeling approaches used in the FSC literature. The attributes correspond to\
    \ the\nthird level of the taxonomy shown in Figure 5, and they are presented below.\n\
    •\nProblem-solving: This category is related to problems of complex decision-making\n\
    processes that need to be solved, keeping two key objectives in mind: quality\
    \ of the\nsolution and the computational time required to solve it. As a common\
    \ denominator,\nthis attribute categorizes problems that are NP-hard. Thus, this\
    \ class embodies FSC\nproblems for which there is no certainty that the method\
    \ can optimally solve them\nin a polynomial time (time complexity [96]) with respect\
    \ to the input data size. This\ncategory includes, for example, optimization or\
    \ search problems such as the vehicle\nrouting problem in the transportation stage\
    \ of the FSC.\n•\nUncertain knowledge and reasoning: This category corresponds\
    \ to FSC problems\ncharacterized by having partially observable, non-deterministic,\
    \ vague, or imprecise\ndata. In such uncertain scenarios, this attribute represents\
    \ problems that can be\naddressed in two possible ways. First, by using an approach\
    \ that acts based on\nassumptions of uncertain input data in order to give a probabilistic-based\
    \ solution\nto the problem at hand. Or second, by representing and reasoning with\
    \ the partially\navailable information in a manner similar to the way that humans\
    \ express knowledge\nand summarize data. This second approach allows non-exact\
    \ data to be represented\nin linguist terms in order to make decisions within\
    \ certain margins of correctness.\n•\nKnowledge discovery and function approximation:\
    \ This class represents FSC prob-\nlems that are distinguished by having large\
    \ volumes of data, which enable under-\nstanding and useful knowledge to be extracted\
    \ from them. Such knowledge could be\nused to make either predictions of future\
    \ events or discrimination and recognition of\npatterns. These types of problems\
    \ can usually be addressed with methods that can be\ntrained using the available\
    \ data to learn a speciﬁc task.\n•\nCommunication and perception: This category\
    \ consists of FSC problems focused\non the automatic extraction, analysis, and\
    \ understanding of information obtained\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n18 of 34\nfrom\
    \ digital images, texts, or voice recordings. It is worth noting that within the\
    \ FSC\ndomain, most problems solved using a communication and perception approach\
    \ are\nfocused on designing and developing autonomous computer vision systems.\
    \ These\nsystems are able to process high-dimensional data to support decision-making;\
    \ from\nobject detection to video tracking and object recognition.\n3.5. Mapping\
    \ Process between Level 2 and Level 3: Classiﬁcation of FSC Problems from a\n\
    CI Perspective\nThis section presents the categorization of FSC problems previously\
    \ identiﬁed in\nSection 3.3 from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, every problem\
    \ is categorized according\nto the four typologies of CI problems that we described\
    \ above: problem-solving, uncer-\ntain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation, and\ncommunication and perception. In addition,\
    \ using relevant work from the recent FSC\nliterature, we show how the taxonomy\
    \ is able to effectively and robustly discriminate these\npapers. Thus, Section\
    \ 3.5.1 is devoted to classifying the FSC problems coming from the\nproduction\
    \ stage. Then, Section 3.5.2 introduces the classiﬁcation of problems deﬁned for\n\
    the processing stage. Lastly, Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 expose the categorization\
    \ of problems\nfor the distribution and retail phases, respectively.\n3.5.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Production Problems\nFigure 10 presents the categorization of production\
    \ problems for the ﬁsh farming\nand livestock cases. The attributes of the taxonomy\
    \ are depicted on the left in Figure 10,\nwhereas the ﬁsh farming (in purple)\
    \ and livestock (in red) problems are found on the right.\nThe problems and attributes\
    \ are connected by gray bars that connect the ways in which a\nspeciﬁc problem\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. Fish weight estimation, grassland\nmonitoring,\
    \ animal welfare, and animal behavior tracking are problems that are classiﬁed\n\
    using the communication and perception attribute. This is justiﬁed due to the\
    \ fact that\nthese problems are usually characterized by having image and video\
    \ records as input\ndata (non-structured data). Having such data implies the use\
    \ of automatic information\nextraction by means of computer vision systems, based\
    \ on DL, which allow extraction of\nhigh-dimensional patterns embedded in image\
    \ and video data [97–103].\nFigure 10. Fish farming and livestock problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\nThe production estimation and optimization and livestock\
    \ production problems in\nFigure 10 are classiﬁed using the knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation and\nuncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes.\
    \ Such categorization is determined by the\ncentral characteristics of these problems,\
    \ which are concerned with the prediction and\noptimization of production values\
    \ using historical data records (structured data) [104,105].\nBesides, production\
    \ forecasting contains uncertainties regarding external factors of the\nproduction\
    \ systems, which encourage the use of probabilistic methods, such as the studies\n\
    carried out by [106,107].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n19 of 34\nFigure 11 shows the\
    \ categorization of agriculture problems. As we can seen, crop\nprotection, which\
    \ usually involves video and image records, is categorized as a com-\nmunication\
    \ and perception problem commonly used in DL methods like convolutional\nand recurrent\
    \ neural networks [108–110]. On the other hand, the remaining agricultural\nproblems\
    \ can be categorized under knowledge discovery and function approximation,\nproblem-solving,\
    \ and uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes as explained below.\nIn terms\
    \ of knowledge discovery and function approximation, this attribute categorizes\n\
    problems focused on the prediction of greenhouse conditions for the optimal management\n\
    of crop production, nutrients, and irrigation supply. This can be done using supervised\n\
    learning techniques that forecast variables of interest like temperature, water,\
    \ or nitro-\ngen [6,111]. Secondly, the problem-solving attribute categorizes\
    \ the weather prediction and\nirrigation management and the site-speciﬁc management\
    \ problems. These problems can be\ndeﬁned as optimization scenarios in which we\
    \ can ﬁnd concrete values associated with\nweather, irrigation, and nutrients.\
    \ In this case, the most common approach to solving them\nis based on meta-heuristics\
    \ [112–114].\nFinally, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes characterize\
    \ the same prob-\nlems that fall into the knowledge discovery and function approximation\
    \ attribute. The\ndifference lies in the fact that the agriculture problems are\
    \ approached as decision systems\nunder uncertainty. In this case, fuzzy logic\
    \ is the most suitable strategy to accomplish such\nan aim [115–117] Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the fuzzy approach allows us to evaluate whether particular\nactions need to\
    \ be taken according to sensed and predicted conditions coming from agri-\nculture\
    \ systems (e.g., optimal management strategies for the control of temperature\
    \ control\ninside greenhouse systems).\nFigure 11. Agriculture problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.2. Classiﬁcation of Processing Problems\nHaving\
    \ presented the production stage, Figure 12 features the categorization of prob-\n\
    lems in the processing stage. Any of the depicted FSC problems are classiﬁed using\
    \ the\ncommunication and perception attribute, mainly because the type of input\
    \ data they handle\nis not associated with images or video records. In contrast,\
    \ when the aim is to determine\nfuture scenarios based on the available data,\
    \ all problems tend to have historical data as\ntheir input data.\nPrecisely,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute categorizes\nthe\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses and demand prediction problems as being super-\n\
    vised learning problems, whose aims are to claasify and forecast the objective\
    \ variable.\nFor instance, we consider research from [8,118] to be within this\
    \ category. Following the\ntaxonomy’s attributes in Figure 12, the problem-solving\
    \ attribute can represent and model\ndemand predictions, the food manufacturing\
    \ industry, and production planning for dis-\ntribution problems. In this scenario,\
    \ they are classiﬁed as being optimization problems,\nwith the objective of optimizing\
    \ procedures related to the problems listed. An example, for\ninstance, could\
    \ be the optimization of industrial manufacturing processes, like heating and\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n20 of 34\ndrying, using meta-heuristic techniques. Examples\
    \ of studies categorized by the taxonomy\nof the previously mentioned approaches\
    \ are found in [119,120].\nLastly, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attribute\
    \ system also classiﬁes produc-\ntion planning for distribution problems. Probabilistic\
    \ methods tend to be used to approach\nthese kind of problems as production planning\
    \ can incorporate uncertainty coming from\nprocesses that are not directly related\
    \ to the production process, which can cope with\nprobability theory [121]. An\
    \ example of this last situation could be a change in the delivery\ndate due to\
    \ delays attributable to the weather [122].\nFigure 12. Processing problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.3. Classiﬁcation of Distribution Problems\nFigure\
    \ 13 exhibits the classiﬁcation of FSC problems in the distribution stage. Unlike\n\
    the two previous stages (production and processing), the predominant approaches\
    \ here are\nthe ones imposed by the problem-solving and knowledge discovery and\
    \ function approxi-\nmation attributes. The former attribute categorizes vehicle\
    \ routing and ﬂeet management,\nthe storage location assignment problem, and last\
    \ mile delivery problems, as they are\ndevoted to optimizing routing and delivery\
    \ situations. The purpose of these applications\nis to optimize, using meta-heuristics,\
    \ a concrete goal under different constraints; for in-\nstance, ﬂeet size, available\
    \ fuel, and others. Representative studies that fall in this category\nare [123–127].\n\
    The knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes prediction\n\
    of chain and disruptions, a shelf life prediction and maturity level, and demand\
    \ forecasting\nproblems. This attribute classiﬁes these problems under a supervised\
    \ learning perspective,\nwhere the aim is to predict expected values, such as\
    \ we can see in research carried out\nin [84,128–131]. For instance, potential\
    \ disruptions to the cold food products chain, or an\nestimation of how much product\
    \ volume needs to be distributed to meet retail demands.\nFigure 13. Distribution\
    \ problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.4. Classiﬁcation of Retail\
    \ Problems\nFinally, Figure 14 introduces the classification of problems in the\
    \ retail stage of\nthe FSC. In this last step, the communication and perception\
    \ attribute appears once\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n21 of 34\nagain to represent\
    \ the problems in which the input data correspond to non-structured\ndata, such\
    \ as images (dynamic discounting, daily demand prediction, and inventory\nmanagement)\
    \ [95,132–135]. For these particular cases, the problems can be modeled using\n\
    DL techniques to determining price discounts based on stock levels inside supermarkets\n\
    and by managing inventories according to food product existence.\nContrarily,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes\nproblems\
    \ associated with the extraction of patterns (food consumption and food waste),\n\
    the prediction of future values related to consumer demand and buying behavior,\
    \ and the\ngeneration of healthy menus or estimating nutritional values. Research\
    \ articles on this\nattribute include [89,90,136–139]. Furthermore, this attribute\
    \ can also classify the dynamic\ndiscounting and daily demand prediction and inventory\
    \ management problems when\ntheir input data corresponds to structured information\
    \ like historical records.\nIn addition to the attributes mentioned above, the\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nand problem-solving attributes can be used\
    \ to categorize a couple of problems in the retail\nstage. Those problems are\
    \ consumer demand, perception, and buying behavior, as well\nas daily demand prediction\
    \ and inventory management. Consumer demand, perception,\nand buying behavior\
    \ can be approached with a probabilistic system [140–142], for instance,\nuncertainty\
    \ concerning what food products are expected to be bought. Meanwhile, daily\n\
    demand prediction and inventory management can be addressed with an optimization\n\
    paradigm [143,144]. For this case, the aim is to optimize stock levels in such\
    \ a way that\nfood waste can be decreased or even to avoiding over-stocking issues\
    \ completely.\nFigure 14. Retail problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n\
    4. Guidelines for the Use of Computational Intelligence Approaches in the Food\n\
    Supply Chain\nHaving presented and validated the taxonomy of FSC problems, this\
    \ section presents\na set of guidelines for researchers and practitioners in FSC\
    \ for the use of CI within this\ndomain (Figure 15). Concretely, we try to guide\
    \ the users to (1) select the typology of a\nCI problem that they are addressing;\
    \ and (2) identify what families of CI methods could\nbe more suitable for the\
    \ problem at hand. The latter does not mean that in all cases the\nfamily of methods\
    \ suggested is the most appropriate, as this may depend on the speciﬁc\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the problem being addressed.\nThe guidelines depicted in Figure 15 start\
    \ with a basic question posed to the user:\n“What is the purpose and modeling\
    \ characteristics of the problem at hand?” (it could be\ncommunication and perception,\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving). If the purpose is the automatic analysis\nand extraction\
    \ of information from digital images to decide on the action to be taken\nregarding\
    \ the management of food supply systems (communication and perception), the\n\
    suitable family of methods would be deep neural networks (e.g., convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks). This family of CI methods enables the creation of computer\
    \ vision systems,\nwhich allows the environment of object characteristics to be\
    \ perceived in a visual way.\nBased on this visual analysis, these systems communicate\
    \ or recommend actions that\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n22 of 34\nachieve desired\
    \ states or match predeﬁned conditions (e.g., identify the quality of potatoes\n\
    in order to evaluate the units that are either damaged or edible).\nFigure 15.\
    \ Guidelines for the method selection problem in the food supply chain. Pd: production,\
    \ Ps:\nprocessing, D: distribution, R: retail.\nIf the objective of the user is\
    \ to handle problems characterized by partially observable,\nnon-deterministic,\
    \ or imprecise data (uncertain knowledge and reasoning), fuzzy systems\nor probabilistic\
    \ methods are recommended. For the former CI approach, it is important\nto highlight\
    \ that fuzzy systems need to be paired with hardware (e.g., PID controllers)\n\
    to work properly in food applications. This is due to the fact that hardware components\n\
    allow decisions made by fuzzy systems to be translated into actions (e.g., management\n\
    of nutrients and irrigation supply inside a greenhouse system depending on conditions\n\
    associated with temperature). Probabilistic methods are suitable for making estimations\
    \ of\nrelevant variables (e.g., planning production according to seasonal demand)\
    \ in scenarios\nwith partially observable data.\nWhen the users’ aim is directed\
    \ at making predictions from historical data, making\nclassiﬁcations that discriminate\
    \ between data categories, or ﬁnding hidden patterns in data,\nthe best modeling\
    \ approach to use is knowledge discovery and function approximation.\nFirstly,\
    \ for predictions and classiﬁcations, the user should determine the type of input\n\
    data at hand. In general terms, the input data can be structured (e.g., historical\
    \ records,\ntabular data) or unstructured (e.g., video, images). In the former,\
    \ and depending on the\ndata size, the supervised learning techniques are the\
    \ CI methods to be used when facing\nsmall, medium, and large data no bigger than\
    \ 40–50 gigabytes. Supervised DL, how-\never, is the recommended approach for\
    \ big datasets. In terms of making predictions and\nclassiﬁcations when using\
    \ unstructured data, supervised DL would be the most suitable\nlearning approach;\
    \ while unsupervised ML or unsupervised DL are the recommended\nCI approaches\
    \ for pattern analysis. Finally, as we can see in Figure 15, the other category\n\
    of problems that users might face is problem-solving. In this case, the user’s\
    \ aim is to\noptimize particular values in order to achieve a desired level of\
    \ performance. As such,\nthe above-suggested approaches are therefore all meta-heuristics\
    \ (e.g., EC, SI, and local\nsearch-based techniques).\nIn addition to the analyses\
    \ presented above, the bottom part of Figure 15 also depicts\nwhich FSC stages\
    \ the four CI modeling approaches (and their associated methods) are\nusually\
    \ applied in. Fuzzy systems and probabilistic approaches are typically considered\
    \ for\ncontrol applications in the production, processing, and retail stages.\
    \ In contrast, optimiza-\ntion with meta-heuristics and prediction-classiﬁcation-pattern\
    \ analysis with ML and DL\nare modeling perspectives that are considered in the\
    \ entire FSC process. The contributions\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n23 of 34\nof\
    \ communication and perception approaches using DL methods tend to be more typically\n\
    focused on the production and retail stages.\n5. Conclusions\nThis ﬁnal section\
    \ introduces the main reﬂections drawn from the research carried out\nin this\
    \ paper. Section 5.1 introduces the summary and conclusions. Then, Section 5.2\
    \ details\na set of challenges and research opportunities to encourage further\
    \ exploration and use of\nthe possible contributions that CI might bring to the\
    \ FSC ﬁeld.\n5.1. Summary\nThis paper has proposed a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\nunder a CI paradigm for three representative supply chains:\
    \ agriculture, ﬁsh farming,\nand livestock. The taxonomy was built based on three\
    \ levels in order to categorize FSC\nproblems according to how they can be modeled\
    \ using CI approaches. The ﬁrst and second\nlevels are focused on identifying\
    \ the chain stage (production, processing, distribution,\nand retail) and the\
    \ speciﬁc FSC problem to be addressed (e.g., vehicle routing problems\nin the\
    \ distribution stage). The third level presents the typologies of FSC problems\
    \ from\na CI perspective, and aims to categorize FSC problems depending on how\
    \ they can be\nmodeled and solved by CI methods. In the third level of the taxonomy\
    \ we have deﬁned\nfour attributes, presented as follows, (1) problem solving,\
    \ which is in charge of classifying\nFSC problems focused on optimizing processes;\
    \ (2) uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nwhich concers problems that have partially\
    \ observable, non-deterministic, incomplete, or\nimprecise data; (3) knowledge\
    \ discovery and function approximation, which has the role\nof categorizing problems\
    \ that aim to make predictions of future scenarios, classiﬁcation of\nvariables,\
    \ or analysis of patterns embedded in data; (4) communication and perception,\n\
    groups FSC problems that involve computer vision systems to sensing and suggesting\n\
    plausible actions to take in order to intervene in such environments.\nTo check\
    \ the robustness of the taxonomy, we categorized FSC problems with CI\nmethods,\
    \ especially in the production, processing, distribution, and retail stages. Here,\
    \ it is\nrelevant to highlight that we introduced a set of uniﬁed deﬁnitions for\
    \ these problems. As\na result, we were able to draw some interesting conclusions.\
    \ In the ﬁsh and livestock cases\nof the production stage, using the DL and the\
    \ communication and perception attribute\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuences applications\
    \ (e.g., ﬁsh weight estimation, grassland monitoring,\nanimal welfare) where the\
    \ input data is determined by image and video records (non-\nstructured data).\
    \ In contrast, we have the case of classic ML, which is narrowed to FSC\nproblems,\
    \ and for which, the objective is to make production predictions using historical\n\
    data records (structured data). In the case of agriculture production systems,\
    \ the scope of\nthe CI approach is broader. Speciﬁcally, we found that DL, ML,\
    \ FL, and Meta-heuristics are\nmethods for modeling production problems related\
    \ to crop protection and yield, weather\nprediction, and irrigation and nutrient\
    \ management.\nIn the processing stage, ML, meta-heuristics, and probabilistic\
    \ methods are the CI\napproaches commonly used. In terms of ML, the aim is to\
    \ extract patterns and forecast\nobjective variables like demand prediction and\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses. As for\nmeta-heuristics and probabilistic\
    \ techniques, they aim to optimize food manufacturing\nprocesses (e.g., heating,\
    \ drying) and production planning for distribution. Further down\nin the supply\
    \ chain, the predominant family of CI methods is meta-heuristics, found in\nthe\
    \ distribution link. This data-driven approach is devoted to optimizing the routing\n\
    and delivery problems under various constraints such as ﬂeet size and available\
    \ fuel.\nLastly, DL is the principal CI approach in problems with non-structured\
    \ input data (e.g.,\ndynamic discounting, diet, and nutrition) in the retail stage.\
    \ Classical ML has been used to\nextract patterns (food consumption and food waste)\
    \ and predict consumer demand and\nbuying behavior.\nThe taxonomy allowed us to\
    \ ﬁgure out which modeling approaches are more typically\nconsidered when dealing\
    \ with problems at the four supply chain stages. In this manner,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 6910\n24 of 34\nwe gave a general overview of well-established tendencies\
    \ regarding CI across the three\nsupply chains considered. Thus, the deﬁnition\
    \ and classiﬁcation of FSC problems helped\nus introduce guidelines for the incorporation\
    \ and use of CI in the food industry. These\nguidelines are built upon CI’s primary\
    \ purposes in the food supply chain: communication\nand perception, uncertain\
    \ knowledge and reasoning representations, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving. These guidelines aim to help non-expert\nCI users to identify\
    \ families of methods that can supply a solution for their particular CI-\nbased\
    \ needs in different FSC problems.\nIn summary, the taxonomy analysis suggests\
    \ that there is no family of CI methods\nthat best suits all FSC problems. However,\
    \ we state the need for a comparison framework\nthat allows the description and\
    \ analysis of the performance of different CI methods in\ndiverse supply chain\
    \ problems. In this context, the taxonomy presented sets up the basis\nfor a common\
    \ framework that, in further research, will facilitate experimentation in order\n\
    to determine which CI approaches are more appropriate for each type of FSC problem.\n\
    This may also help determine a suitable baseline of methods to make fair comparisons,\n\
    depending on the family of CI methods chosen for the FSC problem at hand.\n5.2.\
    \ Challenges and Research Opportunities\nAs industry 4.0 is ﬂourishing for the\
    \ FSC management and operation, emerging re-\nsearch paths arise for CI to yield\
    \ more robust, interoperable, and accurate methods [145,146].\nTherefore, this\
    \ section points out challenges and research opportunities that the community\n\
    should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nThese challenges are motivated by the gaps located at the intersection\
    \ of FSC and CI, which\nwere identiﬁed through the proposed taxonomy.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Data Fusion from Different Data Sources\nSigniﬁcantly, few CI methods can incorporate\
    \ data from different types of sources.\nBesides, in real scenarios, the data\
    \ available from a unique type of sensor might not be\nsufﬁcient to fully represent\
    \ the FSC problem that is intended to be addressed. For instance,\ndifferent Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., agricultural environment monitoring sys-\ntems,\
    \ GPS, cameras) provide diverse data for the optimum management of production\n\
    systems [147–149]. Amongst the relevant data for the aforementioned example, we\
    \ ﬁnd\ntemperature, humidity, localization coordinates, crop images, and others.\n\
    As a common denominator, all the data associated with the aforementioned variables\n\
    can have a different format, ranging from historical records in the form of tables,\
    \ to non-\nstructured data like images. Additionally, all of them offer valuable\
    \ information for the\npurpose at hand (e.g., prediction of crop production or\
    \ management of pest diseases). In\nthis context, the challenge lies in deﬁning\
    \ guidelines for the harmonizing and fusion of\ndata from diverse sources. Such\
    \ guidelines should consider that each FSC stage can add\nparticularities to the\
    \ data for the CI-based problem under consideration. How to properly\ncollect\
    \ and generate a single dataset with information obtained from varied and different\n\
    sources, which are fed into a CI method, is a research opportunity that must be\
    \ addressed\nto further enhance CI contributions in the FSC domain.\nIf the integration\
    \ process is not done correctly, inconsistencies will appear, resulting in\na\
    \ decrease in the performance of CI approaches [150]. Hence, merging data from\
    \ different\ninput sources presents a notorious problem that commonly attracts\
    \ more issues, such as\ninconsistent, duplicate, redundant, and correlated data.\
    \ One potential research direction\nto take to help cope with this challenge could\
    \ be designing automatic preprocessing\napproaches that fuse and harmonize data\
    \ sources to provide the accepted input format\nof CI methods. For the latter,\
    \ it is important to note that every CI approach requires\ndifferent input data\
    \ formats, which could split the design of the aforementioned automatic\ndata\
    \ preprocessing methods into diverse paths depending on the particular family\
    \ of CI\nmethods under consideration.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n25 of 34\n5.2.2.\
    \ Real-Time Data and Incremental Learning\nIn supervised learning, the input data\
    \ is available before starting any training pro-\ncesses. Here, the task is to\
    \ build up a model from that data using a batch approach. The\nlatter means that\
    \ DL and ML methods use all available samples in the input data to build\nand\
    \ train a model to make predictions or classiﬁcations when new data comes into\
    \ the\ntrained model. Currently, most DL and ML applications are focused on the\
    \ batch learning\napproach, wherein data are given before training the ML models\
    \ [151]. In this context,\nmodel training and optimization processes are purely\
    \ based on the aforementioned in-\nput dataset, whose data distribution is supposed\
    \ to be static. Nevertheless, such a static\napproach is not the case for real\
    \ CI-based applications within the FSC.\nDL and ML methods must real FSC scenarios,\
    \ wherein different IoT devices continu-\nously generate new data streams. For\
    \ instance, dynamic discounts in the retail stage or the\nmanagement of greenhouse\
    \ systems whose conditions must be constantly monitored to\nguarantee the optimal\
    \ control of crops are examples of real-time data streams. Therefore,\nthe key\
    \ challenge is to design ML and DL methods that adapt to real-time data, and work\n\
    with limited resources (e.g., memory), while maintaining their predictive capacities.\n\
    Further research is needed to deal with the aforementioned challenge, and should\n\
    include the concepts of incremental learning [152,153] in the design and deployment\
    \ of\nDL and ML methods in FSC problems. Furthermore, although incremental learning\
    \ is a\nsuitable strategy when dealing with the adaptation of DL and ML to real-time\
    \ data streams,\nthe concept of incremental learning brings up other issues that\
    \ must be considered when it\nis included in the FSC context. These issues are\
    \ introduced in more detail below.\nThe ﬁrst issue is related to the concept of\
    \ drift, which is associated with changes in\nthe new input data’s statistical\
    \ properties (e.g., statistical distribution), which can highly\ninﬂuence the\
    \ performance of pre-trained DL or ML methods [154]. Secondly, we have\nthe stability-plasticity\
    \ dilemma that, in noisy environments, refers to when and how to\nadapt the current\
    \ model to the new data stream [155]. On the one hand, quick updates\nenable fast\
    \ adaptations of the model according to new data; however, at the same time, old\n\
    information that could be useful later in the process is forgotten just as quickly.\
    \ On the\nother hand, slow adaptations can be made, and old data is retained longer,\
    \ causing the\nmodel’s reactivity capacity to decrease; thereby, affecting the\
    \ model’s forecasting power.\nThus, deﬁning policies to balance the two scenarios\
    \ mentioned above is a relevant challenge\nto support the inclusion of CI approaches\
    \ in real-time data environments.\nFinally, the third challenge associated with\
    \ incremental learning is adaptive model\ncomplexity [156]. This issue is concerned\
    \ with the fact that as concept drift events become\nmore frequent, increasing\
    \ model complexity is required. Although the latter improves the\nmodel’s performance,\
    \ increasing its complexity leads to an increase in the need of more\ncomputational\
    \ resources, which are not always affordable or available in different domains,\n\
    such as FSC.\n5.2.3. Explainability of Computational Intelligence Methods\nNowadays,\
    \ CI systems have increased their capacity to carry out different tasks (e.g.,\n\
    predictions, classiﬁcation) with almost no human intervention and are achieving\
    \ high\nproﬁciency levels. In a narrow scope, if the only objective when evaluating\
    \ CI methods is\nperformance, such an object has clearly been achieved thanks\
    \ to this increasing capacity.\nNonetheless, when decisions derived from CI-based\
    \ techniques affect the dynamics of hu-\nman life (e.g., social, cultural, environmental\
    \ dimensions), understanding how CI systems\nhave achieved this performance becomes\
    \ necessary [157].\nWhile some CI approaches, such as fuzzy logic and ML methods\
    \ (e.g., rule-based\nlearners, decision trees), can provide different degrees\
    \ of interpretability and transparency\nof decisions made in their inner structure;\
    \ other methods cannot provide this information\n(e.g., black-box decision systems\
    \ [158]). In these cases, there are no clues regarding the\nsystems’ decisions\
    \ to obtain the ﬁnal result. One example is DL methods, whose complex\ninner structure\
    \ is full of intricate connections between layers and neurons and have a broad\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n26 of 34\nspace of hyperparameters. Therefore, understanding\
    \ where the high performance of DL\nmethods comes from is quite tricky.\nAs DL\
    \ is increasingly being employed in diverse FSC applications due to its per-\n\
    formance capacities, the demand for interpretability, explainability, and transparency\
    \ is\ngrowing between diverse FSC stakeholders. Such demand lies in the fact that\
    \ decisions\nmade based on CI systems can lead to actions, which can not be justiﬁed\
    \ or that require\ndetailed explanations [159] in order to enhance the management\
    \ of the supply chain. For\nexample, the shelf-life of perishable products needs\
    \ to be predicted in the distribution\nstage. However, understanding the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence the deterioration or preservation\nof food products is vital to\
    \ improve the management of distribution chains. The latter is\nknown as explainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI) and is widely acknowledged as a crucial\nconcept\
    \ to be taken into account in the practical deployment of CI methods [160].\n\
    In this sense, as stated by [160], the challenge of XAI in different knowledge\
    \ domains,\nsuch as FSCs, is creating more explainable methods while maintaining\
    \ their output perfor-\nmance. Besides, it is crucial to facilitate stakeholder\
    \ understanding and trust in decisions\nsupported by CI systems whose outputs\
    \ become the basis for different actions along the\nwhole supply chain.\n5.2.4.\
    \ The Method Selection Problem\nAs shown in this research paper, depending on\
    \ the FSC problem at hand, different\ntypes of CI methods could be used. In this\
    \ sense, Section 4 provides helpful information\nto guide non-expert CI users\
    \ when choosing the most suitable CI family of methods\ndepending on the purpose\
    \ to be pursued (e.g., prediction, classiﬁcation, optimization). In\nthis context,\
    \ keeping in mind the no-free-lunch theorem [161] (which states that there is\n\
    no unique algorithm that can be competitive in all problems), the proposed guidelines\n\
    contribute to dealing with the model selection problem in the FSC area. Nevertheless,\n\
    having identiﬁed the most suitable families of CI methods, it is still difﬁcult\
    \ to choose the\nbest method within each family.\nFor instance, if the objective\
    \ is to optimize a food production process in the processing\nstage, the critical\
    \ question would be to ask what meta-heuristic approach is the most\nsuitable\
    \ for the considered problem. The answer to this question could be to use an\n\
    EC, SI, or local-based approach. However, solving such a decision requires a thorough\n\
    experimentation that demands a large amount of effort and is time-consuming [162].\n\
    Another similar example of the method selection problem is the case of ML. FSC\
    \ data\nallows different variables of interest to be predicted under diverse scenarios,\
    \ ranging from\nﬁsh farming production to agriculture. These characteristics of\
    \ the production context\ninﬂuence ML method performance, and selecting the most\
    \ appropriate method from a\npool of candidates is a time-consuming task. Thus,\
    \ the automation of choosing the best CI\ntechnique from a predeﬁned set of methods\
    \ of the same family is a crucial challenge that\ncould help increase inclusion\
    \ of CI into the FSC.\nCurrently, there are well-established automated approaches\
    \ focused on ML and DL.\nTherefore, we can use the automation of complete ML or\
    \ DL workﬂows, known as Auto-\nmated Machine learning (AutoML) [163] and Automated\
    \ Deep learning (AutoDL) [164].\nSuch approaches are considered to be promising\
    \ strategies to reduce human effort and\ntime cost of ML and DL in research areas\
    \ in which specialized knowledge is an asset\nthat is not always available or\
    \ affordable. Particularly, AutoML and AutoDL seek to ﬁnd\ncompetitive ML pipelines\
    \ (the workﬂow from data preprocessing to model selection) and\nneural network\
    \ architectures automatically without almost any human intervention. The\ncentral\
    \ purpose is maximizing or minimizing a performance metric on input data without\n\
    it having to be specialized in the problem domain where the data comes.\nAutoML\
    \ and AutoDL methods have been successfully used in other areas [165,166].\nHowever,\
    \ an extensive analysis to determine their strengths and weaknesses has not been\n\
    carried out in very diverse learning tasks, such as FSCs. Additionally, the concept\
    \ of\nAutoML and AutoDL could be extrapolated to an even broader space, such as\
    \ automated\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n27 of 34\ncomputational intelligence. In\
    \ this case, the focus would be on supporting non-expert\nusers in selecting other\
    \ CI techniques like meta-heuristics and its sub-families (e.g., EC,\nSI, local-based\
    \ approaches). In this context, the research challenge lies in the design and\n\
    development of automated methods for other families of CI methods, including fuzzy\n\
    logic, meta-heuristic, probabilistic methods, and others.\n5.2.5. Interoperability\
    \ and Deployment of CI with Information and\nCommunication Technologies\nCI is\
    \ only one part of the entire ICT ecosystem required to digitize processes in\
    \ the\nFSC. IoT technologies, information storage and management technologies,\
    \ data analytic\nand visualization tools, or decision support technologies are\
    \ other relevant components\nwithout which CI cannot reach its full potential.\
    \ All these technologies have switched the\nfocus from traditional automation\
    \ of FSC processes to a cloud-based paradigm where all\nICTs operate efﬁciently\
    \ and intuitively [167]. Within the cloud-based approaches, major\ntechnologies\
    \ must be able to interoperate with each other and themselves. Thus, such\ninterconnectivity\
    \ and exchange of information are some of the main challenges raised\nwhen incorporating\
    \ CI and other industry 4.0 approaches into the daily operation and\nmanagement\
    \ of FSCs [168].\nOne of the latent issues is the lack of standardization of the\
    \ data models with CI\nmethods. Ultimately the goal of Industry 4.0 in FSCs is\
    \ to incorporate semantic interoper-\nability, which enables systems to exchange\
    \ information with unambiguous meaning [169].\nHowever, the study of interoperability\
    \ standards for CI approaches is a research area that\nstill needs to be fully\
    \ exploited. The demand for these standards is also growing at a\npace never seen\
    \ before, as the current trend of Industry 4.0 is characterized by complex\nautomation\
    \ and production systems where CI works with a wide variety of standards,\ncomponents,\
    \ and services in a cloud-based environment [170]. Despite such challenges, re-\n\
    cent advances have been made in interoperability standards for cloud-based environments.\n\
    Some examples are the interoperable cloud-based manufacturing system [171], the\
    \ hybrid\nmanufacturing cloud framework [172], and the new generation artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence-driven\nintelligent manufacturing architecture [173].\nAnother\
    \ big challenge of CI in integration with ICTs lies in the manufacturing pro-\n\
    cesses of the FSC production stage. Nowadays, CI approaches are usually focused\
    \ on\nmaximizing accuracy without considering the resources they consume. Nevertheless,\
    \ with\nthe increasing demand of developing a globally low carbon economy, the\
    \ need to build an\nintelligent and environmentally friendly food industry is\
    \ becoming more urgent [174,175].\nIn this sense, CI approaches require that a\
    \ balance be struck between the computational\nresources they use, the energy\
    \ they consume, and the performance they can achieve in the\ntime-frame allowed\
    \ by food manufacturing processes [176]. Furthermore, the aforemen-\ntioned resources\
    \ are assets that are not always available in small- and medium-sized food\nindustries.\
    \ Therefore, more research is required to develop CI methods that are capable\n\
    of being deployed in IoT devices and smart manufacturing industries under different\n\
    constraints like energy efﬁciency and computational resources. In conclusion,\
    \ this research\npath could imply bringing in the concepts of edge computing and\
    \ fog computing [177] for\nthe efﬁcient inclusion of CI in food manufacturing\
    \ processes [178].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S.A.-Z., A.A.-V.\

    irrigation system

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    , to name but a few. IoT has already helped tag the tigers from forests and cows
    from farming fields for identification and tracking. Smart wearable technologies
    have been embedded into the human body for health monitoring. Recently, IoT has
    become the backbone of a rising new distributed computing paradigm, called Fog
    Computing, also known as Edge Computing. Fog Computing is the latest distributed
    computing model that extends the Cloud Computing vision. The main advantage of
    the Fog paradigm is that it brings partial computation and storage right at the
    edge of the network, thus helping to reduce latency and the Internet bandwidth
    bottlenecks. With this background, this book chapter presents a detailed literature
    analysis using the Web of Science and Relecura software . This chapter also outlines
    fundamentals of Fog Computing such as its characteristics, models, theories, and
    different applications. Moreover, various upcoming technologies and frameworks
    have also been illustrated for better understanding of the Fog Computing phenomenon.

    amounts of money on salaries for the technology experts in planning, designing,
    coding, developing hardware , software , and networking products and services.
    These are direct products or technologies embedded into physical things to bring
    operational efficiency in objects and systems, in relation to the Internet of
    Things (IoT) vision. It has been widely misunderstood that IoT technologies are
    limited to sensors and radio frequency identification. This is certainly not the
    case. Sophisticated technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-fi, ZigBee, EPC, Barcode,
    QR codes, IPv4/6, Microcontrollers, Sensors, Actuators, Pumps, Social media, 4G/5G,
    Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Ambience intelligence, Web 3.0, Big Data Analytics,
    Cloud Computing , and many more are under the IoT umbrella [1]. In fact, the IoT
    technologies extend even further to cover all the existing software together with
    existing operating systems such as Windows 16, Linux, SuSE Linux, Macintosh, Ubuntu,
    Android, Sun Solaris, Unisys, CP/M, and upcoming Urban Operating Systems. Electronic
    hardware devices including computers, laptops, servers, tablets, and smartphones
    are the backbone of the IoT environment. These technologies are helping human
    life become more comfortable, modifying public utility services to make them better
    fit for the purpose, home automation, educational performance, good governance
    practices, automated manufacturing process, defence services, and healthcare—all
    in a big way. Most of these technologies are already in existence and in the public
    domain, except the technologies that are in advanced version usages. Using these
    technologies, even objects such as the tables, chairs, curtains, windows, fridges,
    washing machines, clothes, and glasses can be connected to the Future Internet
    (FI). Even the mountains, lakes, and forests can get connected via the Wi-Fi or
    local wired connections for monitoring and securing them from willful damage.
    In fact, natural or man-made inanimate objects can become capable of interacting
    with the Homo sapiens! European countries, Singapore, Korea, Japan, China, and
    other South Asian countries are proactively developing newer IoT technologies
    for better business, effective operational efficiency and improved day-to-day
    human life. Several collaborative projects in designing the hardware , software
    , and networking products are underway. Some researchers are working on IoT architectures,
    their inter-operability, and security mechanisms during data transmission among
    IoT devices. Many multinational corporates, firms, organizations, and universities
    have entered into a common understanding for developing IoT products under the
    umbrella of the IPSO alliance. Another significant factor is the security of devices
    and data transmission, for which many multinational corporate giants are in the
    line, developing better high standard security software and mechanisms. Even International
    cyber laws are coming into practice for the security of personal data. A humongous
    amount of data is being generated by different objects getting connected to the
    Internet. Benefits are numerous, however, computational issues, storage scarcity,
    lack of speed capacity, and security concerns are a few of the challenges that
    face the new technologies. In order to solve these issues, a new technology christened
    as “Fog Computing ” has been gradually gaining foothold in the market. Importantly,
    widespread adoption of the Fog Computing paradigm requires the development of
    new network architectures and middleware platforms deploying new emerging communication
    technologies such as 5G, edge analytics tools for IoT, big data, and machine learning
    of novel context-aware management approaches. Fog Computing is proposed to enable
    computing directly at the edge of network, closer to the devices that generate
    and require processing of data, to deliver new applications for billions of connected
    devices [2]. The organization of this book chapter is as follows. The next section
    discusses the existing literature in some detail. The third section focuses on
    principles, characteristics, and concepts of Cloud and Fog Computing. The next
    section is devoted to discussing the models and Cloud/Fog architectures, and the
    last but not the least section presents the conclusion. 2 Literature Review—Analysis
    2.1 Methodology The present literature review analysis on Fog Computing was purely
    dependent on secondary data. The secondary data was collated from the Web of Science
    , which is maintained by M/s. Thomson and Reuters. It is now known as a part of
    Clarivate Analytics. Importantly, only the indexed articles in the Web of Science
    database were considered for this study. The research articles were collected
    in February 2018. This Web of Science database is widely acknowledged by researchers
    as one of best, yielding empirically-proven articles, manuscripts and whitepapers
    for academicians, researchers, and corporate personnel alike. In total, 746 articles
    were obtained from the Web of Science database regarding Fog Computing. The articles
    published during the period from 2011 to 10 February 2018 were included in this
    study. The keywords used to collate the article were “Fog Computing” and “Edge
    Computing”. The purpose of this analysis was to analyse the Fog Computing paradigm,
    with emphasis on the concepts, principles, models, and prominent contributors
    in this domain. The literature analysis will help in understanding the fundamentals
    of Fog Computing through explanatory figures, statistics, and tables. 2.2 Literature
    Analysis Using Web of Science The phenomenon of Fog Computing traces its beginning
    to the year 2011. Soon after, computer scientists, IT experts, engineers, and
    mobile computing developers started developing Fog Computing-related hardware
    , software , and networking components in a bigger way. Figure 2.1 demonstrates
    the year-wise publications on this topic. 282 articles were published in 2017,
    which was the highest figure obtained during 2011–2018. It is likely that this
    figure for the year 2018 goes up as the present study has only considered for
    the period of 1 January–11 February 2018. The year 2016 followed next, with 230
    articles, followed by 100 publications in the year 2015. The period between 2011
    and 2017 showed a steady growth rate in the number of publications, which indicates
    that the phenomenon is gaining popularity, touching human life through more and
    more applications. Remarkably, Fog Computing is an interdisciplinary subject.
    It marries all the elements involved in providing human comfort, connecting several
    allied subjects. In the last 7 years, the applications developed relating to this
    phenomenon of Fog Computing include Computer Science, Engineering, Telecommunications,
    Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, Medical Imaging, Optics, Oncology, Instruments Instrumentation,
    Transportation, Chemistry, Meteorology Atmospheric Sciences, Electrochemistry,
    Imaging Science, Photographic Technology, Physics, Automation Control Systems,
    Neurosciences, Remote Sensing, Materials Science, Science Technology, Cardiovascular
    System, Cardiology, and Energy Fuels to name a few. Figure 2.2 provides the percentage-based

    publications during the period being considered in this study. China comes a close
    second, with 139 periodicals to its credit. Interestingly, third in line is Italy
    with 70 publications. The others in line are Australia (52), South Korea (50),

    to Fog Computing research. Thus, research and development in Fog Computing is
    gaining popularity across countries. The International Journal of Fog Computing,
    through its publications, aims to provide an international forum for researchers
    to discuss and address these challenges and propose innovative solutions, products,
    theories, and concepts for seamless future computing infrastructures now and future.

    Software Several multinational IT-related companies started working in planning,
    designing, and developing the innovative Fog Computing technological products
    and services to increase their business. These firms are working towards new hardware
    , software and networking products, which shall possess embedding and interoperable
    capabilities. On the other side, the companies are filing their new innovative
    products and then striving to obtain Intellectual Property Rights in the form
    of patents , being pioneers for particular technologies. Some individual scientists
    and companies are selling their patents to other companies and R&D centres to
    convert them into real-time products. In this scenario, authors are conducting
    Fog Computing patent analysis to discuss the state-of-the-art of Fog Computing
    products and services at the global level. This is likely to help other competitors
    innovate accordingly, reduce monopoly, and increase consumer convenience. For
    patent analysis, Relecura software was used to categorise companies’ portfolios
    into multi-level classifications, determine the strengths and gaps in the portfolio,
    and plan for adequate patent coverage. This software helps track companies’ needs
    for in-licensing or acquiring patents. This will be used to identify patents for
    sale or licensing and generate leads for the same. Patent documents contain important
    research results. However, they are lengthy and rich in technical terminology
    such that it takes plenty of human efforts for analysis. Automatic tools for assisting
    patent engineers or decision-makers in patent analysis are in great demand. Thus,
    patent analysis is a unique emerging management tool all around the globe for
    addressing the strategic management of business technologies, new products, and
    service development processes. Table 2.1 and Fig. 2.5 illustrate patent analysis
    using the Relecura software. Table 2.1 Countrywide patent analysis on fogging
    Full size table Fig. 2.5 Country wise—patent analysis on fogging Full size image
    Figure 2.5 depicts the number of patents filed by different countries across the
    globe in the field of Fog Computing . The European countries, EP [European Patent
    Office] won 2 patens in 2012 and 1 in 2015, whereas WO [WIPO (PCT)] also obtained
    3 patents in the same period. In contrast, China bagged a good number of patents
    compared to the other countries. The USA bagged 13 patents from the year 2011
    onwards. Clearly, Fog/Edge Computing technologies are attracting the attention
    of researchers, entrepreneurs, and academicians all over the world. 3 Principles
    Fog Computing is a hyper term that is often used as a substitute to Cloud Computing,
    though there are differences, as will be illustrated in the discussion below.
    Fog Computing is a new concept that extends the cloud computing model to the edge
    of the computing networks, much closer to where the devices, that generate data,
    exist. Fogging provides computation, data storage, and application services to
    the end user. This facilitates a new variety of applications and services [3].
    As the Internet of Things (IoT ) phenomenon matures into reality, a vast number
    of devices are going to connect to the Future Internet (FI). Every physical thing
    and object that will be connected to the Future Internet shall generate a huge
    volume of data each nanosecond, in the range of Giga-, Tera-, Peta-, Exa- and
    Zetta-bytes, and perhaps even in Yottabytes. Hence, the existing storage infrastructure
    with cloud computing may not be capable of carrying out the required processing
    in the required time. Data transmission bandwidth does not possess the required
    calibre to accommodate all this data on a single occasion, given the voluminous
    data generated by multiple heterogeneous devices, and fast data transmission rates.
    Further, unnecessary data transmissions in the unwanted networks of Wide Area
    Networks, State Area Networks, Metropolitan Area Networks, Local Area Networks,
    and Home Area Networks are also to be processed. Given this scenario, the concept
    of Fog Computing comes to the rescue. Cloud computing has established itself as
    an alternative of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and service model.
    However, as with all logically centralized resources and service provisioning
    infrastructures, the cloud does not efficiently handle local issues involving
    a large number of networked elements and it is not responsive enough for many
    applications that require the immediate attention of a local controller [4]. As
    we discussed above, the traditional cloud-based infrastructures are not enough
    for the current demands of IoT applications. Two major issues are the limitations
    in terms of latency time and network bandwidth. The study conducted by Bierzynski
    et al. [5] reveal that in recent years, the concepts of Fog Computing or Edge
    Computing were proposed to improve these limitations by moving data processing
    capabilities closer to the network edge. The term Fog Computing is frequently
    associated with the networking multinational company “Cisco ”. It is believed
    that Mr. Ginny Nichols, Cisco’s product line manager coined the term, and hence
    he has been credited as the father of Fog Computing. While “Cisco Fog Computing”
    is a registered name, Fog Computing is open to the community at large. Cisco recently
    delivered the vision of Fog Computing to enable applications on billions of connected
    devices to run directly at the network edge. Customers can develop, manage, and
    run software applications on the Cisco framework of networked devices, including
    hardened routers and switches. The OpenFog Consortium was founded in November
    2015 by members from Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, ARM and the Princeton University.
    The main intention of the “OpenFog Consortium” mission was to develop open reference
    architecture and convey the business value of Fog Computing. Fog Computing is
    arguably the next frontier for accelerating IoT connections, offering increased
    speed, performance, and a multitude of other benefits. Fog Computing is a highly
    virtualized platform that provides computing, storage, and networking services
    between end devices and traditional Cloud Computing Data Centres, typically, but
    not exclusively located at the edge of the network. This means that Fog Computing
    provides data, computing, storage, and application services to end users. Some
    believe that Prof. Salvatore J. Stolfo, coined “Fog Computing” as “fogging”. Fog
    Computing is defined as a disseminated computing infrastructure in which the applications
    and services are handled either at the network edge or in a remote data centre
    cloud. Therefore, in this requirement, the networking “Switches” and “Mugs” and
    smart devices themselves become the calculating devices to carry out the computing
    process within nanoseconds, for local computing. The concept of Fog Computing
    was introduced by Cisco [6], as an analogy to Cloud Computing, as clouds are far
    away from earth, but the fog is closer. Hence, the term Fog Computing is considered
    to mimic the limited form of cloud behaviour, located nearer to end users. Fog
    Computing was specifically introduced to facilitate latency-sensitive applications
    and broader IoT vision. To mitigate real-time, mobility, and location awareness,
    edge technologies such as fog, mobile edge, cloudlets, and micro-data centres
    are foreseen as the Internet of Everything (IoE) enabling technologies [7]. That
    means that Fog Computing is open to the community at large. The choice of the
    word “fog” is meant to convey the idea that the advantages of cloud computing
    should be brought closer to the data source. In meteorology, “fog” is simply a
    cloud that is close to the ground. The cloud is migrating to the edge of the network,
    where routers themselves may become the virtualization infrastructure, in an evolution
    labelled as “the fog” [8]. With this technology, every smart building/home can
    have their own Fog Computing facilities for smart homeowners using smart mobiles
    or devices. Fog Computing is better suited than cloud computing for meeting the
    demands of numerous emerging applications such as self-driving cars, traffic lights,
    smart homes, etc. However, it cannot replace cloud computing totally—as cloud
    will still be preferred for high-end batch processing jobs that are very common
    in the global business world. Hence, we can arrive at the conclusion that Fog
    Computing and Cloud Computing will complement each other while having their own
    advantages and disadvantages. Fog (Edge) computing plays a crucial role in the
    Internet of Things environment. New studies related to privacy , security , system
    reliability, and security mechanisms in the Fog Computing platform are topics
    for fundamental research and need to be explored. Fog Computing will grow in helping
    the emerging network paradigms that require faster processing with less delay,
    whereas cloud computing would help the business community meet their high-end
    computing demands and lower their costs based on a utility pricing and the reliability
    of the networks of smart devices. Combining the reliability requirements of grid
    and cloud paradigms with the reliability requirements of networks of sensor and
    actuators, it follows that designing a reliable Fog Computing platform is a feasible
    model. Hence, the Fog Computing paradigm can be perceived as a non-trivial extension
    of the cloud [9]. This puts some types of transactions and resources at the edge
    of a communication network rather than establishing channels for cloud storage
    and utilisation. Fog Computing exponents debate that it can reduce the need for
    bandwidth by simply not sending every bit of information over cloud channels,
    and instead, gathering it at certain access points, such as modern routers. This
    computation allows for a more strategic compilation of data that may not be needed
    in cloud storage right away, if at all. By using this kind of distributed strategy,
    company’s project managers can ensure lower costs, quicker processing and improved
    efficiencies of systems. In the Fog Computing environment, processing takes place
    in a data hub on a smart device like smart or android mobile, or in a smart router
    or mugs or network gateways. This reduces the amount of data sent to the cloud
    via a network. It must be especially noted that the fog networking complements
    do not replace cloud computing at any point of time; fogging allows for short-term
    analytics at the edge, whereas the cloud computing technology performs resource-intensive
    and longer-term analytics. Initially, while the edge devices and sensors are where
    the data is created and composed, they do not have the computation and storage
    resources to perform advanced analytics and machine learning tasks. Though cloud
    servers have the power to do these, they are often too far away to process the
    data and respond in a timely manner. In addition, having all endpoints connecting
    to and sending raw data to the cloud over the Internet can have privacy, security
    and legal implications, especially when dealing with sensitive data subject to
    regulations in different countries. In this scenario, fogging is the best available
    method. Fog Computing has many advantages for services in numerous fields, such
    as Wireless Sensor Networks, Smart Grid, Internet of Things, and Software-Defined
    Networks (SDNs). However, some general issues associated with Fog Computing are
    privacy, trust, and security service migration among Fog Computing devices. The
    Global Fog Computing Market revenue is expected to reach $556.72 million by 2023,
    growing at a CAGR of around 61.63% during the forecast period 2017–2023. 3.1 Characteristics
    Fog Computing extends the cloud computing paradigm to the edge of the network,
    thus enabling a new breed of applications and services [6]. Characteristics of
    Fog Computing include: Low latency and location awareness, Widespread geographical
    distribution, Mobility, A large number of network nodes, Predominant role of wireless
    access, The strong presence of streaming and real-time applications, Heterogeneity.
    Some authors have defined the Fog Computing physiognomies as follows: The main
    characteristic being that it is an edge location, with location awareness, and
    low latency, which means that Fog Computing supports endpoints with the finest
    services at the edge of the network. Secondly, its Geographical distribution has
    been very attractive in that the services and applications in the fog are widely
    distributed across spaces and nations. In sharp contrast to the more centralized
    Cloud, the services and applications targeted by Fog Computing demand widely distributed
    deployments. The Fog, for instance, will play an active role in delivering high
    quality streaming to moving vehicles, through proxies and access points positioned
    along highways and tracks [10]. The third attribute is support for mobility, i.e.,
    using LISP protocol fog devices to provide mobility techniques like decoupling
    host identity to location identity. That means it is essential for many Fog and
    Edge computing applications to communicate directly with mobile and other smart
    or computational devices. Hence, the support for mobility techniques, such as
    the LISP protocol, which decouple host identity from location identity and require
    a distributed directory system are required. Ability for Real-time interactions
    in another attribute and an essential requirement. Fog Computing requires real-time
    interactions for speedy service without any interruptions. Sky is the limit for
    connectivity of heterogeneous devices in the network. Fog nodes can be deployed
    in a wide variety of environments. These environments include the heterogeneity
    objects or devices such as computers, servers, laptops, printers, pagers, and
    smartphones as well as physical objects including both living and non-living things.
    Hence, one may well imagine a home where everything—from appliances to pet animals—is
    connected to the Internet. Interoperability is one of the vital networking communication
    characteristics in Fog Computing. This explains how different hardware devices
    or IoT objects interact and cooperate during the data transmission process by
    software through various networks. Fog components must be able to interoperate
    in order to give a wide range of services such as platform-independent streaming.
    The end object is to improve the quality of life of general public . To do so,
    one will have to overcome bandwidth limitations, increasing computing capabilities
    and storages in these heterogeneous environments, and fogging technology is the
    best method to fulfil these requirements. Table 2.2 delineates the differences
    between Cloud and Fog Computing [11]. Table 2.2 Difference between cloud and fog
    computing Full size table 3.2 Concepts The Fog Computing technology offers a number
    of benefits in the computing and communication arena. As defined by Cisco in one
    of their research papers, “by moving data processing and delivery closer to the
    requesting devices through the expansion of their geographic network footprint
    and operating in node-based fog architecture rather than in either cloud or traditional
    systems, response times to customers can be improved almost exponentially”. Nearness
    is the major contributor to network efficiency, and the effect of moving data
    towards the consumer along a communication network path through such fog nodes
    simply cannot be overstated. The increased network efficiency through proximity
    multiplies many of the benefits of the classic architecture while avoiding the
    drawbacks of such. As part of this movement towards network nodes, congestion
    on the network is likewise drastically reduced. In the traditional architectural
    paradigm, the total of processing is being demanded in a rather centralised system.
    Essentially, standard architectures are glorified bottlenecks in all but a few
    specific use cases, where data is trapped in a looping hold pattern. Thus, Fog
    Computing gets around this by distributing this functionality across a much wider
    space. While cloud distribution can indeed be negated by some solutions, it is
    problematic, as it also means that network response as a whole suffers, even with
    multiplexing and other load balancing solutions. Users may still face bottlenecks,
    but the concept of load balancing has been amply made use of, resulting in quicker
    data delivery and better network efficiency. As more nodes become necessary, dormant
    nodes can be spun and utilised. Fog Computing also boasts of impressive scaling
    abilities. Working with nodes implies geographical nearness to the data request.
    This also indicates a boost in security —data is encoded as it moves towards the
    edge of the network; and changing node relations and presence means that the user
    attack surface is ever changing. End devices, fog and cloud form a three-layer
    hierarchical service delivery model, supporting a range of applications such as
    web content delivery [12], augmented reality [13], and big data analysis [14].
    However, several challenges are also associated with the Fog/Edge Computing. The
    major disadvantage of the Fog technology and architecture is that it intensifies
    the complexity of the communication network, and thus, adds a certain amount of
    overhead in business terms—both directly and indirectly. Furthermore, implementing
    Edge Computing means that the user is introducing an ever-increasing number of
    points of failure. While privacy and security are benefited in a way by this constant
    change, the maintenance and probability aspects are not. Besides, the security
    and privacy should be addressed in every layer while designing the fog Computing
    system [15]. In old-style solutions, the user has a single point of failure with
    centralised effort to repair, maintain, and identify potential issues in the Fog
    Computing architecture. By spreading out the computational load, users are spreading
    out that effort and responsibility, which can make for stress on the entire Fog
    Computing process. Fog is another layer of a distributed network environment and
    is closely associated with cloud computing and the Internet of Things . 4 Models/Architectures
    No standard architectures and tested models have been derived from empirical research.
    However, some of the Fog Computing architectures have been described in the following
    sections for better understanding of the Fog vision. 4.1 A Generic Fog Computing
    Architecture Mind Commerce [22] has outlined a generic Fog Computing architecture
    that consists of the following elements: IoT endpoints: which include end devices
    like sensors , gateways, edge devices, and other physical computing objects that
    perform the required functions and provide apps that are installed on the end
    devices. These devices are generally connected to a data storage. The IoT endpoints
    collect the data from other different devices; process some data in real-time
    in the IP network data processing units. The rest of the data is stored in a Cloud
    environment for further processing. IP (Internet Protocol) Network: that provides
    distributed intelligence and is linked to IoT End-point devices (e.g. sensors)
    to receive data from and also to the Cloud environment to send required data for
    storage purposes and future analysis. Purpose is mainly to provide communication
    links. the IP network utilises distributed intelligence for supporting intelligence
    representation e.g. big data mining etc. Distributed Intelligence is considered
    as a collective intelligence that provides an effective theoretical framework
    for understanding what humans can achieve and how artefacts, tools, and socio-technical
    environments can be designed and evaluated to empower human beings. Centralised
    Control and Mediation Unit: which is a cloud-based unit in the Cloud environment
    where the remaining data, which was not processed in the data processing unit,
    is stored and analysed, as required. This unit is used for storage, queries, and
    business analytics. 4.2 Fog Computing Environmental Model Zhu et al. [16], in
    their seminal research paper “Improving website performance using edge servers
    in Fog Computing architecture” structured the Fog Computing Environmental Model.
    This model has been presented in Fig. 2.6. They have divided the entire Fog Computing
    environment into three layers as follows: Fig. 2.6 Fog computer architecture (adapted
    from [16]) Full size image Centralised Intelligence: Cloud Computing Here, Data
    Centre Cloud may be employed for services for application hosting, management.
    The Core Networking and Services are responsible for Internet Protocols (IP),
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Quality of Service, Multicast, Data Security
    , Network Services, and Mobile Packet Core functions. Distributed Intelligence:
    Fog Computing This layer is the primary one at the edge level. It may also be
    called Multi-Service Edge. In this layer, 3G/4G/Long-Term Evolution (LTE), Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technologies and other such
    can be encountered. This is much like the field area network. Distributed Intelligence:
    End-Point Computing It can alternatively be called the Smart Things Network. This
    layer consists of several embedding systems, objects and sensors . This indicates
    that smart and less smart things like vehicles and machines are connected via
    wired and wireless connections. 4.3 A Fog Computing Architecture by Joud Khattab
    [21] The Fog Computing model (Fig. 2.7) by Joud Khattab was published in August,
    2017. In this approach, the Fog Architecture has been divided into seven layers,
    as briefly articulated below. Fig. 2.7 Fog computer architecture by Joud Khattab
    (adapted from [21]) Full size image IoT Sensors and Actuators The bottom-most
    layer of the architecture in Fig. 2.7 is formed by IoT sensors and actuators.
    This layer is geographically distributed and possesses sensing, communication,
    and application objectives, directing the fetched values to the next layers via
    gateways for further processing. The IoT actuators play an important role in this
    layer as they are responsible for controlling the mechanism or IoT system. They
    fetch the data from the remote sensors and convert them into mechanical or electrical
    moments. The actuator usually responds to the sensors that sense the changes in
    the environmental deviations. Fog Devices The next layer of the architecture has
    the “Fog Devices” that consist of gateways for connecting the sensors to the Internet,
    edge devices and physical computing devices. This layer is capable of hosting
    the different sorts of application modules. Data Generation The collected data
    from different sensors, RFID and other IoT devices is processed further through
    this layer; of this, some data can be used for real-time processing; some of the
    rest can be sent to a Cloud environment. An enormous amount of data is generated
    at this layer. Infrastructure Monitoring This layer is mainly responsible for
    the monitoring of resource utilisation, availability of sensors, actuators, and
    IP network. It monitors and keeps track of the services and applications deployed
    on the infrastructure. Depending on the requirement, the monitoring component
    supplies the gathered information to other services and application objectives.
    Resource Management The core layer of Fog architecture is resource management.
    It consists of computational components that systematically manage resources in
    such a way that resource wastage is virtually minimised to zero. This layer has
    a uniform and programmable interface for seamless resource management of hardware
    and controlling. It provides generic Application Process Interfaces (APIs) for
    monitoring, and controlling physical resources such as CPU, Memory, network and
    IoT devices. In this layer, the placement and scheduler components are the most
    important parts as they keep track of the state of available resources. Application
    Model This layer of Fog architecture consists of the sense-process-actuate model
    in which the sensor publishes measured data either periodically or in an event-based
    manner. Applications running on Fog devices subscribe to and process data coming
    from the sensors. Finally, insights obtained from the processing are translated
    into actions forwarded to actuators. Two relevant models are briefly described
    below. Sense-process-actuate model: The information collected by sensors is transmitted
    as data streams, which is acted upon by applications running on fog devices and
    the resultant commands are sent to actuators. Stream-processing model: The stream-processing
    model has a network of application modules running on fog devices that continuously
    process data streams emitted from sensors. The information mined from the incoming
    streams is stored in data centres for large-scale and long-term analytics. We
    consider stream-processing model as a subcategory of the sense-process-actuate
    model [17]. IoT Applications No field, societal or commercial, has been left untouched
    by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT scenarios includes healthcare,
    manufacturing, governance, urbanisation, home automation, citizen security , education,
    transportation, defence and many more [18]. 4.4 Fog Computing Tree Model Figure
    2.8 shows another proposed architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT ) environment.
    This has been called the “Tree Model”. It describes the IoT architecture consisting
    of three layers. It has been developed based on the IoT Forum Architecture, ITU
    Architecture, and European FP7 Research Project ARM models of IoT Architectures.
    The model is an addition to IoT-ARM (Architectural Reference Model) by the FP7
    Research Project. The approach describes the components including connectivity
    among them and process flow. IoT “Tree Model” is like a tree structure with roots,
    trunk and unlimited leaves [19], [20]. The three components of the Tree Model
    are the Processing, Transportation and Application Layer s, as elaborated below.
    Fig. 2.8 Fog computing view of IoT —A tree model Full size image Processing Layer
    For every tree, roots are the base and they are essential for the growth and entire
    life of the tree. Similarly, in an IoT architecture, Processing Layer is the principal
    layer in the global IoT world, with interoperable capabilities. This layer generally
    has the computing and embedding abilities with different physical objects or things.
    The relevant technologies help in the identification of the objects, securing
    them, and monitoring the events. Of course, these technologies are also capable
    of conducting automation based on the protocols defined in the network connection
    and may end up controlling even human beings. A few of the technologies involved
    in the Processing Layer include Smart Cards, Radio Frequency Identification, Electronic
    Product Codes, Barcode, IPv4/6, QR Codes, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Sensors,
    Actuators, Hyper Text Mark-up Language 5, robotics, microcontrollers, Big Data
    Analytics, Urban Operating Systems, Windows, Linux, Android, and Social Networking.
    Network Layer The Networking Layer is placed between the Processing and Application
    Layer . However, there are no hard and fast rules that fixate this sequence and
    in Fog Computing , the Processing Layer and Application Layer are likely to be
    embedded into each other. In the Network layer, there are sub-networks consisting
    of Home Area Network (HAN), LAN, MAN, SAN, WAN, and overlapping. HAN is a new
    and relatively unknown network. All the home appliances including towels, shirts,
    utensils, windows, doors, tables, fans, fridges, radiators and so on can get connected
    to the Internet through smart mobile/devices for easy automation. To ensure ease
    of application, this Network Layer has high bandwidth capabilities, and high data
    rate speeds for the transmission of yottabytes of data. The 5G mobile and NG9-1-1
    technologies are soon likely to be in place to further enhance the capabilities.
    Fog Computing will occur via switches, thermostats, actuators and smart mobile
    devices of this networking layer. Application Layer The Application layer is similar
    to leaves of the “Tree”. Like the uncountable leaves on a tree, the IoT Application
    layer consists of a gamut of applications including transportation, security ,
    governance, education, health, pharmacy, logistics, manufacturing and process
    industries. Beside these, Application Layers support the technologies for improved
    Quality of Life in urban areas in public utility services. These services include
    power management, water management, waste management and irrigation management.
    In fact, even mining processes can be monitored through this and the monitoring
    of natural ecosystems including ponds, forest, lakes, and mountains also is possible,
    too. IoT has brought about a tremendous number of services for round-the-clock
    provision of Quality of Life. 5 Conclusion Fog Computing-based systems are becoming
    important in our daily lives. It is amply clear from the above discussions that
    Fog Computing will, in future, be omnipresent and pervading across all disciplines,
    social and commercial. Through this, even earthen things are likely to get high
    calibre computation capabilities, through the inclusion of basic electronic devices
    and embedded processing capabilities. The beauty of this technology is that all
    smart devices, including smart phones, already possess this computation technology.
    The user-oriented applications are already fully loaded in almost all these mobiles.
    These applications include Google, music, album, movies, camera, calendar, maps,
    alarms, Facebook, Twitter, navigation, voice speech, Hangouts, voice dialler,
    WhatsApp, notes, Email and so on. Edge technologies can be used to assist free-view
    videos by offering virtual view synthesis and related multi-view video incentives.
    All these applications require local storage and high-speed real-time processing,
    along with high-speed connected bandwidth to perform edge computing. Even in the
    case of home automation, smart devices are coming on board with facilities such
    as computation, residential tracking, sensing and adapting the IoT environments
    through Ambient Intelligence (AmI), as well as manipulation of databases in real-time
    situations. All the IT-related companies are developing IoT products and services
    to interoperable Fog Computing hardware , software , and networking. However,
    researchers still have much work to do on the fundamentals of Fogging and its
    allied applications to develop standard Fogging models and architectures. References

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have taken a giant leap in scale, expanding\
    \ their applica-\nbility to a large variety of technological domains and applications,\
    \ ranging from the Internet of things\n(IoT) for smart cities and smart homes\
    \ to wearable technology healthcare applications, underwater,\nagricultural and\
    \ environmental monitoring and many more. This expansion is rapidly growing every\n\
    passing day in terms of the variety, heterogeneity and the number of devices which\
    \ such applications\nsupport. Data collection is commonly the core application\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks, which are\ntypically composed of a large variety of\
    \ devices, some constrained by their resources (e.g., processing,\nstorage, energy)\
    \ and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges span all the conceptual\n\
    communication layers, from the Physical to the Applicational. Many novel solutions\
    \ devised in the\npast do not scale well with the exponential growth in the population\
    \ of the devices and need to\nbe adapted, revised, or new innovative solutions\
    \ are required to comply with this massive growth.\nFurthermore, recent technological\
    \ advances present new opportunities which can be leveraged in\nthis context.\
    \ This paper provides a cross-layer perspective and review of data gathering in\
    \ WSN and\nIoT networks. We provide some background and essential milestones that\
    \ have laid the foundation\nof many subsequent solutions suggested over the years.\
    \ We mainly concentrate on recent state-of-\nthe-art research, which facilitates\
    \ the scalable, energy-efﬁcient, cost-effective, and human-friendly\nfunctionality\
    \ of WSNs and the novel applications in the years to come.\nKeywords: wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs); Internet of things (IoT); data gathering; wearables;\n\
    compressed sensing; network coding; mobile sink; energy harvesting\n1. Introduction\n\
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are data measurement and gathering networks\nbased\
    \ on small hardware (HW) units capable of sensing, monitoring, or measuring their\n\
    surroundings. The sensed data are transmitted directly or by relay via other sensors\
    \ to\nsome sink or server or a base station. The ultimate objective of such a\
    \ conﬁguration is to\nprovide control or exploration capabilities over an area\
    \ where the network is deployed.\nWSN characteristics can vary substantially:\
    \ they can be composed of a few to hundreds of\nthousands of sensors; the monitored\
    \ terrain can range from a small coverage area (e.g., the\nhuman body) to a vast\
    \ realm (e.g., a forest area for ﬁre detection); the sensed variables of\ninterest\
    \ of the surroundings are diverse (e.g., weather or health parameters, acceleration,\n\
    pollution); and the sensors can have different characteristics (e.g., size, computational\n\
    power, energy source).\nThe Internet of things (IoT) aims to improve day-to-day\
    \ life. The concept includes\nsmart cities, smart homes, pervasive health care,\
    \ assisted living, environmental monitoring,\nsurveillance, and so on. The IoT\
    \ paradigm relies on interconnecting a large number of\ndevices (things) linked\
    \ by the Internet via heterogeneous access networks through which\nthey can exchange\
    \ information with one or more Internet gateways that can process the\ndata, take\
    \ action, and forward them to another destination if needed. Since many IoT\n\
    devices are expected to be wireless, and since sensing is one of the main tasks\
    \ and tools\nutilized by the IoT paradigm, IoT systems will rely extensively on\
    \ WSN technology. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22072650\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n2 of 44\nscale of\
    \ scenarios where WSN are deployed nowadays is vast. Traditionally, WSN were\n\
    classiﬁed based on their placement (e.g., terrestrial, underground, multimedia)\
    \ [1]. Since\nWSNs are closely associated with IoT, contemporary classiﬁcation\
    \ tends to re-attribute the\nnotions of the WSN domain to the IoT domain [2] and\
    \ classify them based on their primary\nobjectives, such as smart cities [3,4],\
    \ healthcare [5], retail and leisure [6], utilities (e.g., smart\nhome energy\
    \ control, water metering and leak detection, and other general infrastructure\n\
    monitoring networks) [7], agriculture and environmental safety (e.g., smart farming\
    \ and\nharvesting, pest control [8–10], seismology monitoring [11,12], oceanology\
    \ [13]), and more.\nAs previously explained, one of the main tasks of both WSN\
    \ and IoT systems is\ndata collection and dissemination. Reports are collected\
    \ from the devices, and updates\nand operational assignments are distributed.\
    \ Maintenance and functional assessments\nare also collected and disseminated.\
    \ Data collection and dissemination in very dense\nnetworks such as WSNs and IoT\
    \ networks which span heterogeneous devices, a signiﬁcant\npercentage of which\
    \ are expected to be small, with very constrained processing, storage,\nand energy\
    \ resources and with minimal network capabilities, is challenging and draws\n\
    signiﬁcant attention both by the industrial and academic communities. Some of\
    \ these\nchallenges include: (i) Information management — the amount of information\
    \ collected or\nneeding to be disseminated to the relevant entities is enormous,\
    \ and some is expected to be\nredundant, both in terms of the information sent\
    \ by each device, which can be compressed,\nand in terms of same information received\
    \ by different entities. Accordingly, innovative\ntechniques are required for\
    \ data compression to reduce transmitted data over wireless\nchannels and aggregation\
    \ techniques that exploit the redundancy between information sent\nby the different\
    \ entities. (ii) Data analysis and reaction — the expected vast data exchange\n\
    and the low latency requirement (at least for some of the information collected)\
    \ require\nprocessing and analysis of data in real-time or near real-time, to\
    \ enable timely decision\nmaking and instantaneous action-taking.\nThe ability\
    \ to successfully transmit and gather vast streams of data incoming from an\n\
    enormous number of devices and sensors and ﬁnally to successfully analyze them,\
    \ in order\nto automatically control a much larger scope of everyday life systems,\
    \ directly couples\nthe process of data gathering with Big Data related challenges\
    \ (e.g., [14–17]). Furthermore,\nleveraging Cloud Computing platforms offers signiﬁcant\
    \ advances in data analytical abil-\nities (e.g., [18–20]). It provides new horizons\
    \ to further develop and increase the size of\nWSN/IoT networks both in the sense\
    \ of the number of sensing units and in the sense of\nthe amount of the acquired\
    \ data (e.g., [21–23]). (iii) Connectivity — collecting and dissem-\ninating data\
    \ from and to many devices, potentially through vast, dense, heterogeneous\nnetworks,\
    \ will be one of the biggest challenges of the future of IoT; accordingly, novel\n\
    MAC protocols and coding schemes should be devised to comply with this challenge.\
    \ With\nthis respect, air time utilization and energy efﬁciency are of primary\
    \ importance for the\nMAC layer protocol design. Any MAC layer protocol should\
    \ ensure that devices utilize the\nwireless channel frugally and with minimum\
    \ energy consumption. (iv) Security and Pri-\nvacy — Connecting enormous numbers\
    \ of devices to the Internet exposes the IoT network\nto serious security vulnerabilities.\
    \ All the more so since the relevant entities are limited.\nAccordingly, issues\
    \ such as authenticity, data encryption, and vulnerability to attacks (e.g.,\n\
    device impersonation) are critical for the IoT paradigm’s continuous growth (e.g.,\
    \ [24]).\nIn addition, since the information transmitted over the WSN and IoT\
    \ networks can be\nhighly conﬁdential (e.g., health reports, device tracking),\
    \ the collection and dissemination\nof this information create signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ related to data protection and privacy.\nThis survey will explore the state-of-the-art\
    \ of data collection and dissemination as-\npects in WSNs and IoT environments\
    \ mentioned above. We will review essential milestones\nyet mainly focus on recent\
    \ publications and present the new trends and research directions.\nOur resources\
    \ included mainly Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and our university’s library\ndatabases,\
    \ utilizing the keywords of this paper. We also used important references from\n\
    the bilbiography of the initial papers and ones that cited them. Data collection\
    \ spans all the\nnetworking layers, from the physical implementation of transmitting\
    \ bits across a commu-\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n3 of 44\nnication medium to the\
    \ application layer. Due to the wide-ranging scope of the topic, we\nwill not\
    \ be able to cover all its aspects (for example, in this paper, we will not discuss\
    \ the\ncritical topic of security and privacy). Some of the issues will be covered\
    \ more thoroughly\nthan others. However, since some of the topics we discussed\
    \ rely on the general wireless\ncommunication technology and on broad setup protocols\
    \ which are not data-gathering ori-\nented per se, on some of the topics, we will\
    \ provide a more comprehensive background and\ndescribe protocols that are aimed\
    \ at a broader domain than data-gathering. For example,\nmany medium access control\
    \ (MAC) and wireless routing protocols are designed for a\nwide range of topologies,\
    \ trafﬁc patterns, quality of service requirements, etc. Even though\nthey can\
    \ be applied, they are not explicitly designed for data gathering. We will include\n\
    some more general yet essential studies in our survey. To grasp the whole picture\
    \ and to\nbetter understand some data-gathering-related issues, in some cases,\
    \ we will delve into the\npertinent background and stray into some peripheral\
    \ topics. We will cover topics related to\nall layers of the protocol stack. Sometimes\
    \ classiﬁcation based on a stack is not clear-cut, as\nsome of the issues involve\
    \ multiple stacks.\nIn particular, the survey comprises the following topics:\n\
    The device’s platform, which accommodates the sensing unit, can highly impact\
    \ the\nperformance of the application utilizing it and speciﬁcally the data-gathering\
    \ application,\nand vice versa, the application (e.g., data gathering) can impact\
    \ the platform architecture\nwhen designed in application-oriented manner or when\
    \ some of the essential features and\nrequirements are taken into account in the\
    \ platform design process. The same mutual\neffect also applies to the WSN infrastructure\
    \ and the network architecture (e.g., topology,\nsystem organization). We start\
    \ with reviewing studies pertaining to the general device’s\nplatform and infrastructure-related\
    \ novelties (Section 2). We cover new domains which\nwere only recently exposed\
    \ to WSN and IoT networks and introduced new opportunities for\nalgorithm design\
    \ in such networks. Some of these novel technologies have revolutionized\nthe\
    \ way applications can utilize each particular device as well as the shared network\
    \ and\nhave enabled new algorithm opportunities and design challenges across the\
    \ entire protocol\nstack which we describe throughout this survey.\nNext follows\
    \ Section 3 which provides a focused summary of recent advances in\ncompressed\
    \ sensing—a signal processing technique that can take advantage of sparsity\n\
    and redundancy of the data. In the context of data gathering procedures, compressed\n\
    sensing is utilized to reduce report payload at several levels, which include\
    \ reduction of\nthe sensed data size and the transmitted report size, by pruning\
    \ the devices that need to\nsend reports and by compressing the combined relayed\
    \ data before forwarding it toward\nits destination (the sink). We provide a basic\
    \ compressed sensing background and review\nthe state-of-the-art in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\nSection 4 considers the medium access control (MAC)\
    \ sublayer. In wireless communi-\ncation, channel utilization is critical and\
    \ broadly inﬂuences several performance aspects\nsuch as throughput, latency,\
    \ power utilization, delivery ratio, and more. Over the years,\nnumerous algorithms\
    \ and protocols have been suggested for wireless channel access in\ngeneral, and\
    \ WSNs with their speciﬁc characterization in particular. In Section 4, we review\n\
    only a small fraction of the countless MAC protocols that have been designed for\
    \ WSNs.\nWe mainly concentrate on protocols that highlight a conceptual approach\
    \ or trend and\nreview some of the more recent MAC protocols in data gathering\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks,\nwhich address new challenges such as highly dense\
    \ networks, congested channels, and\nvery limited resources.\nWe ascend the protocol\
    \ stack and in Section 5 we address routing aspects. As with the\nMAC sublayer,\
    \ routing protocols in multi-hop wireless networks have also been extensively\n\
    studied. We start by providing several milestones in the context of data gathering\
    \ in\nWSNs. We continue with more recent studies which mainly include enhancements\
    \ to the\naforementioned protocol, taking into account new challenges such as\
    \ scalability demands\nand energy-related advances which present new opportunities\
    \ yet impose new constraints.\nWe continue with studies that leverage the multi-hop\
    \ topology to realize a network-coding\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n4 of 44\nmechanism.\
    \ Finally, we discuss a new paradigm that extends the traditional setup in which\n\
    the sensed data need to be routed toward a static central monitoring station (sink),\
    \ and\nutilize a mobile sink (or sinks) that traverse the terrain and can help\
    \ in collecting the devices’\nreports. We review several state-of-the-art schemes\
    \ in this mobile sink paradigm.\nThe ﬁnal section of this survey is dedicated\
    \ to wearable technology in the form of\nsmart devices that are attached to the\
    \ human body to monitor the user and their envi-\nronment. Wearable technology\
    \ involves challenges in all the aspects discussed in the\nprevious sections,\
    \ yet they introduce new opportunities for high-demand applications with\nunique\
    \ performance requirements and constraints. Even though we do not attempt to\n\
    provide a comprehensive review of the numerous applications suggested over the\
    \ years, we\nemphasize this prominent application layer and discuss several applications\
    \ in Section 6.\nAs previously explained, we roughly partitioned the topics covered\
    \ in this survey\nbased on the communication layers and organized the sections\
    \ accordingly. We note\nthat this partition is somehow artiﬁcial, as many innovations\
    \ in data-gathering involve\nmore than one layer. Furthermore, many technological\
    \ advances and research areas affect\nmultiple domains in different layers and\
    \ are visited in more than one section. Figure 1\ndepicts the schematic structure\
    \ of the paper. In the ﬁgure, the ovals represent the main\nresearch domains covered\
    \ in the paper. The hexagons represent the most prominent\nresearch tool innovations\
    \ and techniques utilized by data-gathering, which are covered in\nthe paper.\
    \ The arrows represent the inter-relation between them. For example, technologies\n\
    such as energy harvesting (EH) or Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    (AI) are utilized by innovations in all the layers starting from the platform\
    \ hardware to\nthe application layer. However, network coding is mainly utilized\
    \ by the network layer.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is leveraged by both the\

    \ Concepts\nOur primary focus in this survey is data gathering in the context\
    \ of wireless commu-\nnication networks. The units that generate the data (typically\
    \ sensors) are application-\ndependent and can serve a large variety of realms,\
    \ e.g., health, environmental, activity\nmonitoring, etc. Even though the sensing\
    \ unit is the essence, we will not cover it thor-\noughly, and we will only skim\
    \ through it sporadically when discussing applications and\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n5 of 44\ntheir speciﬁc requirements. Nonetheless, the term “sensor” typically\
    \ refers to the whole\nplatform or device in which the sensing unit is only one\
    \ component out of many, such as\nprocessing unit, transceiver unit, power unit,\
    \ antenna, and more, several of which can be\nintegrated into the device according\
    \ to the particular application needs. The sensing unit\nitself has its own requirements\
    \ and constraints, and in many situations cannot be altered.\nIn addition, the\
    \ integrated unit architecture and the platform design can be subject to\nvarious\
    \ stringent constraints. For example, size requirements can impose a strict constraint\n\
    on the device design; low power consumption, low production cost, and self-operation\
    \ can\nrepresent additional constraints. Accordingly, the device architecture\
    \ is fundamental and\naffects many other factors in the system. For example, power\
    \ supply affects the life span\n(or the time needed to replace the batteries);\
    \ it also affects transmission range, memory,\nand processing unit, which in turn\
    \ can affect the algorithms that can be executed on the\ndevice, etc.\nExtensive\
    \ research has been conducted on the design and architecture of the end\ndevice\
    \ and the infrastructure. We leave a detailed description of the basic components\
    \ such\nas the sensing unit, transceiver, antenna, processing unit, etc., as well\
    \ as the underlying\nhardware beyond the scope of this survey. To this end, the\
    \ objective of the rest of this section\nrefers to how data-gathering objectives\
    \ may impact both the design of speciﬁc sensors\nand the WSN infrastructure. By\
    \ the latter, we mean topology, system organization used to\ngather the data,\
    \ and algorithms to implement the data gathering. It is noteworthy that the\n\
    sensors’ characteristics also dictate the topology and, consequently, the data\
    \ aggregation\nalgorithms. In the sequel, we mention several platform architecture\
    \ designs as well as\nseveral network-wide architectures, mostly from recent years.\
    \ Additional similar studies\nappear throughout the survey, yet they are organized\
    \ in chapters according to the area in\nwhich they propose the most signiﬁcant\
    \ novelty. Figure 2 presents a schematic description\nof the section. Since several\
    \ papers presented in this section cover more than one topic, and\nsince, as previously\
    \ mentioned, this section is not presumed to provide an exhaustive list\nof all\
    \ papers or topics covered by the scope of WSN architecture, and some of the topics\
    \ are\nnot covered at all or covered by only a few representative papers, the\
    \ description is broad\nand only highlights the main topics covered in the section.\n\

    \ topics covered in the section.\n2.1. Application-Oriented\nMany sensor platforms\
    \ are application-oriented. Occasionally, their suggested ar-\nchitecture can\
    \ be applied to other applications; however, their design and evaluation are\n\
    typically aimed at a speciﬁc one. Hence, in many cases, both hardware and software\n\
    technological developments are introduced for effective functioning. One of the\
    \ most\ncommon tasks of WSN is the obvious one of monitoring a terrain. There\
    \ are many variants\nof WSN monitoring. For example, the requirement can be to\
    \ monitor every point in the\nField of Interest (FoI) vs. monitoring a limited\
    \ number of speciﬁc locations or targets (aka\ntarget coverage) vs. just monitoring\
    \ a border of a region to detect intruders (aka barrier\ncoverage). The coverage\
    \ problem typically involves selecting a subset of sensors that fulﬁll\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n6 of 44\nthe monitoring objective while maintaining network\
    \ connectivity. The sensors’ capabilities\nand the monitoring objective determine\
    \ the network topology.\nWe present several recent examples that mainly concentrate\
    \ on connectivity and data\ngathering under the constraints of the monitoring\
    \ objective. Biswas et al. [25] focus on\nenergy-efﬁcient data gathering in target\
    \ coverage problem, in which an n sensor WSN\nneeds to monitor T speciﬁc targets,\
    \ and there exists a route (multi-hop) from each source to\nthe sink. The paper\
    \ assumes that the source nodes that sense the targets and initiate data\npackets\
    \ into the network are known, and deals with the forwarding of these packets to\n\
    the sink. The paper proposes a distributed data gathering algorithm in which after\
    \ each\nnode discovers its neighbors and their hop-count to the sink, it will\
    \ forward data packets\n(when required) to its neighbor with maximum remaining\
    \ energy and a lower hop count\nto the sink (the remaining energy is assumed to\
    \ be known). Ammari [26] focuses on the\nk-coverage problem in which each point\
    \ in the FoI is required to be covered by at least k\nsensors at any time, and\
    \ each active sensor participating in the monitoring task is required\nto be connected\
    \ to the sink (possibly via a multi-hop route). The paper assumes that the\nsensors\
    \ are heterogeneous (they do not have the same characteristics) and mobile, hence\n\
    the sensors can move toward any region of interest in the deployment ﬁeld to participate\
    \ in\nany deﬁcient k-coverage area and can also act as mobile proxy sinks that\
    \ collect sensed data\nfrom the sensors and deliver them to the sink. Ammari [26]\
    \ partitions the problem into\ntwo problems which are solved sequentially. Namely,\
    \ the mobile k-coverage problem, which\nselects a minimum subset of active sensors\
    \ that solve the k-coverage problem and the data\ngathering problem, and devise\
    \ a forwarding scheme from the active sensors to the sink such\nthat the energy\
    \ consumption due to sensor mobility and communication is minimized.\nMdemaya\
    \ and Bomgni [27] utilize mobile sensors to achieve area coverage. These\nmobile\
    \ sensors can be moved and relocated to cover holes after the random deployment.\n\
    The authors suggest a two-phase approach. According to the ﬁrst one, the monitoring\n\
    area after the initial random deployment is identiﬁed (by the BS), and mobile\
    \ nodes are\nrelocated to cover the monitoring holes detected after the initial\
    \ deployment, trying to\nensure full coverage of the AoI by the static and relocated\
    \ sensors. At the second stage, the\nproposed algorithm schedules the sensors’\
    \ activity (awakening and transmission times)\nthat minimizes the energy consumption\
    \ of the nodes while collecting and sending data\nto the base station. To this\
    \ end, the paper distinguishes between “normal” nodes and\ncluster heads. A survey\
    \ that reviews algorithms and techniques related to the connectivity-\ncoverage\
    \ issues in WSN can be found in Boukerche and Sun [28].\nOccasionally, WSN architectures\
    \ and designs are more application-oriented. For\nexample, Cerchecci et al. [29]\
    \ propose a sensor node topology that uses low-cost and low-\npower components\
    \ for energy-efﬁcient waste management in the context of smart cities.\nThe architecture\
    \ described in [29] suggests a node architecture for measuring the ﬁlling\nlevel\
    \ of trash bins and utilizes LoRa LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) technology\n\
    for real-time data transmission to collect the measured data in a remote data\
    \ collection\ncenter. The design of a sensor node that can detect the presence\
    \ of water on home ﬂoors and\nprovide early warning of water leaks is suggested\
    \ by Teixidó et al. [30]. The paper presents\nand deploys both hardware and software\
    \ of the network components (ﬂood sensing nodes,\nactuator nodes, and a control\
    \ central); communication within the sensor network relies\non the IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. Borrero and Zabalo [31] present a low-cost agriculture-\noriented\
    \ system. The suggested system is based on LoRa technology and can collect various\n\
    measurements, such as humidity, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and temperature,\n\
    and enables a farmer to access all of the information necessary to achieve efﬁcient\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement of crops in real time. The developed wireless sensor\
    \ node has been optimized\nboth in hardware and software and exhibits very low\
    \ power consumption.\n2.2. Energy-Harvesting (EH)\nOne of the main concerns of\
    \ the sensor platform’s design is the source of energy.\nTypically, the energy\
    \ source is a battery attached to the sensor platform. It is utilized to\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n7 of 44\nprovide power to all the required operations, e.g.,\
    \ wireless transmission, computation,\nmemory, etc. The battery properties (e.g.,\
    \ technology used and size) can determine its\nlifespan as well as several other\
    \ properties, e.g., transmission range. In many systems,\nthe battery is a burden,\
    \ as it increases the cost of the system, constrains the platform size,\nand most\
    \ importantly, requires to be replaced occasionally. The challenge of saving power\n\
    spans all the protocol stack; energy considerations show up in each part of this\
    \ survey. As\nwith the other layers, PHY layer innovations have also been suggested\
    \ as to how to utilize\nbattery power efﬁciently.\nAn alternative approach to\
    \ overcome the battery hurdle is to embed a mechanism\nthat harvests energy. Such\
    \ a mechanism can be embedded alongside the battery to ex-\ntend its lifespan,\
    \ or more commonly, it can completely replace the battery so that all the\nfunctions\
    \ rely on it. Batteryless WSNs that rely solely on energy-harvesting (EH)-WSN\n\
    can compromise performance; for example, their transmission range can be shorter,\
    \ the\navailable energy can constrain their awake time, and so on. One of the\
    \ main challenges is to\nlocate the ambient resource from which the energy can\
    \ be harvested. Many studies have ex-\nplored different energy sources that can\
    \ supplement energy, such as solar, vibration, wind,\nmotion, electromagnetic,\
    \ and more. Numerous comprehensive technological overviews\nwith their advantages\
    \ and limitations, energy harvesting modeling, challenge expectations,\nand prospects\
    \ can be found in, for example, Refs. [32–37]. A more recent system design\nreview\
    \ on battery-free and energy-aware WSNs, which utilize ambient energy or wireless\n\
    energy transmission, is given in [38]. It addresses energy supply strategies and\
    \ provides\ninsight into energy management methods and possibilities for energy\
    \ saving at the node\nand network levels.\nKhalid et al. [39] suggest a zero-power\
    \ wireless sensor architecture that consists of\na capacitive sensor (a sensor\
    \ that associates the parameter of interest with the change in\nthe capacitance),\
    \ an RFID chip, a circulator (allows power ﬂow between three deﬁned\nports), and\
    \ an antenna (batteryless). The conceptual idea is that the sensor reﬂects the\n\
    signal received from the RFID, with a change in phase, which is relative to the\
    \ sensed value.\nDesign and implementation of an energetically autonomous WSN\
    \ platform for ambient\nmonitoring in indoor environments are suggested by Abella\
    \ et al. [40]. The proposed self-\npowered autonomous sensor node platform relies\
    \ on embedded photo-voltaic (PV) panels\nto harvest the energy, a microcontroller\
    \ and an RF transceiver with an attached antenna.\nThe suggested architecture\
    \ was prototyped and validated experimentally. Lee et al. [41]\npropose a ﬂoating\
    \ wireless device with energy harvesting capability. The ﬂoating device is\nenergetically\
    \ self-sustaining for extended operational hours. It supports long-range com-\n\
    munication between wireless sensor nodes and a gateway relying on the LoRa technology\n\
    while deployed over a water surface. The ﬂoating device can be used as an environmental\n\
    monitoring station to remotely collect weather and water quality information.\
    \ Ref. [42]\npresent the design of a wireless sensor node, powered by solar energy,\
    \ that collects en-\nvironmental data and can transmit it across vast distances\
    \ (directly to the cloud). The\narchitecture presented therein relies on low-power\
    \ wide-area network (LPWAN) protocols\nthat provide a long-range communication\
    \ system with limited data to transmit and high\nenergy efﬁciency. The authors\
    \ utilize Sigfox technology in their proof-of-concept design.\nAs previously mentioned\
    \ in numerous papers, surveys and tutorials exploring dif-\nferent aspects of\
    \ energy harvesting in WSN exist (a sliver of which we present herein).\nWe will\
    \ revisit EH when we discuss various aspects of data aggregation, such as routing\n\
    enhancement for EH-WSN (under EH constraints), on which we elaborate in Section\
    \ 5.2 or\nwhen discussing wearables in Section 6.\n2.3. Topology\nThroughout the\
    \ survey, the interaction of WSN and IoT will arise in multiple contexts.\nWhile\
    \ this survey mainly deals with data gathering by means of wireless units, an\
    \ IoT unit\npresumes a more high-level entity for localized data gathering. To\
    \ assess the connection\nbetween these two concepts, the reader is advised to\
    \ refer to the most recent work by\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n8 of 44\nDevadas et\
    \ al. [43], for example, where the authors enumerate the IoT data management\n\
    frameworks, challenges and issues. The chapter focuses on three layers of data\
    \ management\nin IoT networks, communication, storage and processing. In addition,\
    \ deployment of IoT\nData management for smart home and smart city is described.\n\
    It is essential to distinguish between a one-directional WSN platform, where sensors\n\
    merely gather the data and activate a speciﬁc infrastructure and set of technologies\
    \ to further\nsend it to a sink, and a bi-directional WSN platform, where the\
    \ sensors are expected to be\nable to act according to control messages received\
    \ from a sink. In the latter case, the sink\nmight be a higher-level entity (e.g.,\
    \ a cloud-based server). While the general data-gathering\ntechniques are usually\
    \ agnostic of the control direction, additional constraints might be\nimposed.\
    \ Delay of the responses, latency, BW usage efﬁciency, security, and privacy are\n\
    some of the demands to consider. Another example of a bi-directional platform\
    \ can be\nseen in social sensor clouds (SSC), which connect a social network with\
    \ a sensor network\nvia a cloud infrastructure. See, for example, Zhu et al. [44],\
    \ which presents a scenario of a\nsmart village and provides discussion on various\
    \ aspects including green planning, energy\nconcerns, and speed of data gathering\
    \ and sharing. In Dinh and Kim [45], an on-demand\nWSN platform is designed. The\
    \ authors suggest a data-gathering protocol that addresses\nbandwidth consumption\
    \ and delivery latency and minimizes the number of requests\nto save resources.\
    \ An infrastructure where sensors form groups belonging to private\nowners constitutes\
    \ a special case. This may be the case in a smart city environment; this\nmeans\
    \ that privacy and/or security considerations should be prioritized. This is the\
    \ topic\naddressed by Zhu et al. [46]. The authors provide a trust-assisted cloud\
    \ for WSN but have\nthroughput issues in mind. Kuo et al. [47] suggest a WSN-based\
    \ IoT platform that provides\na reliable connection between sensors in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the database on the Internet. The\nproposed platform is based on the IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4e time-slotted channel-hopping protocol\nwith resource-constrained devices\
    \ supporting heterogeneous applications. The paper\nsuggests a scheme that compensates\
    \ the clock drift for every timeslot to maintain the clock\nsynchronization required\
    \ for the time-slotted channel-hopping protocol.\nEdge computing, as discussed\
    \ by Satyanarayanan [48], allows distributing the data\ngathering burden across\
    \ multiple cloudlets, which might be highly beneﬁcial for large\nWSN. This platform\
    \ paradigm aims to improve many important aspects: reduced latency\nof data delivery,\
    \ increased bandwidth, scalability, resilience to possible cloud outages,\nand\
    \ privacy control. However, the platform presumes an initial capital investment\
    \ and\nlater maintenance.\nA virtual sensor network was proposed by Abdelwahab\
    \ et al. [49]. Once a user-\ninitiated sensing request is dispatched to a cloud,\
    \ a suitable set of sensors is found for\nthe task. The decision is made according\
    \ to the cost function, which depends on the\nspeciﬁc (e.g., monetary) cost of\
    \ using sensors from the designated set, the beneﬁt that\ncan be received from\
    \ using these sensors, and their effectiveness in distances and delays\n(calculated,\
    \ e.g., in number of hops from sensor to a sink/gateway), also expressed as\n\
    virtual links. The cost might be customized, while a general virtualization problem\
    \ is\nformulated and the algorithm is provided.\nIntegration of unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) and WSN for crop monitoring in\nprecision agriculture is described\
    \ by Popescu et al. [50]. The authors suggest a down-up\nscheme, where the collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level to the\ncluster head\
    \ (CH) level, then collected by the UAV level and ﬁnally delivered to the cloud\n\
    for analysis and possible feedback. Particular emphasis is put on outlying measurements\n\
    from speciﬁc sensors, as they can indicate either a possible sensor failure or\
    \ an upcoming\nunusual event inside the agricultural ﬁeld. The measured data were\
    \ processed through a\nconsensus algorithm. Concurrently, it suppressed outlier\
    \ values left for further examination\nfor the cloud-based analysis. In addition,\
    \ this study focused on the UAV trajectory planning\nto collect the data observed\
    \ by the WSN. Actual deployment with several tens of sensors\nand several CHs\
    \ is provided and analyzed. Note that we dedicate Section 5.4 to data\ngathering\
    \ assisted by a mobile unit.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n9 of 44\nAn implementation\
    \ of a ubiquitous consumer data service for transmitting short mes-\nsages to\
    \ any computing platform is provided by Datta et al. [51]. The authors demonstrate\n\
    a data cycle model that allows any device with sensor(s) to report data encoded\
    \ in short\nmessages. The raw data reaches a central or distributed computing\
    \ platform, where it\nundergoes transformation and evolves into rich and structured\
    \ valuable information for\nhigher-layer applications. The proposed data cycle\
    \ model and DataTweet architecture are\naimed at smart city and large-scale crowd-sensing-based\
    \ IoT scenarios.\n2.4. Application-Oriented Network Architecture\nWe continue\
    \ by covering special types of WSN platforms for data gathering and\nspecialized\
    \ application-driven architecture types. Ayele et al. [52] suggest an IoT network\n\
    architecture for wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) for scenarios in which animals\
    \ exhibit\nsparse mobility, which results in sporadic wireless links. In addition,\
    \ they suggest a\ndata forwarding enhancement that adopts the ﬂood-store-carry-and-forward\
    \ paradigm\nsuggested in the seminal ZebraNet study by Juang et al. [53], in which\
    \ in order to send data\nto the sink, the nodes disseminate it among themselves\
    \ until it reaches the sink. Speciﬁcally,\neach node stores the data needing to\
    \ be conveyed, waits for connectivity with other nodes,\nand distributes the data\
    \ to them, and they repeat the same process. Accordingly, the data is\nspread\
    \ throughout the entire network (i.e., ﬂooding) and will eventually be received\
    \ by the\nsink. The authors in [52] suggest leveraging locally available routing\
    \ parameters to improve\nopportunistic data forwarding algorithms by managing\
    \ the data replication decision.\nSaleh et al. [54] suggest extending the lifetime\
    \ of a wireless sensor network used in\nmobile healthcare applications by increasing\
    \ the number of bits transmitted per symbol, and\nspeciﬁcally to rely on a quaternary\
    \ interconnect scheme in which each transmitted symbol\nmodulates two bits. A\
    \ complementary neural network, static RAM-based architecture is\nsuggested to\
    \ reduce energy consumption in storage and transmissions during the data\ndissemination\
    \ process. A WSN dedicated to home deployment for elderly healthcare and\nearly\
    \ health emergency alarm is discussed by Alsina-Pagès et al. [55]. The authors\
    \ ﬁrst raise\nprivacy concerns related to the monitoring, and accordingly, advocate\
    \ that only sound-\nbased surveillance aimed to merely indicate alarming situations\
    \ is appropriate. In order\nto further conform to the privacy demands, they focus\
    \ on distributed architecture (rather\nthan on a centralized one), where each\
    \ of the WSN sensors sends encrypted identiﬁers of\ntheir measurement. The identiﬁcation\
    \ of events is built on feature extraction. This is done\non the frequency domain\
    \ by ﬁrst dividing the incoming signal into blocks with Hamming\nsliding window,\
    \ then transforming into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier\nTransform\
    \ (DFT) to evaluate the contribution of every band of the spectrum. The ﬁnal\n\
    coefﬁcients are obtained after Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The conclusive\
    \ parts of the\nproposed algorithm classify the coefﬁcients, feeding them into\
    \ Support Vector Machines\nwhich classiﬁes the estimated audio event. The authors\
    \ assert that the classiﬁcation results\ncould be further improved by incorporating\
    \ a deep artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) into\ntheir system.\nIn AbeBer et al.\
    \ [56], a similar method was implemented for urban noise monitoring.\nNamely,\
    \ while STFT was utilized for the noise preprocessing, the classiﬁcation of noise\n\
    levels and events was performed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors\n\
    used several previously published networks; see references therein. Similar methods\
    \ for\nnoise monitoring WSN were introduced by Siamwala et al. [57]. The frequency-domain\n\
    analysis was performed. Then, classiﬁcation by statistical methods was accomplished\n\
    (Gaussian mixture model was used). In addition, the authors in [57] provide an\
    \ elaborate\nWSN architecture, where energy-harvesting solar panels augment the\
    \ sensors’ lifetime and\nthe sensors’ state-of-charge is transmitted and tracked\
    \ by central, more powerful nodes.\n3. Compressed Sensing\nMany data-gathering\
    \ applications rely on numerous self-powered smart devices to\ncollect real-time\
    \ data and convey it via a wireless medium to a central entity or entities\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n10 of 44\n(e.g., the cloud) to further process it and act upon\
    \ it. Such devices are expected to perform\ntwo basic operations—sensing and wireless\
    \ connectivity. Two important hindering aspects\nthat derive from these operations\
    \ inﬂuence the performance and need to be considered\nare: (i) energy consumption\
    \ associated with these two operations, especially when many of\nthese devices\
    \ are typically simple with limited computation abilities and battery lifetime\n\
    (ii) airtime utilization, which can also degrade the performance causing high\
    \ delays, jitter,\nbattery consumption, etc. Accordingly, one of the main challenges\
    \ in combating these\nlimitations is reducing the report payload, which affects\
    \ each report’s transmission time\nand channel utilization. Reducing the payload\
    \ of the sensed data can be accomplished at\ndifferent levels; it can be done\
    \ in the sensing stage by reducing the size of the sensed data, as\nwell as in\
    \ the report preparing stage by compressing the report size, and in the transmission\n\
    stage, by selecting which devices need to send reports, thus limiting redundant\
    \ information.\nWhen the reports need to travel multiple hops before reaching\
    \ their destination, this can\nbe done at the relay stage by pruning, unifying,\
    \ and compressing reports. In the sequel,\nwe discuss Compressed Sensing (CS).\
    \ This novel paradigm can reduce report payload at\nseveral levels mentioned above,\
    \ hence lowering the sensing operation’s transmission time\nand energy consumption.\n\
    Compressed sensing is a signal-processing technique that is most advantageous\
    \ when\nthe subject signal is sparse in some domain, such that a minimal non-zero\
    \ vector of coefﬁ-\ncients can represent it. The signal sparsity enables a high-quality\
    \ reconstruction, which is\nattained by ﬁnding the solution to an under-determined\
    \ linear system of equations with\nthe smallest possible number of non-zero values.\
    \ Thus, a convex minimization problem\nneeds to be solved to perform the recovery.\
    \ Note that the CS technique performs non-\nuniform sampling of the data signal\
    \ with an average sample rate usually smaller than\nthe minimal rate mandated\
    \ by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. A detailed view\nof the technique can\
    \ be found in Balouchestani et al. [58] and Donoho [59]. Various net-\nworking\
    \ domains can utilize compressed sensing, for example, Feizi et al. [60] depict\
    \ some\napplications of CS over networks and elucidate the connection between\
    \ CS and traditional\ninformation-theoretic techniques in source coding and channel\
    \ coding. Particularly, CS is\nhighly suitable for sensed data gathering in wireless\
    \ sensor networks (e.g., physical phe-\nnomena or a scenery), as it can leverage\
    \ the expected high spatial and temporal correlation\nbetween sensing reports\
    \ sent by neighboring sensors at different times in order to acquire\nthe CS paradigm’s\
    \ desired sparsity. In the following, we review several such data-gathering\n\
    schemes that utilize CS.\nLuo et al. [61,62] consider a densely deployed monitoring\
    \ sensor network in which\nreports traverse multiple hops before reaching their\
    \ destination, a sink. These studies\nrely on the concept that sensors’ readings\
    \ are spatially correlated; hence, there exists a\ntransform domain in which the\
    \ sensed signals can be sparsely represented. Both propose\na compressive data-gathering\
    \ (CDG) procedure in which sensors distributively encode\ntheir reports by projecting\
    \ them on a random space basis using random coefﬁcients. These\nencoded reports\
    \ can be decoded at the sink using compressive sensing techniques. Specif-\nically,\
    \ CDG is designed for multi-hop networks where messages need to travel multiple\n\
    hops before reaching their destination. The sampling process that characterizes\
    \ the CS\ncompression process is performed individually at each sensor by simple\
    \ multiplications\nand additions. Particularly, CDG suggests that rather than\
    \ forwarding individual sensor\nreadings, each sensor uses each of its reports\
    \ (measurements) to construct and send M\ndifferent messages, each comprising\
    \ a weighted sum of the sensor’s own report with other\nsensors’ reports traversing\
    \ it (relaying). Formally, denote by vector d = [d1, d2, . . . , dN]T\nthe measurements\
    \ (readings) obtained by all the sensors, where N is the number of nodes in\n\
    the WSN and di denotes the measurement (reading) obtained by sensor si. The sink\
    \ obtains\nM messages (weighted sums) represented by the vector y = Φd = φ1d1,\
    \ φ2d2, . . . , φNdN,\nwhere Φ is an M × N (M << N) matrix comprising the series\
    \ of coefﬁcients generated\nby the sensors, and in particular, φi is the i-th\
    \ column vector of Φ, which denotes the\nrandom coefﬁcients selected by sensor\
    \ i. Luo et al. [61] suggest that the measurement\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n11\
    \ of 44\nmatrix (coefﬁcients matrix) Φ should be a full random matrix with its\
    \ entries being i.i.d.\nGaussian random numbers drawn according to N (0, 1\nM).\
    \ The paper suggests that each\nweighted sum coefﬁcient be chosen pseudo-randomly\
    \ based on each sensor’s ID in order\nto avoid the burden and high overhead required\
    \ to collect these coefﬁcients by the sink\nif they are chosen randomly. Ref.\
    \ [62] extends the random coefﬁcient selection suggested\nin [61] to an only partly\
    \ random matrix in which the entries of a sub-matrix are still drawn\naccording\
    \ to N (0, 1\nM). Yet, for the rest of the matrix, two options are suggested,\
    \ either an\nupper triangular matrix with non-zero entries drawn according to\
    \ N (0, 1\nM), or the identity\nmatrix. CDG exploits the compressive sampling\
    \ theory and shows that when the sensor\nreadings are compressible, the sink will\
    \ be able to accurately recover the reports even when\nthe number of weighted\
    \ sums (messages) each sensor generates for each report (M) is\nmuch lower than\
    \ the number of reporting sensors (N). For example, on a route comprising\nN sensors,\
    \ the sink needs to collect only M << N messages to encode the information sent\n\
    by all the N sensors.\nSeveral studies further explore the sparsity of the sensed\
    \ signal and its projection\nmatrix, as well as the number of messages (M) that\
    \ should be delivered to the sink. For\nexample, Wang et al. [63] argue that most\
    \ natural signals are nonstationary and ordinarily\nvariable in the temporal and\
    \ spatial domains. In CS, these directly inﬂuence the recon-\nstruction process\
    \ and the number of required measurements; consequently, setting a ﬁxed\nnumber\
    \ of measurements with a ﬁxed transform basis (coefﬁcient matrix Φ) can result\n\
    in poor performance (inaccurate measurement reconstruction). Accordingly, Ref.\
    \ [63]\nsuggests an adaptive data-gathering scheme based on CS, which utilizes\
    \ an autoregressive\n(AR) model to exploit the local spatial correlation between\
    \ sensed data of neighboring\nsensor nodes. The suggested reconstruction scheme\
    \ adapts to the variation of sensed data\nby adjusting the AR parameters. The\
    \ number of measurements is adjusted adaptively\nwith the sensed data by evaluating\
    \ the recovery result and approximating the number of\nmeasurements required to\
    \ satisfy the accuracy demand.\nTo reduce the transmission overhead, Xu et al.\
    \ [64] propose the compressed sparse\nfunction (CSF) scheme. The basic concept\
    \ of CSF is, rather than encode the sensed data\nby projecting it on a basis on\
    \ which it can be represented sparsely, as in typical CS-based\nschemes, to compress\
    \ the sensed data in the form of sparse functions, which are sent to the\nsource.\
    \ The source can recover the function using techniques from polynomial approxi-\n\
    mation/interpolation theory and use them to compute data values that were not\
    \ reported.\nSpeciﬁcally, CSF ﬁnds a function that maps the sensors’ identiﬁers\
    \ and their readings, which\ncan be expressed in a very sparse way, and only communicates\
    \ this function to the sink.\nAfter the sink recovers the function, it can recover\
    \ all the N sensor readings. Xu et al. [64]\nshow that the CSF approach can provide\
    \ good recovery accuracy (better than the CDG\nscheme suggested by [61]) while\
    \ substantially reducing the message overhead (mainly in\ntree-structured networks).\
    \ Li et al. [65] present a general CS framework for WSNs and IoT\nand show how\
    \ the proposed framework can be utilized to reconstruct the compressible\ninformation.\
    \ The suggested framework comprises three phases: (i) information sensing\nto\
    \ detect and compressively sample event signals; (ii) compressed sampling, in\
    \ which the\nsystem samples information traversing the networks; and (iii) reconstruction\
    \ algorithms, in\nwhich the system accurately reconstructs the original signal\
    \ from the compressed samples.\nDifferent studies tackle the sampling issue and\
    \ suggest different approaches to reduce\nthe number of reports sent such that\
    \ only a subset of the sensors sense the object or\nphenomenon at a time. Several\
    \ studies explore how sensed data is conveyed to the sink\nwith the insight that\
    \ the compression is at least attained along the path to the sink, and is\ntherefore\
    \ affected by it. For example, Dhanapala et al. [66] show that a random-walk-based\n\
    sampling, rather than the conventional uniform-sampling-based CS for function\
    \ recovery,\ncan be used for phenomena awareness either at a sink or at other\
    \ sensors without a sink,\nwith minimal additional sampling. As the distribution\
    \ of the samples has a signiﬁcant effect\non the recovery, Ref. [66] suggests\
    \ an upper bound for the probability of successful recovery\nwith a given error\
    \ percentage. The derived bound provides an approximate number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n12 of 44\nsamples required to recover a function under a selected\
    \ basis and a sampling scheme.\nZheng et al. [67] further argue that random walk\
    \ provides a more practical approach for\nthe data-gathering application in WSNs\
    \ and explores the sparsity of collecting non-uniform\nmeasurements while sampling\
    \ along multiple random paths. The paper suggests that\nthe M × N measurement\
    \ matrix will be characterized by M independent random walks.\nSpeciﬁcally, each\
    \ of the M matrix rows corresponds to the set of vertices visited by the\nrespective\
    \ random walk. The paper analyzes the required number of random walks (M)\nand\
    \ their corresponding lengths (how many entries on each row are non-zero) under\
    \ the\nproposed random walk algorithm.\nZheng et al. [68] suggest a cluster-based\
    \ data-gathering mechanism, in which the\nterrain is divided into cells; in each\
    \ cell, a node is randomly selected as the cell head,\nwhich collects the data\
    \ from the cell members and forwards it to the sink. Zheng et al. [68]\nsuggest\
    \ two forwarding mechanisms, one relying on centrally deﬁned tree-based for-\n\
    warding, and another that is a gossip-based approach. The projection process is\
    \ similar\nto Luo et al. [61,62], being based on random coefﬁcients. Another clustering-based\
    \ hi-\nerarchical data aggregation protocol that relies on CS, termed HDACS, is\
    \ suggested by\nXu et al. [69]. Speciﬁcally, HDACS constructs a multilevel hierarchical\
    \ structure and adap-\ntively sets multiple compression thresholds based on cluster\
    \ sizes at different levels of the\ndata aggregation tree to optimize the amount\
    \ of transmitted data. The encoding procedure\nis adapted from [62], where each\
    \ cluster-head recovers (decodes) all received messages\nfrom its descendants\
    \ (retrieves the original data) before compressing and sending it to its\nparent\
    \ cluster-head.\nMotivated by reducing power consumption, Lan and Wei [70] also\
    \ suggest a\ncompressibility-based clustering algorithm for hierarchical compressive\
    \ data gathering. In\nthis study, the network is decomposed into a logical chain,\
    \ and sensor nodes are grouped\nbased on the compressibility of their readings\
    \ instead of by a random clustering approach.\nThis clustering approach strives\
    \ to minimize the average compression ratio of all clusters by\ngreedily selecting\
    \ the set of nodes based on the compression ratio. It then tries to maximize\n\
    the number of compressible clusters so as to determine the suitable transmission\
    \ mode\nfor each cluster using a mode threshold that is a function of the number\
    \ of nodes and the\nnumber of hops from a cluster-head to a sink.\nTo reduce the\
    \ number of sensors involved in each CS measurement, Wu et al. [71]\npropose a\
    \ sparsest random scheduling scheme for compressive data gathering in large-\n\
    scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), leveraging the spatial-temporal properties\
    \ in the\nsensory data. The central theme of this study is that the measurement\
    \ matrix is designed\nbased on the representation basis and sensory data and according\
    \ to the sensor network\nrequirements rather than the network environment. By\
    \ combining compressed sensing\nand network coding in the data-gathering scheme,\
    \ Yin et al. [72] introduce a multi-hop\ntopology in which the sink node adaptively\
    \ adjusts the measurement formation according\nto the reconstruction of received\
    \ measurements at each data-gathering epoch. The sink\nnode dictates the data\
    \ aggregation performed to balance the energy consumption among\nsensor nodes.\n\
    Xu et al. [73] exploit the CS paradigm for network tomography. Speciﬁcally, Ref.\
    \ [73]\nleverages the fact that, typically, only a small fraction of network entities\
    \ such as links or\nnodes are responsible for anomalies or degradation in network\
    \ performance, as a limited\nnumber of congested links can be responsible for\
    \ signiﬁcant delays or high packet drop\nrates, and suggests utilizing CS theory\
    \ in order to identify these few entities based on end-\nto-end measurements.\
    \ Zheng et al. [74] provide an analysis of the capacity and delay of\ndata gathering\
    \ with compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks. The paper considers\n\
    a random topology where sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region, for both\n\
    single-sink and multi-sink scenarios, and characterizes the capacity and delay\
    \ performance\nimprovement that the CS paradigm can achieve for data gathering.\
    \ In particular, for\nthe single sink, a simple routing scheme for data gathering\
    \ with CS is suggested, and\na tight capacity in the order sense is presented.\
    \ In particular, the suggested routing\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n13 of 44\nscheme\
    \ with pipelining scheduling algorithm for data gathering shows that the proposed\n\
    single-sink scheme can achieve a capacity gain of Θ( n\nM) over the baseline transmission\n\
    scheme, and the delay can be reduced by a factor of Θ(\n√\nnlogn\nM\n), where\
    \ M is the number\nof random projections required for reconstructing a snapshot,\
    \ and n is the number of\nrandomly deployed nodes. For the multi-sink case, their\
    \ architecture shows that the per-\nsession capacity of data gathering with CS\
    \ is Θ(\nn√nW\nMnd\n√\nnslogn), and the per-session delay is\nΘ(M\nq\nn\nlogn),\
    \ where W is the data rate. The number of sinks present in the network is nd,\n\
    and the number of randomly selected source nodes is ns. They validate the theoretical\n\
    results with simulations for the scaling laws of the capacity in both single-sink\
    \ and multi-\nsink networks.\n4. Medium Access Control (MAC)\nNext, we move to\
    \ the Data-Link layer and speciﬁcally to the medium access control\n(MAC) mechanism,\
    \ which highly affects the performance of data gathering protocols, as\nit inﬂuences\
    \ several performance aspects, such as reliability, latency, channel utilization,\n\
    power utilization (which impact the lifespan of a sensor in particular and the\
    \ network in\ngeneral), etc. Even though many access protocols were suggested\
    \ over the years for shared-\nchannel networks, wired and wireless, due to their\
    \ unique properties and requirements,\nextensive research has been conducted on\
    \ MAC protocols targeted to WSN. Many WSN\nMAC protocols were designed to comply\
    \ with various trafﬁc patterns. Accordingly, in the\nsequel, we provide a short\
    \ WSN-MAC protocol overview for ones that can support yet\nare not necessarily\
    \ particular to data-gathering. We review a fraction of the vast literature\n\
    on the topic and the numerous MAC protocols devised over the years. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ a\nschematic partition of the papers discussed throughout this section according\
    \ to the main\nMAC classes.\nMAC\nSection 4\nSynchronous \nTransmitter-Initiated\
    \ \nReceiver-Initiated \nAsynchronous \nOthers\nSection 4.2\nDuty-Cycle\nSection\
    \ 4.1\nFigure 3. Schematic description highlighting the main MAC classes covered\
    \ in the section.\nEnergy consumption is one of the main concerns of WSN, and\
    \ as previously explained,\nit needs to be considered in the design of protocols\
    \ and algorithms in all the layers of the\nprotocol stack. The highest energy\
    \ consumer of a sensor or an IoT device is its transceiver,\nwhich consumes energy\
    \ regardless of whether it is transmitting or only awake listening to\nongoing\
    \ trafﬁc (e.g., [75]). One of the more prevalent solutions to save power is to\
    \ embrace\na duty-cycle mechanism in which the device is asleep most of the time\
    \ (its transceiver is in\nlow power mode), and is awake for transmitting or receiving\
    \ data only a small fraction\nof the time. Another important aspect of wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSN) is channel\nutilization, that is, in a typical WSN, when\
    \ multiple devices are trying to send reports\nsimultaneously, air time is a crucial\
    \ network resource. Particularly when the network is\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    14 of 44\ndense with multiple devices in the same neighborhood, issues such as\
    \ coordinating between\nthe users to avoid collisions and preventing users from\
    \ occupying the channel for long\ntime intervals are fundamental. Note that such\
    \ issues can highly affect the performance in\na dense network topology even when\
    \ reports are not frequent. Accordingly, utilizing the\nchannel (air time) efﬁciently\
    \ is a crucial component for any such system’s operation and\nperformance. These\
    \ two highly vital aspects justify the signiﬁcance given to the design of\nmedium\
    \ access control (MAC) protocols that are particular to WSNs. Numerous protocols\n\
    have been suggested to cope with different WSN objectives and demands (e.g., [76,77]).\n\
    This paper focuses on MAC protocols for WSNs, particularly on duty-cycled-based\
    \ ones.\n4.1. Duty-Cycle MAC Protocols\nTraditionally, duty-cycle MAC protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed as either synchronous or\nasynchronous. In synchronous protocols\
    \ the awake time interval is synchronized such that\nall devices are awake (or\
    \ asleep) at the same time intervals (e.g., S-MAC [78], T-MAC [79]).\nSince the\
    \ awake time intervals are quite limited, they can be highly congested and prone\n\
    to collisions. Several synchronous protocols have devised mechanisms to attenuate\
    \ this\ncongestion and to allow more devices to transmit in each cycle, for example,\
    \ DW-MAC [80],\nwhich allocates the awake time for transmission reservations that\
    \ will be executed during\nthe sleep interval.\nIn asynchronous protocols, each\
    \ device has its own wake-up schedule. Accordingly,\nthe main challenge is setting\
    \ a rendezvous time when both the sender and the receiver are\nawake and devising\
    \ a signaling mechanism that informs both that they are awake and can\ncommunicate.\
    \ Asynchronous MAC protocols can further be divided into two categories,\ntransmitter-\
    \ or receiver-initiated. In transmitter-initiated protocols, the transmitter initiates\n\
    the transmission by capturing the channel waiting for its designated receiver\
    \ to wake\nup. For instance, in B-MAC [81], the transmitter transmits a long preamble\
    \ capturing the\nchannel prior to the data transmission, waiting for its intended\
    \ receiver to wake up and\nreply. In X-MAC [82], the transmitter transmits a sequence\
    \ of short preambles allowing\nthe intended receiver to interrupt, notifying the\
    \ receiver that it is awake. In WiseMAC [83],\nthe transmitter learns the wake-up\
    \ time of its intended receiver and starts the preamble\ntransmission just prior\
    \ to this wake-up time.\nThe second approach, the receiver-initiated paradigm,\
    \ relies on the receiver, whenever\nawake and ready to receive data, to initiate\
    \ the data exchange. The basic receiver-initiated\nMAC concept was introduced\
    \ in RI-MAC [84], in which whenever the receiver wakes up,\nit transmits a predeﬁned\
    \ preamble, signaling to its potential transmitters that it is awake\nand ready\
    \ to receive data. Several protocols took up the RI-MAC paradigm and suggested\n\
    modiﬁcations and enhancements. Some protocols strived to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    while a sender stays awake, waiting for its intended receiver to wake up. For\
    \ instance,\nPW-MAC [85] and AP-MAC [86] suggested that each transmitter will\
    \ learn its receiver’s\nexpected wake-up time, and instead of staying awake waiting\
    \ for its designated receiver to\nwake up, will wake up just before its intended\
    \ receiver’s wake-up instance.\nAnother receiver-initiated enhancement is suggested\
    \ by A-MAC [87], which aims to\nreduce the time in which a receiver and, consequently,\
    \ its potential transmitters stay awake,\nby trying to determine whether there\
    \ are pending packets for transmission and if it needs\nto stay awake or if it\
    \ can go back to sleep after probing the channel. The enhancement\nrelies on an\
    \ additional frame, termed “auto-ack”, sent by pending transmitters, which\nfollows\
    \ the receiver’s probe packet and proceeds with the data transmission. The “auto-ack”\n\
    frame is such that the receiver can decode a superposition of several such frames\
    \ and\ndetermine whether there is trafﬁc being sent. Even though the energy saved\
    \ per cycle is\nnegligible, the cumulative savings per day can be signiﬁcant due\
    \ to the numerous times\na device wakes up probing the channel. RIVER-MAC [88]\
    \ suggests two enhancements,\none aiming at reducing the awake time a sender is\
    \ waiting for its intended receiver to\nwake up, and one that aims at improving\
    \ the RI-MAC collision resolution mechanism by\nletting an active receiver keep\
    \ controlling the channel after invoking the collision resolution\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n15 of 44\nmechanism, and speciﬁcally during the silent backoff interval.\
    \ MAR-RiMAC [89] suggested\nan amendment to the receiver-initiated approach, and\
    \ in particular RI-MAC, to cope with\nthe perpetual collisions, common in dense\
    \ networks and heavy trafﬁc loads, in which\nmany devices are trying to transmit\
    \ to the same entity (sink or relay). MAR-RiMAC relies\non a reservation-based\
    \ mechanism in which the reservations are short signals that can\nbe transmitted\
    \ simultaneously. After the designated receiver decodes the identity of the\n\
    devices, it sends a transmission request and polls them sequentially, with no\
    \ idle intervals.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, relying on EH requires adaptations\
    \ that typically relate\nto the harvested energy source. For example, how to balance\
    \ the harvested energy and\nthe energy consumption can be a crucial factor in\
    \ whether or not a scheme or protocol\ncan be adopted by a network that relies\
    \ on EH, and can be the primary factor impacting\ntheir performance. Adaptation\
    \ requirements to support EH-based sensors span the whole\nnetwork stack, including\
    \ the MAC sublayer. Adaptation of receiver-initiated duty-cycle\nMAC protocol\
    \ for energy-harvesting-powered wireless sensor networks, in which besides\nthe\
    \ usual MAC challenges, both transmitter and receiver need to have sufﬁcient power\
    \ for\nsuccessful transmission, is given by Liu et al. [90].\n4.2. MAC Protocols\
    \ for Other Setups\nNext, we review some MAC protocols and MAC adaptations for\
    \ various setups,\nsuch as multi-channel, multi-radio, busy-tone utilization,\
    \ or different from the duty-cycle\napproach. DURI-MAC [91] adopts the traditional\
    \ busy-tone scheme and allocates a sub-\nchannel for control such that while receiving\
    \ data on the data channel, a busy signal\nis transmitted on the control channel,\
    \ which notiﬁes neighboring nodes of the ongoing\ntransmission, and therefore\
    \ helps avoid interference from hidden terminals. EM-MAC [92]\nutilizes multiple\
    \ orthogonal radio channels and allows devices to dynamically select the\nchannels\
    \ for their transmissions based on the channel conditions they sense without the\n\
    utilization of a control channel. Accordingly, EM-MAC can avoid using channels\
    \ that are\ncurrently heavily loaded, inferior due to interference, or jammed.\
    \ Typically, the trafﬁc\nload sent by a node is spatially and temporally variable.\
    \ Different nodes need to send\ndifferent trafﬁc loads due to their tasks, topological\
    \ location, and the amount of trafﬁc they\nneed to relay. Furthermore, the same\
    \ node can experience different loads at different time\nintervals due to events\
    \ or requests triggering different trafﬁc loads. Accordingly, several\nstudies\
    \ have explored an adaptive duty-cycle approach. For example, Ye and Zhang [93]\n\
    have developed a reinforcement-learning-based self-adaptive sleep/wake-up scheduling\n\
    approach. In the proposed method, each node (device) divides the time into time-slots,\n\
    which are not necessarily synchronized between neighboring nodes. Each node decides\n\
    whether to sleep or wake up in each time slot, and while awake, it decides whether\
    \ to listen\nor transmit. The decision is based on its current situation and its\
    \ estimation of its neighbors’\nsituations and is attained via Q-learning.\nGamm\
    \ et al. [94] devise an alternative approach to duty-cycle, which utilizes two\n\
    radios: the primary radio transceiver and an additional wake-up radio (WuR). The\
    \ wake-up\nradio is a low-power receiver triggered by an external event and can\
    \ turn on the main\ntransceiver when required. Oller et al. [95] provide a detailed\
    \ characterization of a speciﬁc\nWuR, the SubCarrier Modulation WuR (SCM-WuR),\
    \ through physical experiments and\nmeasurements, evaluating it for different\
    \ performance metrics and comparing it to other\nwake-up radio-based systems.\
    \ The authors of [95] model and simulate their own designed\nWuR hardware platform,\
    \ which is compared to four widely employed MAC protocols for\nWSN under three\
    \ real-world network deployments [96]. Spenza et al. [97] further design\nand\
    \ prototype a very-low-power-consumption (<1.3 µW), high-sensitivity (up to −55\
    \ dBm),\nfast-reactivity (wake-up time of 130 µs), and selective-addressing wake-up\
    \ receiver (WRx)\nand describe its integration to a wireless sensor node. The\
    \ authors leverage their WRx and\npresent ALBA-WUR, a cross-layer solution for\
    \ data gathering in wireless sensing systems.\nSimilar to duty-cycled MAC protocols,\
    \ wake-up radio-based protocols also distinguish\nbetween transmitter-initiated\
    \ WuR (TI-WuR) protocols in which the transmitter wakes up\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n16 of 44\nits potential receivers (e.g., [98,99]) vs. receiver-initiated\
    \ WuR (RI-WuR) that adopt the\nRI-MAC paradigm such that when a receiving node\
    \ is ready to collect data, it wakes up all\nthe nodes in its neighborhood by\
    \ broadcasting a wake-up call (e.g., [100,101]).\nAn energy-harvesting-based MAC\
    \ protocol for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is\nsuggested by Hawa et al. [102],\
    \ in which the secondary users (SUs) utilize the transmis-\nsions by primary users\
    \ (PUs) to harvest energy. Accordingly, the suggested protocol\ninterlaces SUs’\
    \ data transmissions within these PUs’ transmission holes. The proposed\nenergy-harvesting/data-transmission\
    \ schedule considers the imbalance between the small\namount of energy collected\
    \ per PU’s transmission and the energy required by an SU\ndata transmission.\n\
    Next, we mention several WSN MAC protocols that were specially designed for\n\
    particular data-gathering setups in WSN and IoT networks, exploiting the special\
    \ associ-\nated attributes (e.g., that the trafﬁc patterns are always from sensors\
    \ to the sink, or that\nthere exists a set of predeﬁned messages that need to\
    \ be sent). Cohen et al. [103] design\nand analyze a data collection protocol\
    \ based on information theoretic principles. In the\nsuggested protocol, each\
    \ sensor needs to convey one out of a bank of known messages\nto a sink. The protocol\
    \ assumes a large population of sensors and devises a scheme in\nwhich a sink\
    \ (or relay) can simultaneously collect messages from up to K sensors, without\n\
    knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchroniza-\n\
    tion, coordination, or management overhead. D-3 [104] exploits the fact that the\
    \ trafﬁc in\ndata-gathering applications ﬂows in a certain direction (toward a\
    \ single or multiple sinks)\nto devise a wake-up that can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ end-to-end delay. Speciﬁcally, D-3 lays\nout the awake schedule of communicating\
    \ nodes such that a packet can be forwarded\ntoward its destination sequentially,\
    \ without the need for a node to wait for its next-hop\nrelay to wake up (i.e.,\
    \ the wake-up schedule is such that a relay wakes up in time to receive\na packet\
    \ just received by its predecessor).\n5. Routing for Data Gathering in WSN\nWe\
    \ keep climbing the layers, and in this section we address issues related to the\n\
    Network layer. We start with a short review of WSN routing protocols. We note\
    \ that\nrouting-related aspects were also referred to in other sections of this\
    \ survey. We mainly\nfocus on the prominent and more recent protocols. We do not\
    \ provide a comprehensive\nreview of routing protocols in multihop WSNs and mainly\
    \ explore routing protocols\nsuitable for data gathering. Figure 4 provides a\
    \ schematic distribution of the discussed\npapers into main topics. As with the\
    \ schematic partition in the other sections, in order\nnot to have too many, the\
    \ topics are chosen such that the theme on each one encompasses\nseveral papers.\
    \ The papers’ partition is rough: some papers can appear in more than one\ntopic\
    \ while others are only related to the topic.\nWe start with general WSN settings\
    \ and then continue with routing protocols under\nenergy harvesting constraints.\
    \ Then we explore the utilization of network coding for data\ngathering, which\
    \ leverages the multi-hop routing, allowing relays (intermediate nodes)\nto code\
    \ the incoming packets before forwarding them toward the sink. We conclude this\n\
    section by examining a different paradigm. Rather than utilizing the traditional\
    \ approach of\nforwarding the sensed data via multiple relay nodes before reaching\
    \ the sink, this paradigm\nrelies on a Mobile Sink (MS) that traverses the network\
    \ and collects the sensed data from\nthe sensors it passes through.\n5.1. Common\
    \ WSN Routing Protocols for Data Gathering\nThe common setup for a data collection\
    \ network comprises a set of devices (e.g.,\nsensors) and one or multiple sinks\
    \ that collect the reports. In many such scenarios, the\nsensors are unevenly\
    \ dispersed over the terrain and in some cases can be mobile, can have\na different\
    \ distance to the sink(s), and the data needs to traverse multiple hops before\n\
    reaching the sink, in which commonly the sensors themselves serve as relays toward\n\
    the sink. Consequently, the performance experienced by different sensors (e.g.,\
    \ energy\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n17 of 44\nconsumption, latency, reliability)\
    \ can be markedly diverse. Various solutions, including\nenergy-aware routing,\
    \ compressed sensing, efﬁcient MAC novelties and architectural\ninnovations, have\
    \ been suggested to try to improve the overall performance and to balance\nits\
    \ variability; many are scattered throughout this survey under different subjects\
    \ (e.g.,\nSections 3, 4 and 6). In the sequel, we provide a brief review of routing\
    \ protocols for WSN\nin general and data gathering in particular.\nRouting\nSection\

    \ Cluster-Based Routing Protocols\nA signiﬁcant milestone in WSN routing protocols\
    \ is the low-energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy (LEACH) protocol [105]. The\
    \ basic LEACH protocol is an adaptive clustering-\nbased protocol that dynamically\
    \ selects sensor nodes as cluster-heads. Each cluster-head\naggregates data from\
    \ its cluster members and relays it to the sink. In order to distribute\nthe high\
    \ energy consumption imposed on cluster-heads between all the sensor nodes,\n\
    the cluster-heads are dynamically selected according to a predeﬁned probability\
    \ that\ndepends on the number of desired clusters. The resulting protocol causes\
    \ continuous\nclustering hierarchy reelection, which facilitates energy balancing.\
    \ The original version\npresented by Heinzelman et al. [105] considers a setup\
    \ in which all sensor nodes can\ndirectly communicate with the sink; hence, each\
    \ cluster-head can directly relay the collected\ninformation from its cluster\
    \ members to the sink. However, as described in the paper,\nLEACH can be easily\
    \ extended to a hierarchical cluster setup in which the cluster-head\nnodes of\
    \ each tier are also organized in clusters such that each cluster-head relays\
    \ its\naggregated data to its higher-layer cluster-head, and so on up to the top\
    \ layer of the\nhierarchy, at which point the data are sent to the sink.\nSince\
    \ its publication in 2000, numerous protocols have relied on LEACH’s clustering\n\
    paradigm, suggesting enhancements and improvements for various setups and require-\n\
    ments. For instance, EE-LEACH [106,107] aims at improving the energy efﬁciency\
    \ of\nLEACH by considering the sensor’s residual energy throughout the stages\
    \ of the proto-\ncol. Speciﬁcally, EE-LEACH assumes that node deployment is implemented\
    \ according\nto a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. It forms clusters and\
    \ selects their respective\ncluster-heads based on the residual energy of neighboring\
    \ nodes. The relay nodes that\nforward the data aggregated by cluster-heads to\
    \ the sink are selected based on their residual\nenergy. A clustering procedure\
    \ based on recursive rectangular partitioning of the network\ngrid following the\
    \ k-d tree algorithm is demonstrated by Anzola et al. [108]. The authors\nadjust\
    \ a protocol that combines their clustering methods and report that it performs\
    \ better\nthan LEACH. Several surveys have summarized the successors of the LEACH\
    \ protocol\n(e.g., [107]).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n18 of 44\nPEGASIS [109] was\
    \ designed to address the overhead resulting from the cluster\nformation in LEACH.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, PEGASIS replaces the clusters with a node-chain in which\neach\
    \ node receives the data from its predecessor and transmits it to its successor\
    \ in the chain.\nThe data is gathered while getting fused along the chain until\
    \ eventually, a designated\nnode transmits it to the sink. PEGASIS relies on nodes\
    \ having global knowledge of the\nnetwork and shows that a simple greedy algorithm\
    \ for the forwarding chain construction,\nin which nodes select their closest\
    \ neighbors as the next hops in the chain, is sufﬁcient to\nsigniﬁcantly reduce\
    \ energy consumption. Similar to LEACH, and in order to balance the\nenergy depletion\
    \ in the network, different nodes transmit the fused data to the sink on\neach\
    \ data-gathering round. P-LEACH [110] offers a hybrid between LEACH and PEGASIS\n\
    that relies on cluster formation where cluster-heads collect and forward trafﬁc.\
    \ Rather\nthan forward the trafﬁc directly to the sink, or create a hierarchical\
    \ cluster setup in which\ncluster-heads are also grouped into clusters with another\
    \ cluster-head, P-LEACH adopts\nchain-based forwarding such that the cluster-heads\
    \ are arranged in a chain along which\nthe collected data is forwarded, as suggested\
    \ by PEGASIS.\nSeveral LEACH enhancements have relied on bio-inspired algorithms.\
    \ For example,\nSiew et al. [111] utilize adaptive particle swarm optimization\
    \ (APSO). This widely used\nswarm intelligence method mimics swarming behavior\
    \ in bird ﬂocking and ﬁsh schooling\nto guide its members to search for globally\
    \ optimal solutions for cluster-head location\nselection. Tam et al. [112] extend\
    \ LEACH to a 3D setting by employing a method based on\nfuzzy clustering and particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO). Cui et al. [113] suggest a variant\nof the bat algorithm,\
    \ which simulates bat prey echolocation behavior, to optimize the\ncluster-head\
    \ selection for LEACH protocol. A routing path selection using an ant colony\n\
    optimization algorithm is presented by Jiang and Zheng [114]. Clustering by mimicking\n\
    groups of yellow goatﬁsh is discussed by Rodríguez et al. [115]. The authors claim\
    \ that\nthe presented meta-heuristic is more efﬁcient in avoiding local minima.\
    \ An extension of\nLEACH for an IoT-designated industrial environment is presented\
    \ by Karunanithy and\nVelusamy [116]. This work provides uniform CH selection,\
    \ uniform CH dispersion over\nthe industrial grid of IoT-based sensors, and tree-based\
    \ routing selection that promises to\nbe more energy efﬁcient than known counterparts.\
    \ The energy exploitation is claimed to be\nequal among nodes.\nMehmood et al.\
    \ [117] devise a dynamic-size cluster-based routing protocol for WSN\ncomprising\
    \ a large number of sensors that are spread over a large area (the paper suggests\n\
    pollution monitoring as a candidate application). The primary objective of the\
    \ presented\nscheme is to effectively select CHs to be responsible for the main\
    \ communication with BS\nand additionally deﬁned chief nodes (CNs). Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the sensor topology is divided\ninto groups, where CNs collect the updated energy\
    \ indications of other sensors within a\ngroup. There are also border nodes responsible\
    \ for communication between groups. If\ntheir energy value drops below a threshold,\
    \ the CNs can be reelected. The candidates for\nCNs and CHs are provided by an\
    \ artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which takes as inputs\nremaining energy, neighboring\
    \ node count, the amount of outstanding data, signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR), distances\
    \ between nodes, CHs, CNs and the BS, trafﬁc load, and so\non. The simulations\
    \ show a better lifetime than other selected known protocols; hence,\nthe scheme\
    \ is a better ﬁt for pollution monitoring. Clustering and routing for a wind\n\
    turbine system monitored by WSN are introduced by Durairaj and Selvaraj [118].\
    \ The\ndiscussed environment is unique because sensors placed at wind turbines\
    \ can have their\nenergy replenished by the turbine itself; hence, these sensors\
    \ are always assumed to be\ncharged. However, the distances between turbines and\
    \ the BS are too large, and the\ngrid is augmented by ground sensors that relay\
    \ the measurements. In many cases, these\nground sensors have to act as CHs. The\
    \ authors propose system partitioning and clustering\nmethods that may be hierarchical\
    \ to speciﬁcally address this scenario. An interesting\nalgorithm that also employs\
    \ partitioning, by hierarchical grouping of sensors based on\nearly knowledge\
    \ of geographical transmission patterns in mobile WSN, is presented by\nShifrin\
    \ and Cidon [119].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n19 of 44\n5.1.2. Opportunistic Routing\n\
    The opportunistic routing approach, which was designed for wireless networks,\
    \ dy-\nnamically chooses paths toward the destination on a per-transmission basis,\
    \ Biswas and\nMorris [120], Ye and Hua [121]. Opportunistic routing exploits the\
    \ broadcast nature of\nwireless communication jointly with the spatial diversity\
    \ of distributed nodes in a given\nroute such that multiple nodes overhear each\
    \ packet transmitted by a node. The node that\nreceives the packet successfully\
    \ and can serve as the best relay toward the destination (e.g.,\nclosest to the\
    \ destination) becomes the next transmitting node. Harnessing opportunistic\n\
    routing to duty-cycle MAC protocols encounters several obstacles. In synchronous\
    \ duty-\ncycle MAC protocols (Section 4), the short time duration in which all\
    \ nodes are awake (and\nspeciﬁcally, all the potential relays are awake and trying\
    \ to forward the same packet) can\nlead to artiﬁcial congestion and poor wake-time\
    \ utilization. In asynchronous duty-cycle\nMAC protocols, since not all nodes\
    \ are awake simultaneously, the use of overhearing, which\nopportunistic routing\
    \ relies on, is limited and requires adaptations such that the transmitter\nwill\
    \ transmit to multiple relays upon its wake-up (e.g., [122]) or delay its transmission,\n\
    choosing its relay opportunistically based on channel condition (e.g., [123]).\n\
    In a dense WSN, even under asynchronous duty-cycle MAC protocol, several potential\n\
    relays can be awake simultaneously, which poses additional challenges when utilizing\n\
    opportunistic routing. In addition to the relay selection problem—whether a transmitter\n\
    should wait for the best relay to wake up or compromise on a less preferable relay,\
    \ reducing\nits awake period and how long it should wait—it also encounters the\
    \ collision avoidance\nproblem between simultaneously awake nodes. Liu et al.\
    \ [124] suggest a slotted contention-\nbased scheme in which, following a probe\
    \ sent by the transmitter, the awakened potential\nrelays contend and transmit\
    \ feedback concerning the routing progress they can offer. The\ntransmitter selects\
    \ the best possible relay out of the ones that replied, taking into account\n\
    not only the metric chosen to evaluate the different relays, but also the waiting\
    \ time of\nthe link-layer transmissions. Under a similar set-up of dense asynchronous\
    \ duty-cycle\nMAC protocol with multiple potential relays awake simultaneously,\
    \ Hawbani et al. [125]\ntry to control the number of potential forwarders, which\
    \ inﬂuences both the transmitter\nwaiting time and the number of packet duplications.\
    \ The suggested solution relies on\na two-step mechanism. First, each transmitter\
    \ determines a candidate zone such that all\nnodes within the candidate zone are\
    \ potential forwarders. Second, the candidates within\nthe candidate zone are\
    \ prioritized based on a combination of metrics that considers residual\nenergy,\
    \ transmitting direction, distance, and link quality.\n5.1.3. Routing Protocol\
    \ for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)\nA routing protocol for low-power and\
    \ lossy networks (RPL) is a routing protocol\nthat was speciﬁcally designed for\
    \ networks composed of constrained nodes, which are\ninterconnected via unstable\
    \ and lossy links with relatively low packet delivery rates and\ntypically only\
    \ support low data rates (hence, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs)).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ RPL is a distance-vector proactive routing protocol designed for IPv6 low-\n\
    power devices with limited energy, processing, and memory resources (Winter et\
    \ al. [126]).\nRPL constructs a tree routing topology termed the destination-oriented\
    \ directed acyclic\ngraph (DODAG), rooted at one or more sink nodes. The routing\
    \ tree (graph), along\nwhich the trafﬁc traverses, is constructed according to\
    \ an objective function (OF) that can\nutilize a set of metrics such as energy\
    \ consumption, latency, and hop count. The most\ncommon ones are OF0, which ﬁnds\
    \ the shortest path (the path with the minimal hop-count)\nto the sink (Thubert\
    \ et al. [127]), and minimum rank with hysteresis objective function\n(MRHOF),\
    \ which ﬁnds the routes that minimize the link cost associated with the routes\n\
    (Gnawali and Levis [128]). The cost is deﬁned as the latency metric allowing RPL\
    \ to ﬁnd\nstable minimum-latency paths from each node to the sink, or it can be\
    \ associated with the\nexpected transmission count (ETX) metric, which allows\
    \ RPL to ﬁnd the stable minimum-\nETX paths from the nodes to the sink (the default\
    \ metric). In order to achieve stability,\nMRHOF also ensures that a route is\
    \ changed (a node exchanges its preferred parent in\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    20 of 44\nthe routing tree) only if the cost of the improved route is better than\
    \ the current route by\nat least a predeﬁned threshold. RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based\
    \ routing protocol for the\nIoT. Accordingly, several OFs and possible enhancements\
    \ have emerged during recent\nyears, and several performance evaluations and comparisons\
    \ have been presented. In the\nfollowing, we discuss some of these OFs.\nAbdel\
    \ Hakeem et al. [129] analyze the performance of RPL in collecting smart meter\n\
    readings over smart grid (SG) networks via Java-based simulations and IoT-LAB\
    \ testbed ex-\nperiments. Speciﬁcally, Ref. [129] evaluates the RPL performance\
    \ under the two prominent\nobjective functions Hop Count and ETX, in terms of\
    \ packet delivery ratio, network latency,\ncontrol trafﬁc overhead, and power\
    \ consumption. Barnawi et al. [130] utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to examine\
    \ the performance of RPL under duty-cycle MAC protocol.\nSpeciﬁcally, Ref. [130]\
    \ simulates RPL over the classical XMAC protocol and its derivative\nContikiMac,\
    \ where, rather than using a long preamble waiting for the receiver to wake up,\n\
    the sender repeatedly sends the same packet until a link layer acknowledgment\
    \ is received.\nAs a baseline, Ref. [130] uses NullRDC, an always-awake node.\
    \ As expected, the results\nshow that NullRDC is better in terms of latency, while\
    \ ContikiMac outperforms the others\nin terms of power consumption. Al-Shargabi\
    \ and Aleswid [131] also utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to evaluate which\
    \ OF is more suitable for a WSN in healthcare scenarios.\nOF0 and ETX are examined\
    \ in various network topologies, such as the grid and random\ntopology, under\
    \ diverse densities. They conclude that the OF0 is more efﬁcient with respect\n\
    to packet delivery ratio (PDR) and power consumption in the random topology setup.\n\
    Sousa et al. [132] propose an energy-efﬁcient and path-reliability-aware objective\n\
    function (ERAOF). The OF suggested by ERAOF linearly combines energy consumption\n\
    and link quality (in terms of ETX) routing metrics. Even though the selected routes\
    \ are\nnot optimal in either one of the objective metrics, they provide a balance\
    \ between energy\nefﬁciency and reliability. Rafea and Kadhim [133] suggest an\
    \ energy threshold RPL (ETRPL),\nwhich, in addition to the ETX metric, incorporates\
    \ in its objective function the remaining\nenergy of the preferred forwarding\
    \ (parent) node. ETRPL performance is evaluated via\nCooja simulator. Sharma et\
    \ al. [134] suggest another MRHOF-based objective function that\ntakes into account\
    \ three routing metrics: ETX, energy, and delay. Energy consumption,\nin order\
    \ to increase the lifespan of the network, is also considered by Sankar et al.\
    \ [135],\nwhich suggests cluster-tree-based routing protocol to maximize the lifetime\
    \ of IoT (CT-\nRPL). As the name suggests, CT-RPL is a cluster-based routing protocol\
    \ that involves three\nprocesses: cluster formation, cluster-head selection, and\
    \ route establishment. CT-RPL ﬁrst\nscans the nodes and group (cluster) nodes\
    \ whose Euclidean distance from their centroid\npoint is bounded, adding one node\
    \ at a time. Next, each cluster selects its cluster-head\n(CH), utilizing a game-theoretic\
    \ approach in which the node with the maximum payoff\n“p” value—which considers\
    \ parameters such as residual energy, sensing energy, receiving\nenergy, aggregation\
    \ energy, and transmission energy—is selected as the CH node for each\nround.\
    \ Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER),\
    \ queue\nutilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX).\nAnother RPL\
    \ enhancement termed weighted random forward RPL (WRF-RPL) is\nproposed by Acevedo\
    \ et al. [136]. WRF-RPL suggests a load balancing over RPL mechanism,\nwhich distributes\
    \ the trafﬁc between multiple transmission paths, trying to avoid one\npreferred\
    \ parent’s congestions. WRF-RPL OF relies on the composition of two metrics, the\n\
    remaining energy and the count of parent nodes, where the latter aims at prioritizing\
    \ parent\nnodes with more optional paths to the destination. Forwarding decisions\
    \ are probabilistic\naccording to the deﬁned metric, such that nodes with a higher\
    \ number of parents or hops\nare more likely to be selected than others. The authors\
    \ utilize the Cooja simulator for\nevaluation. Rojas et al. [137] leverage a wired\
    \ data center network labeling protocol to\nsuggest IoTorii, a routing protocol\
    \ for LLNs. IoTorii supports multiple paths between\nsender and receiver, and\
    \ requires fewer table entries and control messages, with similar\nperformance\
    \ compared to the standard RPL.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n21 of 44\nMolnár [138]\
    \ provides a graph-theoretic solution to the general problem of QoS-\nconstrained\
    \ routing in WSN that relies on RPL. The authors stress the difference between\n\
    multi-objective optimization and multi-constrained problem setting. Vera-Pérez\
    \ et al. [139]\nexamine the integration of RPL to IEEE 802.15.4e with time-slotted\
    \ channel-hopping (TSCH)\nmedium access mechanism. In particular, Ref. [139] characterizes\
    \ the long deployment\ndelays required for such networks to become operational\
    \ and able to start exchanging data\nmessages. The article proposes an analytical\
    \ model that estimates the average time that the\nsynchronization process can\
    \ take for a new node to join a TSCH-based network, as well as\nan estimation\
    \ of the maximum time required for the formation of a complete network of\nthis\
    \ kind, and the additional time required to set the RPL-based routes. The paper\
    \ validates\nthe analytical model via simulations. A recent comprehensive survey\
    \ on routing protocols\nfor LLN networks in IoT (not exclusive to RPL) can be\
    \ found in [140].\n5.2. Data Aggregation Routing Protocols for Energy Harvesting\
    \ WSN\nAs discussed in Section 2, an alternative for relying on batteries as the\
    \ source of energy,\nwith their imposed constraints (e.g., size, replacement,\
    \ etc.), is to embrace energy-harvesting\n(EH) technology. However, as mentioned\
    \ earlier, relying on EH imposes different con-\nstraints and limitations. Such\
    \ constraints can make battery-reliant schemes impractical\nwhen devising data\
    \ collection procedures. When battery-reliant schemes are applied to\nEH-based\
    \ platforms, performance can be highly degraded. Speciﬁcally, relying on EH can\n\
    induce high diversity between the different nodes, as different nodes can have\
    \ different\nattributes, such as energy depletion and charging rates, which affect\
    \ the nodes’ availability;\nin addition, different nodes can have different roles,\
    \ such as different reporting rates or\ndifferent report importance, requiring\
    \ more energy usage, which eventually also affects the\nnodes’ availability. When\
    \ a sensor is expected to transmit or receive a report, it needs to\nhave sufﬁcient\
    \ energy to complete the transaction; therefore, reliance on EH needs to be\n\
    considered when designing a scheduling protocol. For example, a data collection\
    \ scheme\nthat relies on EH should adapt the report rate to energy availability;\
    \ it can compromise\nthe rate of less important reports coming from the sensors\
    \ to leave them sufﬁcient energy\nfor emergency reports. It can prioritize sensors\
    \ with more energy over those with lower\nenergy, especially when there is some\
    \ redundancy in the reports received by different\nsensors. This is especially\
    \ so when dealing with multi-hop routing, where many of the\nnodes serve as relays\
    \ and have the burden to stay awake longer, to receive and transmit\nmore, which\
    \ escalates the heterogeneity of the nodes and accentuates the difference in\n\
    importance between the different nodes. Furthermore, if on a single-hop network,\
    \ we\ncould rely on the receiver (sink) to have unlimited power (connected to\
    \ a power source), in\nmulti-hop topologies also, the receivers rely on EH; hence,\
    \ when scheduling a transmission,\nwe need to ensure that both transmitter and\
    \ receiver have sufﬁcient power to complete the\ntransaction. In the following,\
    \ we present several routing protocol adaptations for EH-WSN\nin the context of\
    \ data aggregation.\nThe typical setup considers that each node (sensor) encompasses\
    \ an energy har-\nvester and an energy storage device and is solely powered by\
    \ the renewable energy\navailable to it by its energy storage device. A multi-hop\
    \ topology is considered such\nthat the data from many of the sensors need to\
    \ traverse multiple links before reaching the\nsink. Jeong et al. [141] propose\
    \ an adaptive data aggregation scheme for energy-harvesting\nWSNs. The suggested\
    \ scheme relies on two residual-energy thresholds, lower and upper.\nEach node\
    \ periodically estimates its residual energy level to determine whether or not\
    \ to\ntransmit data. When the node’s residual energy is either above the upper\
    \ threshold or\nbelow the lower threshold, the node transmits its aggregated data.\
    \ If its energy is below\nthe lower threshold, the node enters energy-saving mode\
    \ after transmitting the data. Its\nradio is turned off, and it waits to regain\
    \ sufﬁcient energy before turning its radio back\non. In normal operation mode,\
    \ where the residual energy is between the two thresholds,\nthe node only aggregates\
    \ data received from other nodes and collects its own sensed data.\nIf a node’s\
    \ aggregated data in normal mode exceeds its storage limit, the node transmits\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n22 of 44\nthe data regardless of its residual energy.\
    \ While this scheme is clear and straightforward\nto implement, it lacks latency\
    \ evaluation and a discussion about rendezvous between a\ntransmitter and a receiver.\n\
    Chen et al. [142] experimentally show that in energy-harvesting-based wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks (EH-WSNs), the required nodes’ charging time to be ready to\
    \ receive or send a\npacket is much greater than the time required for the contention\
    \ resolution mechanism and\ndominates the data aggregation latency. In addition\
    \ to the common collision deﬁnitions, the\npaper deﬁnes an “energy-collision”,\
    \ which occurs due to battery level constraint and not\ndue to simultaneous transmissions.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, energy-collision occurs when a transmitter-\nreceiver tuple is\
    \ scheduled for transmission, but the transmission cannot take place because\n\
    at least one of the two nodes has insufﬁcient energy to transmit or receive the\
    \ packet due\nto recent activity (insufﬁcient time has elapsed since its last\
    \ transmission or reception to\nharvest enough energy for the subsequent scheduled\
    \ transmission). An adaptable data\naggregation tree is constructed, which considers\
    \ each node’s residual and harvested energy,\nand three energy-collision-aware\
    \ data aggregation algorithms are proposed.\n5.2.1. Cluster-Based Routing Protocol\
    \ That Relies on EH\nSeveral studies have suggested various adaptations for LEACH\
    \ WSN cluster-based\nrouting protocol (e.g., [106]) for EH-based WSN (EH-WSN).\
    \ Recall that LEACH’s cluster-\nhead selection mechanism randomly selects sensor\
    \ nodes as cluster-heads to distribute\nthe energy consumption between them evenly,\
    \ which can seemingly cope with the EH\nconstraints. However, note that even when\
    \ the nodes’ platform is exactly the same, the\npotential of different nodes to\
    \ harvest energy, dependent on their speciﬁc ambient con-\nditions, can be very\
    \ different. Furthermore, the node’s location with respect to the sink\ncan highly\
    \ inﬂuence the amount of data it needs to relay toward the sink, causing high\n\
    discrepancies between the energy utilized by various nodes. To cope with these\
    \ discrepan-\ncies, Xiao et al. [143] modify LEACH’s cluster-head selection mechanism\
    \ and deﬁne a new\nmetric termed “energy potential function” to measure each node’s\
    \ capability to harvest\nenergy. The paper devises a cluster-head selection strategy\
    \ that prioritizes nodes with\nhigher expected stored energy (based on the currently\
    \ available energy and their potential\nenergy) to become cluster-heads, regardless\
    \ of the number of instances that the node was\nselected as cluster-head in the\
    \ past.\nTo address the imbalance between the energy expected to be consumed by\
    \ cluster-\nheads (CHs) that are closer to the sink and are expected to spend\
    \ more energy on relaying\npackets from farther clusters, and CHs that are further\
    \ from the sink and expected to relay\nless trafﬁc, Wu et al. [144] suggest an\
    \ unbalanced clustering mechanism. In particular,\ncluster sizes are determined\
    \ according to the distance (hop count) to the sink to balance the\nenergy consumption\
    \ of the CHs. Accordingly, clusters closer to the sink, which are expected\nto\
    \ relay more inter-cluster trafﬁc, will be smaller, so that they collect less\
    \ intra-cluster\ntrafﬁc; clusters further away from the sink and expected to relay\
    \ less inter-cluster trafﬁc\nwill comprise more nodes, so that they collect more\
    \ intra-cluster trafﬁc. The mechanism\nsuggested to attain this balance is partitioning\
    \ the network conceptually into concentric\nrings around the sink with linearly\
    \ increasing radii. Each ring comprises nodes with\nthe same hop distance to the\
    \ sink. Clusters within the same ring will have the same\nsize. CH selection is\
    \ designed to balance the loads of each ring considering the available\nnodes’\
    \ energy, which is evaluated based on the EH rate. Following a similar approach,\n\
    Yang et al. [145] assume a highly symmetric circular sensor network in which the\
    \ sink\n(BS) is located at the center, and the sensors are distributed evenly\
    \ in a disc around it.\nAs with [144], the sensor ﬁeld is divided into concentric\
    \ rings; however, in this study,\nthe rings are determined to have an equal area\
    \ such that the number of sensors in each\nring is expected to be the same. Under\
    \ the given model, Ref. [145] analyzes the energy\nconsumption of intra- and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmission and derives the energy neutrality\nconstraints, which guarantee\
    \ that each node consumes less energy than the amount of\nenergy it has harvested.\
    \ The authors further devise a constraint formula of the number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n23 of 44\nclusters required in each layer (ring) that balances the\
    \ average energy consumption of nodes\nin different layers. The energy neutrality\
    \ constraints and the cluster parameters are used to\nobtain the parameters (number\
    \ of rings, number of clusters in each ring, and minimum\nnetwork data transmission\
    \ cycle) that minimize the data transmission cycle. Based on the\nattained parameters,\
    \ the cluster-based routing protocol is derived. The protocol consists\nof an\
    \ initialization phase and repeated cycles divided into topology formation and\
    \ data-\ngathering phases. Bahbahani and Alsusa [146] suggest two separate enhancements.\
    \ The\nﬁrst, termed cooperative transmission strategy, enables nodes to serve\
    \ as relays to relay\nundelivered packets from cluster members to CHs and from\
    \ CHs to the sink node. The\nsecond mechanism, termed cluster-head duty-cycle,\
    \ regulates the frequency at which a node\ncan become a CH based on duty-cycling\
    \ that adapts to the node’s energy-harvesting rate.\nTo conserve the energy of\
    \ nodes that are more susceptible to energy depletion,\nBozorgi et al. [147] select\
    \ CHs, taking into account their residual energy, expected har-\nvest energy,\
    \ distance from the sink, number of neighbors, and, similar to LEACH, the\nnumber\
    \ of times a node has already served as a CH in the past. The proposed approach,\n\
    which combines centralized and distributed mechanisms, relies on a signal transmitted\n\
    by the sink that can be received by all the nodes, which allows them to estimate\
    \ their\ngeographic distance from the sink. The network is partitioned by the\
    \ sink into four layers\nbased on distance. The sink further computes the individual\
    \ coverage radius of each node\n(potential CH) based on distance (nodes closer\
    \ to the sink, which are therefore expected\nto relay trafﬁc coming from more\
    \ distant clusters, will have a smaller radius, and thus\nless intra-cluster trafﬁc;\
    \ on the other hand, nodes farther away from the sink, which are\ntherefore expected\
    \ to have less inter-cluster trafﬁc to relay, are assigned a longer radius,\n\
    and therefore more intra-cluster trafﬁc). The paper suggests a distributed contention-based\n\
    mechanism for selecting the CHs in which the contention window takes into account\
    \ the\nparameters mentioned above. Another cluster-based routing for EH-WSN is\
    \ proposed by\nRen and Yao [148]. The proposed routing scheme is divided into\
    \ cluster establishment and\ndata collection. It is suggested that besides the\
    \ typical cluster members (CMs) and cluster-\nhead (CH), a new entity be devised,\
    \ termed in the paper scheduling node (SN), which is\ndifferent from the CH. The\
    \ main task of the SN is to monitor the energy of all the cluster\nmembers during\
    \ the data collection stage and select a CH based on the monitored residual\n\
    energy of the cluster members. The transmission range of nodes can also be adjusted\
    \ based\non their residual energy. The data collection stage, which adapts a round-based\
    \ scheme\nsimilar to LEACH, is divided into the data transmission and CH selection\
    \ stages.\nSinde et al. [149] aim to improve the network efﬁciency by three means:\
    \ (i) clusteriza-\ntion mechanism that takes into account energy consumption during\
    \ the data aggregation\nphase, (ii) duty cycle adaptation of each node such that\
    \ each sensor node determines its\nmode of operation, and (iii) routing mechanism\
    \ based on ant colony optimization that\nchooses the path between the source and\
    \ the sink node that reduces the delay incurred.\nOverall, while the paper jointly\
    \ addresses several topics in WSN, including those connected\nto energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data gathering, its main contribution is the detailed NS3 simulation.\n5.2.2.\
    \ Mobile Charger\nToday’s technology enables dedicated wireless charging equipment\
    \ (WCE) to recharge\nthe nodes’ batteries, prolonging the lifetime of wireless\
    \ rechargeable sensor networks.\nA model in which, in addition to the sink (base\
    \ station), a mobile station will navigate\nthrough the WSN to collect data and\
    \ charge sensor nodes is considered by Liu et al. [150].\nThe paper suggests a\
    \ joint routing and charging strategy. The joint problem is decomposed\ninto two\
    \ sub-optimization problems: routing tree optimization and charging path optimiza-\n\
    tion. Heuristic algorithms based on simulated annealing algorithms were applied\
    \ to solve\nthese sub-optimization problems.\nA joint charging and routing algorithm\
    \ with WCE-assisted data gathering is also\nsuggested by Lu et al. [151]. The\
    \ model suggested therein assumes that the BS (sink) can\nget the information\
    \ of each node at any time, including node location, residual energy,\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n24 of 44\nand energy consumption rate. The suggested approach\
    \ relates to data routing and energy\nsupplement to undercharged nodes. The data\
    \ routing algorithm considers several factors:\nsensor buffer occupancy, load,\
    \ and energy. To ﬁnd the route for the mobile recharging\nunit to traverse, they\
    \ rely on Du [152] to seek the shortest Hamiltonian cycle between the\nnodes that\
    \ urgently need energy replenishment traversed by the mobile recharging unit.\n\
    Additional nodes along the traversed path can also be charged. Furthermore, the\
    \ mobile\nrecharging unit can also gather data from sensors with a critical buffer\
    \ occupancy during\nits recharging cycle.\nIn the following section, we discuss\
    \ network coding (NC) and, in particular, linear\nnetwork coding in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\n5.3. Network Coding (NC)\nNetwork coding leverages\
    \ the routing protocols and the ability to construct multi-path\nrouting between\
    \ sources and their destination (the sink) to enable intermediate nodes to\nperform\
    \ coding on the incoming packets before forwarding them. In the following section,\n\
    we discuss network-coding-related works.\nLinear network coding was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ by Celebiler and Stette [153] and evolved in\nthe seminal paper by Ahlswede\
    \ et al. [154] as a means to improve the network’s throughput,\nefﬁciency, and\
    \ scalability, which can also be leveraged to improve the network resilience\n\
    to attacks and eavesdropping. Linear network coding allows the network’s intermediate\n\
    nodes (e.g., relays) to accumulate arriving messages and forward a newly encoded\
    \ message,\nwhich is a linear combination of the accumulated packets, multiplying\
    \ them by coefﬁcients\nchosen from a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The manner in which nodes encode\
    \ and decode messages de-\npends on the selected coding scheme. Network coding\
    \ (NC) over wireless communication\ncan reduce the number of transmissions by\
    \ leveraging the fact that a single transmission is\noverheard by multiple nodes\
    \ in the transmitter’s vicinity, and can therefore be utilized by\neach of these\
    \ nodes, which will forward a coded packet with unique coefﬁcients comprising\n\
    its own message and the messages it overheard (e.g., [155]).\nIn WSNs, NC can\
    \ be utilized for various trafﬁc patterns, including data dissemination\n(one-to-many\
    \ communication) and data gathering. Works on energy-efﬁcient NC-based\ndissemination\
    \ can be followed in the survey [156], with multi-hop routing being empha-\nsized.\
    \ In data dissemination in which the base station/sink distributes information\
    \ to\nthe sensor nodes, NC is beneﬁcial mainly for distributing control messages\
    \ (broadcast or\nmulticast trafﬁc) or, in case of unicast trafﬁc, for recovering\
    \ lost packets (retransmissions).\nThe latter utilization relies on the fact that\
    \ different nodes heard or did not hear different\npackets. Accordingly, nodes\
    \ store packets they overheard, even if not destined to them-\nselves. The transmitter\
    \ (e.g., access-point) accumulates several packets that need to be\nretransmitted,\
    \ each for a different receiver. It transmits a coded packet that is a composite\n\
    of these accumulated packets. Each receiver can decode a missing packet by utilizing\
    \ its\nstored overheard packets (e.g., [157–162], where the last two mainly focus\
    \ on data dis-\nsemination of control management messages. It is noteworthy that\
    \ Cohen et al. [157] also\npresent a successful real HW radio deployment of their\
    \ scheme. XOR-CoW [163] exploits\nthe same concept to design an IoT protocol in\
    \ which relays transmit coded packets that\nmix downlink and uplink trafﬁc. Similar\
    \ to other previously mentioned studies, the coding\nscheme by Swamy et al. [163]\
    \ is over ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld of size 2 (GF(2)) (i.e., XORing the\ncoded packets).\n\
    Network coding is widely explored for data-gathering schemes. Typically, an NC-\n\
    based protocol involves both the coding scheme and the multi-path routing. It\
    \ relies on\nthe relay nodes to overhear packets and perform the coding, and on\
    \ the sink (or multiple\nsinks) to collect sufﬁcient coded packets (combinations)\
    \ to encode the sent information.\nThe limited ability of the sensors constrains\
    \ NC over WSN (e.g., limited storage to store\noverheard packets, limited computation\
    \ power to perform sophisticated operations, limited\nawake time for packet overhearing,\
    \ etc.). The utilized coding scheme inﬂuences the\nperformance of the NC algorithm\
    \ in several aspects such as the throughput, algorithm\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    25 of 44\ncomplexity, encoding complexity, decoding complexity, packet overhead\
    \ (bits), required\nfeedback, and so on. Note that many of these metrics are directly\
    \ translated to air time\nand energy consumption, which must be considered in\
    \ WSN. The random linear network\ncoding (RLNC) encoding scheme (e.g., [164])\
    \ is widely used because, despite its simplicity,\nit can attain throughput that\
    \ is close to the optimal one using a decentralized algorithm.\nIn RLNC, relays\
    \ transmit random linear combinations of the packets they receive, with\nrandomly\
    \ chosen coefﬁcients from a ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld (GF). The receiver must obtain a\n\
    sufﬁcient number of linearly independent combinations (packets) to decode the\
    \ original\npackets. If the GF size is sufﬁciently large, the probability that\
    \ the randomly generated\ncombinations will be linearly independent is high. However,\
    \ the receiver needs to know the\ncoefﬁcient used in each combination; hence,\
    \ it needs to be sent as overhead piggybacked on\neach traversed packet. The larger\
    \ the GF size, the higher the overhead. RLNC scheme with\ndistributed encoding\
    \ was utilized by Stefanovi´c et al. [165] for a perimeter data-gathering\nobjective,\
    \ in which the data should reach the perimeter nodes that are located on the\n\
    boundary of the covered area. The proposed scheme does not deploy routing algorithms\
    \ or\nmaintain routing information and relies on random walks.\nOne disadvantage\
    \ of RLNC is its decoding complexity in the order of O(n3), where n\ndenotes the\
    \ number of original packets. Sparse end-to-end erasure-correcting codes can\n\
    reduce the decoding load on the receiver at the cost of introducing an additional,\
    \ non-\nnegligible delay. Feizi et al. [166] suggest a tunable sparse network\
    \ coding (TSNC) scheme\nthat tunes the level of sparsity as the transmission process\
    \ evolves. This tuning process\ncan reduce the delay overhead by using denser\
    \ codes towards the end of the transmission\nwhile maintaining the complexity\
    \ advantages of a sparse code. Prior et al. [167] propose\ntwo network coding\
    \ schemes for information gathering, which are based on tunable sparse\ncodes,\
    \ with and without explicit feedback from the sink. The suggested schemes are\n\
    designed for meter readings in a smart grid. Nistor et al. [168] further exploit\
    \ RLNC and\nTSNC for data gathering and derived analytical bounds for a multi-hop\
    \ line network using\na ﬂuid model, which is valid for any ﬁeld size and various\
    \ sparsity levels, and has two\ndifferent feedback mechanisms.\nSenseCode [169]\
    \ adopts the NC paradigm, aspiring to balance energy efﬁciency and\nend-to-end\
    \ packet error rate. SenseCode relies on nodes transmitting both uncoded and\n\
    coded packets. Each node stores only a small portion of the packets it overhears,\
    \ which can\nbe attained by letting the node wake up sporadically within its duty\
    \ cycle and stay awake\nfor a short time interval each time it wakes up, storing\
    \ overheard packets. Accordingly,\neach coded packet comprises only a small subset\
    \ of the packets the node could have\npotentially overheard and coded. NetCoDer\
    \ [170] concentrates on a star topology in\nwhich the star-head can be a sink\
    \ or a relay that collects information from its neighbors.\nNetCoDer opportunistically\
    \ selects, based on network conditions, a set of relays that, in\naddition to\
    \ the data sent by the nodes, send additional coded packets with packets they\n\
    overheard, which helps the star-head recover lost packets. To reduce the overhead,\
    \ the\nrelays use LNC coefﬁcients based on the addresses of the sensor nodes.\
    \ A similar idea\nthat also does not rely on feedback was presented in SR-Code\
    \ [171] in which nodes and\nrelays send redundant coded messages to help the sink\
    \ recover lost messages. SR-Code\nutilizes the XOR operator (GF(2)). Similar to\
    \ NetCoDer, SR-Code reduces the overhead\nby using a bitmap to identify the coded\
    \ packets rather than the address of the sending\nnode. Al-Hawri et al. [172]\
    \ assume a data-gathering setup with single or multiple gateways\n(sinks) that\
    \ can collaborate (exchange information via accessible shared distributed storage\n\
    system). The paper distinguishes between traditional relays, which forward packets\
    \ they\nreceive as-is, and encoding relays, which perform network-coding on the\
    \ packets they\nreceive before forwarding them. The authors suggest a mathematical\
    \ model and a heuristic\nalgorithm to determine the number of network-encoding\
    \ nodes and their location, which\nis insufﬁcient for the aggregate received data\
    \ at the gateway/gateways to be decodable,\ntaking into account link failure scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n26 of 44\nProtocols that utilize NC in WSN need to balance\
    \ achieving the NC expedience and\ndiverse performance criteria. On the one hand,\
    \ the motivation is to send only coded packets,\nas sending uncoded packets degrades\
    \ the NC gain. On the other hand, a strategy in which\na relay waits for packets\
    \ to arrive in order to code them can yield unacceptable delays.\nFurthermore,\
    \ storing arriving packets while waiting for additional packets to arrive before\n\
    coding them can result in a buffer overﬂow and packet loss. To overcome these\
    \ drawbacks,\nChen et al. [173] suggest an opportunistic network coding (ONC)\
    \ approach in which the\nrelay can transmit either coded or uncoded packets. Each\
    \ relay determines whether to\ntransmit a coded or uncoded packet according to\
    \ its queue state at each transmission\nopportunity. For the simple topology of\
    \ a relay interconnecting two nodes that communi-\ncate with one another, Ref.\
    \ [173] presents an ONC strategy that can achieve the optimal\ndelay/power tradeoff.\
    \ Mirani et al. [174] adopt the ONC paradigm for data dissemination\nin vehicular\
    \ ad hoc networks (VANETs), for which the mobile nodes (vehicles) employ a\ndecode-and-forward\
    \ scheme with subjective timers determined according to their distance\nfrom the\
    \ source. In Tan et al. [175], an opportunistic routing protocol with opportunistic\n\
    network coding is proposed for correlated data gathering.\nNext, we provide more\
    \ recent works that utilize NC in WSNs and related networks\nthat are not particular\
    \ to data-gathering applications. Marques et al. [176] propose to use\nNC in a\
    \ fog computing scenario, since in the fog computing system architecture, the\
    \ data\nmeasured on a node should be delivered to many other destination nodes.\
    \ The authors\ndesign a protocol for encoding and decoding and provide a design\
    \ to incorporate it on\nthe MAC level. Uwitonze et al. [177] consider a setup\
    \ in which a WSN has been split into\nmultiple disjoint partitions and suggests\
    \ a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on\nspace network coding termed\
    \ relay placement using space network coding (i.e., rather than\nsend additional\
    \ coded data, additional relay nodes are deployed) for ﬁnding the optimal\nnumber\
    \ and positions to place relay nodes for restoring the network connectivity.\n\
    A network coding backpressure routing scheme for data aggregation in large-scale\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) networks is explored by Malathy et al. [178]. The proposed\
    \ routing\nscheme exploits network coding for the data aggregation process, which\
    \ improves the\nthroughput of the network by eliminating redundant packets. The\
    \ paper relies on cluster-\nbased routing that selects the cluster-heads (CH)\
    \ based on the available energy and distance,\nwhich helps to minimize trafﬁc\
    \ congestion and provide efﬁcient data transmission.\n5.4. Data Collection Utilizing\
    \ Mobile Sink and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nA different paradigm for the\
    \ traditional setup of data gathering in WSN, which\nrelies on a single or multiple\
    \ static sink(s) towards which all trafﬁc needs to travel, is\nthe utilization\
    \ of one or multiple mobile sinks (MSs) that traverse the terrain and collect\n\
    the reports from the devices. Such mobile sink(s) can be the trafﬁc’s ﬁnal destination\
    \ or\njust an accessory that collects the data and transmits it to the sink. Note\
    \ that in the latter\ncase, the ﬁnal destination is not necessarily located within\
    \ the wireless network realm\nand can be located outside it (e.g., within the\
    \ Internet or the cloud). Since these mobile\nsinks are unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ in many cases, these systems are sometimes called\nunmanned aerial vehicle-wireless\
    \ sensor networks (UAV–WSNs). This section reviews\nseveral state-of-the-art developments\
    \ in mobile sink(s). Since sometimes the MS routing\nchallenges are interleaved\
    \ with the MAC layer’s challenges, the solution suggested in some\npapers, and\
    \ accordingly their description, incorporated both layers.\nTypically, data-gathering\
    \ protocols that utilize moving sink(s) aim at optimizing some\nperformance metrics,\
    \ such as overall power consumption, average or worst latency of the\ndata, trajectory\
    \ traversed by the mobile sink, awake time of the sensors, maximizing the\nlife\
    \ cycle of the network, and so on. There are different options to classify these\
    \ protocols:\nthey can be classiﬁed according to this aforementioned performance\
    \ objective, or other\ncategories, such as characteristics of the moving sink,\
    \ its speed and constraints, network\nmodel, communication standard utilized,\
    \ and so on. In this section, we will classify the\nprotocol into two classes:\
    \ protocols that solely rely on the moving sink with no intra-trafﬁc\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n27 of 44\nbetween the nodes (all the trafﬁc is directly transmitted\
    \ to the moving sink), and protocols\nthat combine routing between the nodes and\
    \ trafﬁc forwarding to the sink. This latter\nclass will mostly include cluster-based\
    \ protocols in which the nodes are clustered and\ncluster-heads (CHs) are selected,\
    \ but rather than the CHs routing the trafﬁc towards the\nsink, they forward the\
    \ trafﬁc directly to the mobile sink.\n5.4.1. Routing Directly to the Mobile Sink(s)\
    \ with No Intra-Node Data Forwarding\nIn this section, we review papers in which\
    \ the only data trafﬁc is between the nodes\nand the mobile sink, and no data\
    \ is forwarded between the nodes.\nZhan et al. [179] consider a general fading\
    \ channel model and suggest an efﬁcient\nsub-optimal solution that minimizes the\
    \ energy consumption of all sensor nodes (SNs)\nwhile ensuring that data is collected\
    \ reliably from all SNs with bounded outage probability.\nThe suggested solution\
    \ decouples the joint optimization problem, which considers both\nthe SNs’ wake-up\
    \ schedule and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV’s) trajectory, into two\nseparate\
    \ optimization problems, ensuring that the amount of data collected from each\
    \ SN\nreliably exceeds a threshold. One of the formulated optimization problems\
    \ is non-convex\ndue to non-convex constraints, and therefore it needs to be relaxed.\
    \ The two problems are\nsolved iteratively to obtain an approximate solution.\
    \ A ﬂight time minimization problem\nfor a UAV that collects data from a set of\
    \ energy-constrained ground sensors is studied by\nGong et al. [180]. The sensors\
    \ are assumed to be located on a line (one dimension). Each\nsensor has a certain\
    \ amount of data to upload. The UAV can collect data either while\nﬂying or while\
    \ hovering, and only from a single sensor at a time. Accordingly, the UAV’s\n\
    trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, each dedicated\
    \ to\ncollecting data from a single sensor. The objective is to minimize the total\
    \ ﬂight time of the\nUAV from an initial point to a destination by jointly optimizing\
    \ the division of intervals, the\nUAV’s speed, as well as the sensors’ transmission\
    \ power. The ﬂight time minimization is\nformulated as a dynamic programming (DP)\
    \ problem, where each DP stage considers ﬂight\ntime minimization for a single-sensor\
    \ data collection scenario. The algorithm for the single-\nsensor case is used\
    \ to ﬁnd the UAV’s optimal speed and the sensor’s transmission power.\nIt is shown\
    \ that the UAV’s optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors\n\
    and the inter-sensor distance but is inversely proportional to the data upload\
    \ requirements.\nThe metric addressed by Liu et al. [181] is the age of the information.\
    \ In particular,\nRef. [181] utilizes UAV, and suggests two age-optimal trajectories\
    \ for it to collect the\ndata from the ground SNs, one that minimizes the age\
    \ of the ‘oldest’ sensed information\namong the sensors, and another that minimizes\
    \ the average age of the information sensed\nby all sensors. It is shown that\
    \ both age-optimal trajectories correspond to the shortest\nHamiltonian path in\
    \ the wireless sensor network, in which the distance between any\ntwo sensors\
    \ is represented by the amount of inter-visit time. The authors adopt dynamic\n\
    programming and genetic algorithm to ﬁnd the two different age-optimal trajectories.\n\
    Liu et al. [182] also utilize a UAV to collect the data from the ground sensors.\
    \ The model\nsuggested therein assumes that the sensors (nodes) are randomly distributed\
    \ over a square\narea. The area is partitioned into small square cells. The UAV\
    \ ﬂying above the cells\nhovers above each cell to collect all the data of the\
    \ sensors within the cell. The paper\nstudies the amount of data per unit time\
    \ that the UAV can collect from the ground nodes\nas a function of the number\
    \ of cells, the height of the UAV, the number of sensors, and\nthe energy capacity\
    \ of the UAV. The paper suggests a similar analysis when multiple\nUAVs are utilized.\
    \ It seeks the optimal number of cells to maximize the per-node capacity\nunder\
    \ the suggested model and shows that under the suggested data collection network,\n\
    multiple UAVs can signiﬁcantly improve the per-node capacity attained by a single\
    \ UAV.\nThe balanced network communication protocol (BNCP) that utilizes UAV as\
    \ a mobile\nsink is suggested by Qin et al. [183]. There is no inter-sensor routing\
    \ in BNCP, and all\nsensors’ communication energy is spent on the sensor-UAV transmission\
    \ links. BNCP is\nimplemented and evaluated.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n28 of 44\n\
    5.4.2. Cluster-Based Data Forwarding\nRather than the mobile sink node traversing\
    \ the network between all the sensors, a\ndifferent approach groups the sensors\
    \ into clusters and selects cluster-heads (CH), which\ncollect the data from all\
    \ cluster members, thus decreasing the traverse of the mobile sink.\nIn general,\
    \ data gathering in a clustered WSN imposes a tradeoff between the energy\nconsumed\
    \ during data collection within each cluster and the energy consumed by the\n\
    mobile sink. On the one hand, the higher the number of clusters (smaller clusters),\
    \ the\nless energy is consumed during data collection by the cluster-heads (CH);\
    \ on the other\nhand, it follows that the UAV will have to access more CHs on\
    \ its route, and consequently,\nthe energy spent by the UAV will be higher in\
    \ that case. This trade-off is one of the main\nchallenges in addressing the joint\
    \ problem of clusterization and CH selection, jointly with\nﬁnding the path traversed\
    \ by the UAV, as reﬂected in several papers discussed below.\nNajjar-Ghabel et\
    \ al. [184] propose a two-phase algorithm, termed DGOB, for data\ngathering in\
    \ WSNs in an environment impaired by obstacles, which utilizes a mobile sink\n\
    that traverses the network and collects the data. Both phases, node clusterization\
    \ and\nMS trajectory construction, exploit artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) schemes.\
    \ Tazibt et al. [185]\nutilize a small-scale drone to gather the data from scattered\
    \ sensors. Like in several other\npapers that rely on UAV to collect data from\
    \ cluster-heads, the challenge in [185] is two-fold:\n(i) clusterization and CH\
    \ selection (in contrast with other papers, this paper allows multi-\nhop clusters,\
    \ such that cluster members are up to a predeﬁned number of hops from their\n\
    CH); and (ii) plan of the drone trajectory for traversing through all CHs with\
    \ minimum\nenergy consumption (e.g., minimum path length). Even though the two\
    \ problems are\nrelated, the authors solve the two issues sequentially. They ﬁrst\
    \ solve the CH selection\nby formulating an optimization problem that seeks the\
    \ minimal set of cluster-heads that\nguarantee that all nodes are at most h hops\
    \ from a CH in the set. After determining the CH\nset via linear programing, they\
    \ utilize the 2-opt heuristic, which relies on a simple local\nsearch algorithm\
    \ for solving the traveling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the optimal\ntravel\
    \ trajectory for the drone between the selected CHs.\nKumar and Dash [186] also\
    \ suggest a data-gathering-by-mobile-sink scheme in WSN.\nThe model in [186] assumes\
    \ that the mobile sink is moving along a pre-speciﬁed path with\nconstant speed\
    \ and can collect data while traveling. The paper denotes all the sensors\nthat\
    \ are in transmission range from the mobile-sink traversed path, and can therefore\n\
    relay trafﬁc to it, as sub-sinks. All other nodes need to forward their data to\
    \ these sub-\nsinks, possibly through multi-hop communication, in order for them\
    \ to relay the data\nto the mobile sink. The paper suggests two different models:\
    \ the ﬁrst assumes that the\nmobile sink can receive data from only one sensor\
    \ at a time, while the second assumes that\nthe mobile sink can receive data from\
    \ multiple sensors simultaneously. Both suggested\nalgorithms comprise three phases:\
    \ (i) identify the relay nodes (sub-sinks) that are within\ntransmission range\
    \ from the mobile sink trajectory (unit disk graph model), and partition\nthe\
    \ path into segments that are the union of all the transmission disks of all the\
    \ sub-sinks;\n(ii) determine the communication time each sub-sink can have with\
    \ the mobile sink, and\naccordingly, the amount of data it can transmit; (iii)\
    \ utilize a network ﬂow approach to\ndetermine which sub-sink transmits to the\
    \ mobile sink in each of the mobile sink’s path\nsegments. Ebrahimi et al. [187]\
    \ aim to optimize total transmission power between WSN\ncluster-heads in an IoT\
    \ network. The problem is split into subproblems, which include\nCH assignment,\
    \ building of the forwarding tree within each cluster, and optimal UAV\ntrajectory\
    \ calculation. The data transmitted by CH to UAV is pre-processed by a specialized\n\
    optimized compression. A genetic algorithm for energy-efﬁcient CH selection is\
    \ employed\nby Wu et al. [188].\nThe focus of Zahra et al. [189] is on MS that\
    \ traverses a WSN that relies on a cluster-\nbased data collection protocol in\
    \ which cluster-heads are responsible for collecting and\ntransmitting the cluster\
    \ members’ sensed data to the MS. The paper examines a scenario in\nwhich the\
    \ MS is constantly moving in a predeﬁned trajectory, regardless of whether the\n\
    data transfer was completed or not. Accordingly, when the cluster aggregate data\
    \ is too\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n29 of 44\nlarge, the CH cannot complete the\
    \ transaction. The authors suggest a mechanism in which,\nin case the CH cannot\
    \ complete the transaction, it can use different cluster members as\nrelays to\
    \ continue the transaction after the MS has moved out of the transmission range\n\
    of the CH. Likewise, Zhang et al. [190] also suggest a hybrid approach that combines\
    \ the\nMS with hierarchical routing-based protocol relying on node clusterization.\
    \ In order to\nimprove the efﬁciency of the MS data collection, Ref. [190] suggests\
    \ utilizing virtual heads\n(VHs) that lie on the MS trajectory on the cluster\
    \ boundaries that also transmit collected\ndata to the MS. The channel access\
    \ relies on a random access mechanism.\nThe UAV can be of different physical structures.\
    \ While some machines are able to slow\ndown and even to hover, others, especially\
    \ the winged UAVs, can only ﬂy with a constant\nvelocity. This limitation poses\
    \ an additional challenge; see Say et al. [191] for a possible\nsolution. To address\
    \ the velocity limitation, the grid topology of the UAV’s coverage is\ndivided\
    \ into frames, and the most distant frames get the highest priority. The priority-based\n\
    transmissions from sensors to the moving UAV are incorporated into a MAC layer,\
    \ by\nintroducing a priority-based contention window adjustment scheme. A smaller\
    \ contention\nwindow is assigned to the frame where sensors send packets from\
    \ the rear side of the UAV,\nand should therefore have a higher transmission priority.\
    \ This results in a low packet loss\nwhen the UAV ﬂies forward. On top of this\
    \ architecture, a frame-selection-based routing\nprotocol is formulated.\n6. Wearables\
    \ and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN)\nNumerous applications rely on data gathering\
    \ and report collection in WSN and IoT,\nand some are mentioned throughout the\
    \ paper. There is no doubt that the essence of WSN\nis the applications that utilize\
    \ the infrastructure discussed throughout this paper. Providing\na thorough review\
    \ of such applications can encompass several surveys. Since wearables\nare becoming\
    \ highly popular and a ubiquitous application which imposes new challenges\nin\
    \ the context of data gathering, we discuss several recent results and related\
    \ challenges in\nthe context of wearables. Figure 5 depicts the main topics discussed\
    \ in this section.\nWearables and WBAN\nSection 6\nEnergy Harvesting (EH)\nSection\
    \ 6.1\nTechnological Advances\nSection 6.2\nTransmission Protocols\nSection 6.3\n\
    WBAN Applications\nSection 6.4\nFigure 5. The main topics in the context of wearables\
    \ covered in the section, and a rough partition of\nthe papers covered by these\
    \ topics.\nWearable technology refers to smart devices attached to the human body\
    \ or apparel\nto monitor the user and their environment. Wearables are designed\
    \ to detect, analyze,\nand transmit information, which allows continuous monitoring\
    \ of the subject. In some\ncases (e.g., healthcare applications), feedback is\
    \ returned to the wearer with strict perfor-\nmance constraints (e.g., reliability,\
    \ latency bounds). Such applications can necessitate the\nmonitoring of both bodily\
    \ conditions, such as blood pressure, blood glucose level (e.g.,\nin conjunction\
    \ with an insulin pump), ECG, EMG, body temperature, accelerometer, and\ngyroscope,\
    \ as well as environmental conditions that might inﬂuence the user, such as\n\
    temperature, humidity, CO2 level, dust level, and location.\nSensing essential\
    \ human physiological parameters led to the innovation of wireless\nbody area\
    \ networks (WBANs). WBAN typically relates to a small area network that spans\n\
    the whole human body. It comprises devices (wearables) located in the apparel,\
    \ on the\nbody, or under the skin, and are wirelessly connected. Even though tracking\
    \ physical\nconditions applies to diverse domains, including medical, social,\
    \ and economic ones, each\nwith its particular implications and extensive research\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the speciﬁc challenges\nof acquiring data in WBANs necessitated\
    \ new solutions designed for WBAN. Speciﬁcally,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n30 of\
    \ 44\nsince the sensors in WBANS are designed to be located close to the monitored\
    \ individual,\nthey impose particular challenges related to their speciﬁc structural,\
    \ functional, and size-\nrelated constraints. In the sequel, we dwell on some\
    \ of the most critical challenges and\nrecent promising results on WBANS. The\
    \ main objective of this survey is to understand the\ndata-gathering challenges.\
    \ In the special case of WBANS, we also elaborate on the sensors’\nphysical and\
    \ mechanical structure, which directly impact the data acquisition process.\n\
    Many of the challenges pertaining to WSN in general, which are described throughout\n\
    this survey, also apply to wearables. However, some of these challenges are exaggerated\n\
    when applied to wearables due to their unique characteristics. For example, energy-related\n\
    challenges that are essential to address and substantially inﬂuence any WSN design\
    \ and\nperformance, open a different perspective on wearables. Speciﬁcally, due\
    \ to their sensing\ndevices’ tiny size, the energy storing capacities are limited.\
    \ Yet, many wearable applications,\nparticularly healthcare ones, employ continuous\
    \ sampling and communication tasks that\nconstantly consume energy and deplete\
    \ the device’s battery. Frequent battery replacement,\nwhich can be a burden in\
    \ any WSN, can be even more cumbersome in wearables and can\nhinder the adoption\
    \ of these technologies (e.g., when the wearables are implants, battery\nreplacement\
    \ can involve an invasive medical intervention). Accordingly, energy-efﬁcient\n\
    approaches designed for wearable sensor networks are important for disseminating\
    \ the\ntechnology into additional domains. An inclusive review of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ approaches\ndesigned for human context recognition (HCR) based on wearable sensor\
    \ networks is\ngiven by [192]. This paper classiﬁes energy-efﬁcient mechanisms\
    \ for health-related HCR\napplications, based on the task that the mechanism is\
    \ aimed at to reduce its energy con-\nsumption (e.g., sensing, communication,\
    \ computation). The paper reviews the related\nworks according to the classiﬁcation.\n\
    6.1. Energy Harvesting (EH)\nEnergy harvesting as a battery alternative has been\
    \ discussed in Section 5.2. However,\nEH in the context of wearables encounters\
    \ new challenges, such as critical reliability level,\nexpected tiny size and\
    \ position in/on the human body, limited exposure to energy sources\nsuch as solar\
    \ energy, and so on. Accordingly, we revisit EH and review some EH studies\nin\
    \ the context of wearables. The three most prominent techniques include photovoltaic\n\
    cells attached to a wearable (energy is accumulated from environmental illumination),\n\
    thermoelectric nanogenerators (the energy source is the heat produced by the human\
    \ body),\nand kinetic energy harvesters (energy is created by natural body motion).\
    \ All energy\nharvesting cases pose a fundamental challenge of effective energy\
    \ management, which\ninvolves continuous decision making regarding how much energy\
    \ to spend on sensing,\nmeasurements, on-board classiﬁcation, and transmission\
    \ (see also Section 5.2).\nWe present examples for each of the techniques mentioned\
    \ above in the context\nof wearables. Thermoelectric energy-harvesting units exploiting\
    \ self-generated human\nheat are suggested to be fabricated straight into the\
    \ textile of the garments [193]. Energy\nharvesting for activity-aware wearables\
    \ is designed by Khalifa et al. [194]. The idea is to\nremove the accelerometers,\
    \ which consume about 80% of the battery. Instead, the authors\npropose to employ\
    \ kinetic energy harvesters, which will convert human motion into\nelectrical\
    \ power. Additionally, to compensate for the accelerometers’ removal, the input\
    \ and\noutput of the kinetic energy harvester would be analyzed by a specialized\
    \ activity classiﬁer\nto track and identify the human activity (i.e., to perform\
    \ the primary task of the wearable).\nLight-based energy-harvesting wearables\
    \ are discussed by Park et al. [195]. It is noteworthy\nthat as the available\
    \ luminosity can be highly unpredictable, the overall functioning, data-\ngathering,\
    \ and transmission process would imply an optimization problem. Henceforth,\n\
    the same authors suggest a protocol to optimize the number and accuracy of interpretation\n\
    of human gestures by an energy-harvesting wearable device under an energy budget,\n\
    Park et al. [196]. To this end, they constructed an analytical model that characterizes\n\
    energy consumption based on experimental data and formulized the optimization\
    \ problem.\nEsteves et al. [197] suggest incorporating energy harvesting as part\
    \ of MAC 802.15.6. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n31 of 44\nproposed MAC modiﬁcation\
    \ includes the usage of some body sensors as relays. The\nmanaging part at a hub\
    \ (e.g., a smartphone) sets the optimal relay charging times to\nperform the data\
    \ transmission by relay effectively. A source and the relays send their\nenergy-harvesting\
    \ updates within the request for cooperation (RFC) packets. The charging\ntimes\
    \ are calculated according to the amount of energy at the source and relays and\
    \ are\nupdated in accordance with previous packet transmission success or failure.\n\
    6.2. Technological Advances\nWBAN utilization is penetrating new domains, spanning\
    \ a wide variety of sensors,\neach providing a different aspect of the monitored\
    \ subject. For example, healthcare ap-\nplications are expected to provide a wide\
    \ span of indicators from various physiological\nparameters. Speciﬁcally, to provide\
    \ a comprehensive status of the examinee, it requires, in\naddition to the standard\
    \ indicators such as heart rate and physical activity that many of us\nalready\
    \ have integrated in our watch, information at a deeper level and molecular level\n\
    insight into the dynamics of the wearer.\nTo cope with the growing popularity\
    \ of wearables and their expansion to a broader\nscope of applications, especially\
    \ in healthcare systems, with the increasing demand to\nimprove quality of service\
    \ (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE), a new generation of\nwearables has emerged.\
    \ This generation relies on several technological advances in both\nthe device\
    \ and cloud realms. The novel device technology utilizes new soft-sensing tech-\n\
    nologies, including innovative wearable materials such as conducting polymers,\
    \ rigid\nforms of hydrogel, gold and silver nanowires (to create nanowired tattoos\
    \ as stretchable\nsensors), carbon nanotubes, liquid metals, ionic liquids, and\
    \ others. These materials give\nrise to novel sensor families, such as electro-physiological\
    \ (acting on the electric potential\ndifference) physical and chemical sensors.\
    \ See the latest advances in the following related\nworks [198–200]. For example,\
    \ besides reviewing the key developments in sweat-sensing\ntechnology, Bariya\
    \ et al. [198] examine the requirements of the underlying components\nembedded\
    \ in sweat-based wearable sensors and discuss challenges for integrating wearable\n\
    sweat sensors in the development of personalized healthcare. Sweat-sensing technology\n\
    has been described earlier; see, for example, Salvo et al. [201], where a device\
    \ containing\ntwo humidity sensors located at different heights from the skin\
    \ is designed in a way that\nallows one to measure the sweat rate by the difference\
    \ in readings of these two sensing\nsub-units. Thermal comfort control by calculating\
    \ the relation between the vapor pres-\nsure and the temperature is designed into\
    \ watch-type sweat sensors by Sim et al. [202].\nSweat measurement by sweat biomarkers\
    \ (in particular, pH and Na+) is implemented\nby Song et al. [203]. In short,\
    \ the biomarkers cause a change in electric potential near the\nmeasuring device,\
    \ allowing for accurate sweat measurement during physical activity. The\nauthors\
    \ also note that the change in electrical potential allows for energy harvesting,\
    \ which\ncan be effectively managed to self-power the device and thus allow for\
    \ a battery-free design.\nIn general, the material imprinted into the working\
    \ reacting electrode determines which\nsubstance (i.e., a chemical component present\
    \ in the sweat) it will react with. For example,\nan application of electrochemical\
    \ differential pulse voltammetry to sense the sweat to\nmeasure the level of caffeine\
    \ is devised by Tai et al. [204].\nThe main challenge in the devices is to implement\
    \ capabilities of effective data gath-\nering, ﬁltering, and transmission within\
    \ microscopic computing units. Some biometric\nsensing (especially made by speciﬁc\
    \ conﬁgurations of adjacent sensor sets) produces large\namounts of data (as in\
    \ ECG sensing) that should undergo an appropriate local density\nreduction. To\
    \ ensure conformity with the sensing devices, paper lithium batteries are\nproposed\
    \ (see, e.g., [205]). In addition, many sensors are conﬁgured only to transmit\n\
    following special hazards. For example, ECG sensors should trigger an alarm in\
    \ case the\nheartbeat is abnormal. This local data processing is a preliminary\
    \ phase that facilitates\nthe more intensive data analyses in the intermediate\
    \ data collection unit (the smartphone),\nand ﬁnally, the destination server.\
    \ To treat noisiness and variability (if the sensor sampling\nfrequency is too\
    \ high) of raw data from an accelerometer or gyroscope or loss of data (if the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n32 of 44\nsensor sampling frequency is too low), variable\
    \ sampling is proposed by Li et al. [206]. The\nofﬂine ML classiﬁcation algorithm\
    \ is used to identify and predict the physical activity.\nThe recent development\
    \ of miniature sensors combined with minimization of battery\nsize and energy\
    \ harvesting advances is sometimes referred to as a new paradigm, known as\nWearables\
    \ 2. For example, Ling et al. [207] provide a detailed description of various\
    \ types\nof sensors, means of attaching them to the human body, multiple parameters\
    \ the sensors\nare capable of measuring, and techniques to communicate and process\
    \ the measured data.\n6.3. Transmission Protocols\nWe note that while many of\
    \ the works mentioned above employ a smartphone device\nwith an application that\
    \ is presumably tailored to receive data from the wearables, having\na dedicated\
    \ hardware device that would ofﬂoad some of the networking burden (e.g.,\npotential\
    \ simpliﬁcation of the packetizing process) of the sensors would be more effective\n\
    and reliable. Indeed, in Pathak et al. [208], a central processing hub allows\
    \ one to circumvent\nthe cumbersome processes of sensor identiﬁcation, sensor\
    \ joining, and reconﬁguration\nby providing a designated interface. The authors\
    \ provide real hardware implementation,\nexplore various performance metrics,\
    \ and provide energy measurements.\nSeveral available protocols for data transmission\
    \ are suitable for WBAN. We mention\nhere the low Bluetooth energy (BLE; see,\
    \ e.g., Townsend et al. [209] for a detailed protocol\nstack description and Gomez\
    \ et al. [210] for performance evaluation and comparison with\nordinary Bluetooth\
    \ and other protocols). For distances of several centimeters, near-ﬁeld\ncommunication\
    \ (NFC) protocol (see Coskun et al. [211] for the theory and Kim et al. [212]\n\
    for a description of possible device designs and applications). Details of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.6\nstandard, which covers WBAN, can be found in, for example, Kwak\
    \ et al. [213]. One sees\ntherein how the human body communications PHY layer\
    \ in particular is deﬁned.\n6.4. WBAN Applications\nEven though, as stated earlier,\
    \ there is no intention to provide a thorough review of\nWBAN applications, we\
    \ mention several interesting ones. Monitoring of workers involved\nin extreme\
    \ conditions or whose activity can be potentially dangerous (e.g., Lee et al.\
    \ [214])\nsuggest wearable sensors for monitoring miners or construction professionals.\
    \ This study\nevaluates integrated wearable sensors for measuring construction\
    \ workers’ personal level\nof workload, individual factors, and physiological\
    \ reactions during rooﬁng activities. A\nfatigue detection system for car drivers\
    \ by Chang et al. [215] includes smart glasses, which\nare able to identify possible\
    \ drowsiness by an IR detector aimed at the driver’s eyes,\nequipped with BLE\
    \ transmitter. A small processor embedded into the glasses gathers and\npre-analyzes\
    \ the data and then transmits them to the on-board computer in the car. The\n\
    latter makes a decision about whether to issue a fatigue warning and sends it\
    \ to the cloud.\nWearables can be attached to a human body in order to sense the\
    \ environment for the safety\nof the carrier, as in Wu et al. [216]. The data\
    \ (humidity and temperature) is then transmitted\nto a mobile unit, where it can\
    \ be analyzed locally or further transmitted to the cloud in order\nto issue timely\
    \ warnings. Classiﬁcation of sports activity is implemented and validated by\n\
    experiments by Qi et al. [217], where the activity is identiﬁed from accelerometer\
    \ and ECG\nmeasurements done by chest and wrist sensors. The measurements are\
    \ transmitted to a\nsmartphone, which performs the data processing. SVM is employed\
    \ for the classiﬁcation.\nYou et al. [218] suggest a real-time wireless body sensor\
    \ networks (WBSNs) scheme\nfor welfare assessment and disease monitoring, prevention,\
    \ and treatment. The suggested\nscheme is composed of three components: sensing,\
    \ communication, and management.\nSensing attains a set of physiological parameters,\
    \ such as heart rate, body temperature,\nECG, temperature, blood pressure, blood\
    \ glucose, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, from\ndesignated sensors embedded\
    \ on a smart shirt worn by the monitored user. Communi-\ncation handles the processes\
    \ of delivering the sensed physiological data and controlling\ninstructions to\
    \ a backend server through wireless networks. The transmission protocols\ncan\
    \ be divided into two segments: the transfer of information from the sensors to\
    \ a central\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n33 of 44\nterminal located at a smartphone\
    \ and the transfer of information between the smartphone\nand the designated server,\
    \ which is located on the healthcare cloud. The communication\nrelies on multiple\
    \ communication protocols including Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G (which\ncan be\
    \ replaced by 5G where available). Management is responsible for collecting, classify-\n\
    ing, and monitoring the physiological data, and furthermore, being able to issue\
    \ warning\nmessages to medical professionals or caregivers whenever the physiological\
    \ data are ab-\nnormal. Additional applications utilizing data gathering can be\
    \ found in the following\nsurvey [219].\nWe conclude by emphasizing that the beneﬁts\
    \ of WBANs have not run their course\nyet. The development of data gathering will\
    \ jointly progress with the ongoing advances\nin sensor construction and manufacturing\
    \ capability, development, and standardization\nof Wearables 2 and beyond. Development\
    \ of specialized post-processing platforms poses\na specialized challenge, and\
    \ the urge to make progress in this area is acute. To illustrate\nthis, on account\
    \ of an ever-growing population, specialized platforms for elderly care\nare needed;\
    \ see, for example, the recent papers [220,221] about wearables designated for\n\
    elderly patients and references therein.\nFinally, wearables have been recently\
    \ harnessed for combating the COVID-19 disease.\nEarly identiﬁcation of COVID-19\
    \ symptoms by evaluating the resting heart rate during the\nasymptomatic (presumably\
    \ infectious) period and analysis by a deep learning framework\nis evaluated by\
    \ Bogu and Snyder [222]. While the precision of such a tool is clearly inferior\n\
    to the standard medical assays, it may be useful to provide a preliminary alert\
    \ for the\nearly onset of the disease for people in risk groups. Hassantabar et\
    \ al. [223] suggest a\nframework termed CovidDeep that combines commercially available\
    \ wearable physiolog-\nical feature sensors (WMSs) and a simple yes/no questionnaire\
    \ with efﬁcient DNNs for\npervasive large-scale monitoring of disease onset and\
    \ health condition. The automatically\nextracted raw data and medical background\
    \ and symptom responses are combined with\nsynthetically generated data to train\
    \ the DNN architecture. Grow-and-prune synthesis is\nused to generate accurate\
    \ and computationally efﬁcient models that can be deployed for\nCOVID-19 inference.\n\
    Since viruses can spread between people who are in close contact with an infected\n\
    person, and since infected people may be asymptomatic, the pandemic taught us\
    \ that it\nis best to keep a safe distance from others (see, for example, Cortellessa\
    \ et al. [224] for\nclose-proximity risk assessment for COVID infection). Accordingly,\
    \ most health institutions\nrecommend keeping physical distance between people\
    \ in public places (commonly termed\nas ”social distancing”) in order to stop\
    \ the pandemic from spreading. Furthermore, people\nwho were in the proximity\
    \ of an infected person (tested positive for COVID) are encouraged\nto be examined,\
    \ and several governmental regulations even require such people to stay in\nquarantine.\
    \ Several recent studies have suggested leveraging wearables for contact tracing\n\
    in order to identify the hazard from close proximity. For example, Ng et al. [225]\
    \ focus on\nBluetooth low energy and discuss the different data ﬂow approaches\
    \ and the accuracy of\nsmartphone vs. smartwatch applications in proximity detection.\
    \ Bian et al. [226] utilize\nwearables to monitor social distancing as recommended\
    \ for preventing COVID-19 spread.\nIn particular, the authors design compact potentially\
    \ wearable oscillating-magnetic-ﬁeld-\nbased proximity-sensing prototype systems\
    \ suitable for the relevant safety distance and able\nto track social distancing\
    \ much more reliably than the current Bluetooth-based smartphone\ntechnology.\
    \ Shubina et al. [227] provide a brief technical overview of the main contact-\n\
    tracing approaches and the challenges they impose on wearable technology. The\
    \ paper\nalso provides a short overview of the existing solutions deployed for\
    \ contact tracing and a\ndiscussion on the potential effect of wearables in tackling\
    \ the spread of a highly contagious\nvirus. More works from the past year discuss\
    \ the use of wearables for remote management\nand automated assessment of COVID-19.\
    \ Amft et al. [228] provide an overview of insti-\ntutional initiatives and alternative,\
    \ more accurate technologies for detection of infection\nsymptoms and possible\
    \ contact with infected individuals. Channa et al. [229] is a system-\nSensors\

    \ sensors and their clinical utilization\nin screening and contact tracing.\n\
    7. Concluding Remarks\nData gathering in modern WSN and IoT networks encompasses\
    \ many challenges,\nwhich span the entire communication stack. Many techniques,\
    \ protocols, and solutions\nhave been proposed over the years, but as technology\
    \ advances, new challenges and new\nopportunities arise. In this survey, we reviewed\
    \ these main challenges and opportunities, as\nwell as recent advances, and related\
    \ them to speciﬁc data-gathering research domains. We\nprovided a comprehensive\
    \ state-of-the-art data-gathering literature review in modern WSN\nnetworks, distinguishing\
    \ between the communication layers and the research domain.\nWe ﬁrst summarized\
    \ general architectural novelties and emerging architectures. We\nreviewed several\
    \ new technological advances and their inﬂuence on sensing device design,\nthe\
    \ platform carrying it, and the transceiver. We reviewed the effect of these architectural\n\
    advantages on speciﬁc applications, such as agriculture, smart cities, smart homes.\
    \ We\nshowed how cloud computing drives new WSN types, which introduces new directions,\n\
    and discussed how WSN can coexist within social network domains. Compressed sensing\n\
    was summarized next. We provided an overview of this important scheme and reviewed\n\
    its utilization in WSNs. We proceeded with the MAC layer. Since the performance\
    \ of many\ninnovations in the higher layers rely on the underlay MAC protocol\
    \ and since many data\ngathering schemes utilize traditional WSN MAC protocols,\
    \ we provided an overview of\nthese traditional protocols and mentioned state-of-the-art\
    \ works in WSN and IoT. These\nworks devise new MAC approaches for data gathering.\
    \ Next, we covered the recent\nadvances in routing. Similarly, we opened with\
    \ an overview of the traditional routing\nprotocols utilized for data-gathering\
    \ and reviewed several recent enhancements. We\nreviewed the utilization of network\
    \ coding for data gathering and explored the facilitation\nof UAV and mobile-sink\
    \ in collecting the data from the sensors. Lastly, we turned our\nattention to\
    \ the area of wearables which opens new research horizons for human health and\n\
    activity surveillance and discussed the new paradigm of Wireless Body Area Networks.\
    \ In\nthe spirit of the times, we concluded with several studies that utilize\
    \ some of the techniques\ndiscussed in this survey to aid in combating the COVID\
    \ pandemic.\nWhile we provided the general background to the research areas we\
    \ covered, we\nmainly focused on cutting-edge research works. Yet we note that\
    \ even seemingly exhausted\ntopics, such as MAC and Routing protocols, provide\
    \ new technological developments and\npresent opportunities for new research domains.\n\
    As implied throughout this survey, there are several research areas that attract\
    \ a\nlot of attention and anticipation for future developments. For example, technological\n\
    innovations in manufacturing more compact sensing units with yet superior transmission,\n\
    reception and processing capabilities are extremely in demand in several disciplines\
    \ which\ninclude wearables, smart homes, IoT-related domains and others. All the\
    \ more so, this\nis relevant when dealing with healthcare applications and implants.\
    \ Such technological\ninnovations will require in turn enhancements to other domains\
    \ across the communication\nstack in order to adjust to the new opportunities\
    \ and limitations. Energy acquisition is\nstill a fruitful research domain. In\
    \ this respect, ﬁnding new sources of energy harvesting\n(EH), better utilization\
    \ of existing energy resources and energy storage are still challenging\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds. Similarly, new EH methods impose multiple new challenges on the entire\n\
    protocol stack, which are correlated with the EH method, e.g., different EH methods\
    \ dictate\nconstraints on the MAC design, which in turn, impact the routing protocol\
    \ which affects\nthe performance end eventually the application utilizing the\
    \ infrastructure. The growth of\nsuch networks supporting a variety of heterogeneous\
    \ devices of communication standards\nand their increasing density requires more\
    \ effective data compression techniques and\nefﬁcient on-grid data analyses (i.e.,\
    \ even prior to data delivery to sinks). On the off-grid\nside of WSNs, we note\
    \ that consistent progress in Cloud Computing (CC) technology and\nexploitation\
    \ methodology will open new horizons in data analysis.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    35 of 44\nDeployment of Edge Computing units cooperating with sensing-capable\
    \ units will\nimply the development of novel data-gathering schemes. As WSN density\
    \ increases,\nchallenges in the gathering of useful data by WSN and its consequent\
    \ analysis will coincide\nwith those of Big Data. Clearly, the processes of such\
    \ analyses should be implemented\nwithin Cloud Computing systems. The fashion\
    \ of the CC physical resources deployed in\norder to efﬁciently interact with\
    \ WSN is not necessarily similar to those of usual IT-to-CC\nconnectivity. It\
    \ is not currently properly standardized and, most importantly, it is not\nclear\
    \ how correctly CC (e.g., which HW, correct deployment of Access Points) should\
    \ be\ncross-planned with a particular WSN. Issues of security and privacy which\
    \ are not covered\nin this survey will continue to elicit a major interest, especially\
    \ in keeping with evolving\nhealth care applications. The growth of the network\
    \ and their variability will require a\ngreater measure of adoption of ML and\
    \ AI methods and the development of such new\nspecialized methods for WSN in the\
    \ very near future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConﬂicts\

    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n2 of 63\nfor computation and IoT data storage [5].\
    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    \ process is automatically performed using searching on\npopular academic databases\
    \ such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer, Science Direct,\nSAGE, and Google\
    \ Scholar. The following search string was deﬁned by adding other\nspellings of\

    \ to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected\
    \ for the\nreview. Consequently, 240 articles were selected.\nIn the third stage\
    \ of eliminating the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment\nChecklist (QAC)\
    \ based on [13] was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the\ninitial\
    \ search were reﬁned. After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated\
    \ articles.\nThe entire body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which\
    \ were not related to\nour concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating\
    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\
    to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and\
    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc lights.\nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to\
    \ increase their intelli-\ngence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability.\
    \ CPS systems are integrated into water\nnetworks to add smart characteristics\
    \ to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering\nearly warning systems\
    \ to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For\ninstance,\
    \ it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be\n\
    implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].\n\
    WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides\n\
    well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level\
    \ in green-\nhouses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry\
    \ to automate, control,\nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23].\
    \ Finally, smart-healthcare systems\nbased on edge computing [24] are proposed\
    \ to monitor and examine the physical health of\nusers [25].\nFigure 2 shows some\
    \ important applications including smart trafﬁc surveillance\nand management,\
    \ smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste\nmanagement,\
    \ smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.\n \n\
    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\
    \ lights. \nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase\
    \ their intel-\nligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems\
    \ are integrated into \nwater networks to add smart characteristics to the processes\
    \ of water distribution [19]. \nOffering early warning systems to identify problems\
    \ in water networks is one of these \nduties. For instance, it is simple to identify\
    \ leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes \ncan be implemented to prevent\
    \ water wastage and future network threats or damage \n[20]. \nWSN-based monitoring\
    \ of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides \nwell-organized control\
    \ for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-\nhouses [21].\
    \ Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,\
    \ \nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare\
    \ sys-\ntems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine\
    \ the physical \nhealth of users [25]. \nFigure 2 shows some important applications\
    \ including smart traffic surveillance and \nmanagement, smart healthcare, weather\
    \ and air quality monitoring, smart waste man-\nagement, smart street lighting,\
    \ smart emergency response system, and smart home. \n \nFigure 2. Facilitating\
    \ networking and communication amongst SCAs.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n6 of\
    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\

    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\

    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\

    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\

    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\

    \ IoT and BI stakeholders\nmust make a concerted effort to give modern BI access\
    \ to a generic IoT framework with\ncognitive intelligence and context-aware computing\
    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    20, 7163. Copy Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that
    IoT, cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

    Ubiquitous technology, big data, more eﬃcient electronic health records, and predictive
    analytics are now at the core of smart

    healthcare systems supported by artiﬁcial intelligence. In the present narrative
    review, we focus on sensing technologies for

    the healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We employed a framework inspired by the
    Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory

    (IPNB), which posits that human experience is characterized by a ﬂow of energy
    and information both within us (within

    our whole body), and between us (in the connections we have with others and with
    nature). In line with this framework,

    we focused on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sensors such
    as implantable sensors, epidermal sensors,

    and wearable and portable sensors), human social interaction (sociometric sensors),
    and the physical environment (indoor

    and outdoor ambient sensors). There is a myriad of man-made sensors as well as
    nature-based sensors such as plants that

    can be used to design and deploy intelligent systems for human monitoring and
    healthcare. In conclusion, sensing

    technologies and intelligent systems can be employed for smarter healthcare of
    AN and help to relieve the burden of

    health professionals. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmental
    sustainability issues that must be considered

    prior to implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of professionals and
    other members of the society involved in

    the healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the development of these systems.
    The evolution of cyberphysical

    systems should also be considered in these collaborations.

    1. Introduction

    Ubiquitous technology, big data, more eﬃcient electronic

    health records, and predictive analytics are now at the core

    of smart healthcare systems supported byartiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) [1]. Particularly, the advances in health informatics and

    sensor technology provide several possibilities for a positive

    transformation of traditional medical treatments. For exam-

    ple, intelligent systems can provide real-time feedback to elec-

    tronic devices, the patient, and the physician to improve the

    eﬃciency in healthcare, reduce costs, relieve the burden of

    health professionals, and more importantly, to enhance

    human decision making, allowing better and more informed

    medical decisions for an optimal treatment [2]. In the present

    narrative review, we focus on sensing technologies for the

    healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Although AN is among

    the least common mental disorders, AN aﬀects approximately

    13.6 million people [95% UI: 10.2–17.5 million], mostly

    women, and accounts for the most deaths among eating disor-

    ders [3–5]. Moreover, the illness course in AN is usually a pro-

    tracted course that can develop into a severe-enduring

    condition with detrimental eﬀects in the health of millions of

    women [6, 7].

    Instead of a deep dive into the technical aspects of sensor

    technology, which is not our area of competence, we provide

    an overview of sensing technologies for researchers and

    Hindawi

    health professionals in the ﬁeld of eating disorders. Those

    interested to further explore this technology can use the

    extensive list of bibliographic references used to elaborate

    this manuscript.

    This study is divided into two major sections. In the ﬁrst

    section, we introduce sensor technology and the framework

    we will use to group the large diversity of sensors. This ﬁrst

    section covers body sensors (implantable, epidermal, wear-

    able, and portable), sociometric sensors, and ambient sen-

    sors.

    The

    second

    section

    is

    dedicated

    to

    the

    implementation

    of

    intelligent

    systems

    for

    smarter

    healthcare.

    1.1. Sensor Technology. In general terms, sensors capture and

    quantify physical phenomena such as temperature [8, 9].

    There is a myriad of sensors for various ﬁelds such as aero-

    space

    technology,

    agriculture,

    food

    packaging,

    and

    healthcare, among many others. For example, conventional

    electrochemical biosensors can detect bioﬂuids in the human

    body like lactate [10]. More advanced biosensors, based on

    quantum mechanics and nanomaterials (e.g., polymer, gra-

    phene, carbon), can detect neurotransmitters like dopamine

    or serotonin [11–17]. For example, quantum sensors can be

    used to detect photons or electromagnetic ﬁelds at the

    atomic level, allowing the detection of neural activity [9].

    Therefore, to explore the applications of sensors for the

    healthcare of AN, we employed a framework inspired by

    Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory (IPNB) [18]. IPNB

    posits that human experience is characterized by a ﬂow of

    energy and information both within us (within our whole

    body), and between us (in the connections we have with

    others and with nature) [18]. In this regard, what we call

    mind, would be “the emergent, self-organizing, embodied,

    and relational process that regulates the ﬂow of energy and

    information” [18(p. 4)]. In line with this framework, we focus

    on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sen-

    sors), human social interaction (sociometrics), and the phys-

    ical environment.

    1.1.1. Body Sensors. Body sensors can be further divided into

    diﬀerent categories. In this review, we categorize them as

    implantable (injectable, insertable, or ingestible), epidermal

    (skin-attached), and wearable and portable [19].

    (1) Implantable Sensors. The cardiac pacemaker developed

    in the 1960s is an illustrative example of one of the ﬁrst

    implantable sensors [19]. Novel heart monitoring devices

    include Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT; Car-

    dioNet, Inc.), Reveal LINQ (Medtronic), and Implantable

    Cardioverter Deﬁbrillators (ICDs) such as Visia AF devices

    (Medtronic) for the management of tachyarrhythmia. Car-

    diovascular issues in AN are widely recognized and “are

    the main cause of morbidity and mortality in AN” [20].

    Studies report elevated heart rate variability (HRV), brady-

    cardia, and QT interval prolongation (that is, from the Q

    wave to the end of the T wave in an electrocardiogram),

    the latter two associated with the development of ventricular

    arrhythmias [20, 21].

    In this regard, a recent study reported a sensor capable of

    providing interoceptive stimulation to enhance HRV [22].

    Interoception deﬁcits (i.e., the diﬃculty to accurately iden-

    tify internal physiological signals like hunger or satiety),

    have been identiﬁed as a key symptom in network analysis

    of AN psychopathology [23]. Therefore, there is a venue

    for further research on the autonomic nervous system in

    AN [24] using sensing technology.

    Implantable sensors can also be used for neural sensing

    (e.g., brain neural recording), intracranial neurostimulation

    (invasive deep brain stimulation, DBS), neuromodulation,

    and neurofeedback [25–36]. The neuroanatomical areas of

    major interest for the treatment of AN have been the brain’s

    subcallosal cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens

    [36–40]. Other reports include the dorsolateral prefrontal

    cortex (DLPFC) [26], the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis

    [41], and the ventral anterior limb of the capsula interna

    [42]. Most of these studies have focused on eating behavior

    and weight gain as indicators of successful outcomes [43],

    and much less on body image issues [e.g., 40]. First, it is

    important to recognize that weight gain is just one of many

    other important markers of a successful treatment outcome

    [33]. Second, it is also worth noting the caveats of imple-

    menting intracranial sensors (e.g., undergoing neurosurgery,

    using durable and ﬂexible biocompatible materials, cytotox-

    icity) [34], and most importantly the ethical concerns that

    can generate these interventions [44, 45].

    Implantable brain sensing technologies have raised

    many

    interests

    among

    scholars,

    health

    professionals,

    patients, business companies, and the public through the

    media depiction of brain-computer interfaces [46]. How-

    ever, it has raised concerns about ethical issues related to

    the use and misuse of neurotechnologies [44, 47–55]. In this

    regard, it is important to consider both ethical issues and

    future directions, prior to adopting implantable neural

    devices and neurostimulation [56–58].

    Other than heart and brain sensors, there are also

    implantable biosensors for tracking diverse biochemical sub-

    stances and processes in the human body. There are several

    chemical substances of interest (biomarkers) for the treat-

    ment of AN. For example, individuals with AN commonly

    present an endocrine dysregulation associated with the

    hypothalamic-pituitary

    axis,

    and

    more

    precisely

    the

    hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the hypothalamic-

    pituitary-adrenal axis [59]. This endocrine dysregulation is

    associated with a series of symptoms in AN such as amenor-

    rhea and bone loss. Indeed, AN is usually associated with

    low bone mineral density and osteoporosis (i.e., skeletal fra-

    gility due to bone loss) [60]. In this regard, there are

    implantable biosensors for monitoring bone health [61]. In

    other words, biosensors can help monitor a series of bio-

    chemicals associated with this endocrine dysregulation,

    including adipokines and gut peptides related to energy bal-

    ance, hunger and satiety (e.g., Leptin, Ghrelin, Neuropeptide

    Y, Peptide YY), hormones related to the menstrual cycle,

    stress, sleep, and others (e.g., oxytocin, growth hormone,

    luteinizing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, pro-

    gesterone, testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, etc.), and even key

    processes such as the chronobiology of hormones [2, 62–66].

    2

    BioMed Research International

    Clearly, there are many possibilities to integrate implantable

    biosensors in the healthcare and treatment of AN. However,

    once again, it is important to evaluate the ethical trade-oﬀs.

    Implantable biosensors can also be used in the design of

    implantable drug delivery systems to release localized and

    controlled amounts of drugs [2]. Thus, a venue of interest

    for these biosensors is its use in the design of nanoscale drug

    delivery systems, such as plant-based nanotechnology (phy-

    tonanotechnology) for the delivery of herbal drugs [67, 68].

    For example, there is a “renaissance” in the interest for psy-

    chedelics like the nonsynthetic ayahuasca, psilocybin, mes-

    caline, peyote [69]. Studies have shown promising eﬀects of

    psychedelics on key evolved psychological mechanisms like

    cognitive ﬂexibility [70, 71]. Cognitive ﬂexibility (i.e., the

    ability to shift perspective to adapt to a changing environ-

    ment or a new habitat), and in a more general way, behavior

    ﬂexibility (e.g., to anticipate others’ actions and acting

    accordingly), have evolutive roots that allow developmental

    adaptation throughout life [72–74]. Individuals with AN dis-

    play lower cognitive ﬂexibility compared to healthy controls,

    although most suitable assessment tools are necessary to bet-

    ter explain this deﬁcit and diﬀerences [75–77]. Future stud-

    ies can evaluate the use of biosensors to design implantable

    drug delivery systems that employ psychedelics such as aya-

    huasca or psilocybin to enhance key adaptive psychological

    mechanisms like cognitive ﬂexibility in AN. A similar

    approach can be used in the design of nutrient delivery sys-

    tems to improve nutrient bioavailability [78] in individuals

    with AN.

    Other group of implantable biosensors are ingestible

    sensors for gastrointestinal monitoring [19, 79]. For exam-

    ple, the SmartPill motility testing system (Medtronic)

    includes a smart pill that travels through the gastrointestinal

    tract and a software that provides valuable sensor data such

    as gastric emptying time, colonic transit time, pH, tempera-

    ture, and pressure from the antrum and duodenum (https://

    www.medtronic.com/). Other smart pills have been designed

    to sample the gut microbiome [80]. Individuals with AN

    present a series of gastrointestinal complications including

    constipation and bloating, with decreased gastric motility

    and delayed gastric emptying as the most common underly-

    ing causes, although the causes of gastric dysmotility in AN

    require further research [81]. Regarding the gut microbiota,

    preliminary results suggest that further research is needed to

    better characterize the gut microbiome in AN [82–84].

    Future research can use ingestible sensors to monitor these

    gastrointestinal complications and provide a better proﬁle

    of the gut microbiome in AN.

    Finally, an emergent technology of implantable body

    sensing that is attracting the attention of scientists, inven-

    tors, and companies is smart dust, considered “the future

    of humans monitoring” [85]. Based on technologies such

    as

    complementary

    metal-oxide-semiconductor

    (CMOS)

    and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), a smart dust

    system can consist of thousands of sensor nodes or motes

    (below 100 μm of size and ultra-low powered), which can

    sense chemicals, light, magnetism, vibration, acceleration,

    and temperature [85]. For human monitoring, these sensor

    nodes can be inserted in the human body (e.g., by drinking

    water), and neural dust and body dust are probably the most

    relevant of these technologies for mental healthcare. Neural

    dust is expected to provide neural recording and neural

    stimulation [85–87]. However, the present size of these

    devices (at a millimeter scale) is still a limitation, and brain

    activity recording via neural dust is still at the conceptual

    and simulation level [85]. Similarly, body dust is expected

    to track key biochemical reaction pathways (i.e., metabolic

    pathways, signaling pathways) involved in human biological

    systems. Diﬀerent eﬀorts are being made to downscale the

    size of these sensors and turn them feasible to produce and

    use [88, 89]. This advancement in the miniaturization of

    sensing technologies coupled with nanomaterials with out-

    standing properties (e.g., graphene composites), optoelec-

    tronics (i.e., using light for sensing, recording, stimulating,

    and controlling), and quantum sensing [9] for the develop-

    ment

    of

    optoneuroelectronic

    or

    optoelectrophysiology

    devices [87, 90] could also help bring innovations in this

    area.

    In the future, more individuals with AN could eventually

    beneﬁt from implantable sensing technology. However, it is

    important to highlight that the need to use these technolo-

    gies should be evaluated prior to its implementation in the

    treatment of AN. In the case they are approved, they should

    be used under strict regulation to accomplish ethical guide-

    lines and recommendations. Moreover, we suggest that

    implantable biosensors should not be used as a standalone

    device, but rather used as the ﬁrst layer of a smart healthcare

    system aimed to provide personalized care in the treatment

    of individuals with AN.

    (2) Epidermal Sensors. Most biosensors are usually mini-

    mally invasive and can monitor, for example, glucose levels

    [91]. This noninvasive approach is commonly employed to

    measure physiological signals like pulse or heart rate by

    attaching sensors to the skin [66]. These epidermal sensors

    are skin-inspired electronics typically ultrathin, soft, and

    stretchable, giving the appearance of a second skin or tattoo

    [10, 66, 92]. An example of this technology is the 5x5mm

    Lab-on-Skin sensing chip developed by Xsensio (https://

    xsensio.com), to track biomarkers in human sweat [93, 94].

    Similar soft and ﬂexible electrochemical bioelectronics have

    been developed with the appearance of a wristband or band

    aid to measure sweat samples [95, 96], wound pH [97],

    pulse, breath, and body movement [98], among others [10].

    Individuals with AN are known to present altered phys-

    iological responses to certain stimuli like high-calorie food

    (e.g., ice cream, pizza) [99] or images of human bodies

    (e.g., their own body, ultra-thin female bodies) [100]. There-

    fore, there are several opportunities to use epidermal sensors

    for the continuous measurement of various physiological

    responses in AN. For example, electrodermal activity

    (EDA) sensors to monitor skin conductance response (gal-

    vanic skin response), together with epidermal sensors of

    heart rate, and cortisol, can provide overall a continuous

    real-time measurement of stress levels, as it can be done with

    commercial devices [101]. However, it should be noted that

    epidermal

    sensors

    are

    commercially

    less

    developed

    3

    BioMed Research International

    compared with wearable commercial sensors that have been

    used more frequently [101, 102]. In any case it is important

    to highlight that both require a rigorous validation involving

    the preprocessing of raw data (e.g., noise reduction), signal

    processing, and feature extraction [103, 104].

    (3) Wearable and Portable Sensors. Perhaps the most famous

    sensors among consumers are wearable sensors such as

    smart watches and portable sensors such as smartphones

    that incorporate a camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, light

    detection, etc. The main diﬀerence between the epidermal

    sensors mentioned above and the wearable sensors men-

    tioned here, are that the former are ultrathin, soft, and ﬂex-

    ible skin-attached sensors, whereas the latter are commonly

    rigid and not exclusively used in contact with the skin.

    Examples of wearable and portable sensor devices include

    mobile

    electroencephalography

    (EEG),

    smart

    glasses

    (including eye-tracker glasses), smart contact lens (rigid,

    soft), helmet, headband, earring, earpiece, ﬁngertip, rigid

    wristband, belt, smart textiles (e.g., bra, shirt, sock), and fork

    [19]. As can be seen, there are diﬀerent wearable and porta-

    ble devices, but we will cover just three devices of interest for

    the healthcare and treatment of AN, prior to covering wear-

    able biosensors.

    The ﬁrst sensor of interest is the portable Sensing Fork

    designed by Kadomura et al. [105] as part of a mobile based

    system to promote healthy eating among children. What is

    interesting about this system is that it integrates several ele-

    ments of an intelligent system: a sensor, a gamiﬁed smart-

    phone application (app), a food type classiﬁer, an eating

    action classiﬁer, and feedback to the user [105]. A similar

    device, the HAPIfork, has been developed by the company

    Hapilabs (https://hapilabs.com).

    Mobile EEG sensors are commonly used as a brain-

    computer interface (BCI) to track brain neural activity

    [106, 107] and to provide neurofeedback in controlled set-

    tings [108, 109] or “in the wild” through mobile phone apps

    for consumers (e.g., the Muse headband). Although com-

    pared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it

    has a poorer spatial resolution, it has good temporal resolu-

    tion, it is portable, and inexpensive [110]. The United States

    has funded research on BCI through “the Defense Advanced

    Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research

    Lab, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and other organiza-

    tions” [111, 112]. Although most of the funding focused on

    neuroprosthetics for the treatment of patients with trau-

    matic brain injury, major limb amputation, among others;

    it had an enormous impact on the development of compa-

    nies interested in commercializing BCI-based solutions

    [113]. Among the most popular BCI devices, we have the

    open hardware OpenBCI, the Emotiv EPOC, the Muse

    headband, and the NeuroSky’s EEG biosensor.

    Eye-trackers are other well-known sensors used for var-

    ious purposes including research on advertising [114, 115],

    gender attitudes [116], body-related attentional bias [117],

    and eating disorders [118–121]. Although desktop eye-

    tracking devices are by far more precise, wearable eye-

    trackers provide descent resolution and sampling rates

    [122]. Popular eye-trackers include Pupil Labs glasses, Tobii

    glasses, SMI glasses, and low-cost solutions like Remo-

    teEye [123].

    Finally, wearable biosensors employ a biological recogni-

    tion element (receptor) and a transducer (e.g., electrode) to

    detect bioﬂuids [124, 125]. Biosensors can use diﬀerent

    receptors, such as enzymatic electrochemical biosensors to

    detect glucose, uric acid, lactate, and hydrogen peroxide;

    intact living cells to work as cell sensors and microbial sen-

    sors; antibodies to act as immunosensors; and even nucleic

    acids (e.g., aptamers) to recognize molecules [125]. There-

    fore, wearable biosensors can have diﬀerent functionality,

    such as detecting metabolic parameters (e.g., pH, electro-

    lytes), physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin tempera-

    ture), and even toxic chemicals like organophosphate

    compounds [126]. A recent review of electrochemical aﬃn-

    ity biosensors details a series of devices to detect hormones

    and metabolites that can be of relevance for the treatment

    of AN, like the aforementioned cortisol, leptin, ghrelin,

    growth hormone, estradiol, among others [65].

    Wearable biosensor devices worth mentioning include

    contact lenses and eyeglasses for tear biosensing [127, 128],

    the 61 x 41 x 5.5 mm VivaLINK (https://www.vivalink

    .com/) axillary patch to measure temperature, the 90 x 20

    x 7.9 mm cardiac patch from the same company, textile sen-

    sors (smart textile) for sweat analysis [129], to name just a

    few. In fact, the list of wearable biosensors and their applica-

    tions is so extensive that we refer the reader to previous work

    [19, 66, 103, 124, 126, 130–133].

    1.1.2. Sociometric Sensors. The quantity and quality of inter-

    personal relationships exert a strong inﬂuence in shaping the

    individual’s aﬀect, cognition, and behavior. Social network

    analysis has been used for a long time to study human social

    interaction

    [134].

    Traditional

    sociometric

    techniques

    employ self-reports about friendships and networks, provid-

    ing a valuable but limited view of human interactions [135].

    In this regard, computational science methods that include

    sensing technology, social physics, and simulations can pro-

    vide accurate measures of human social interaction and

    remarkably precise predictions of individual and collective

    human behavior [136, 137]. Therefore, in this group, we

    consider as a sociometric sensor any sensor (i.e., implant-

    able, epidermal, wearable, portable) that can provide rele-

    vant social data.

    For example, the growing adoption of 5G technology

    and pervasive wireless sensors in smart spaces (i.e., smart

    cities, smart organizations including smart hospitals, and

    smart homes) provide a ﬁne-grained collection of social sig-

    nals, allowing a continuous remote monitoring of human

    daily life activities and social interactions. In this scenario,

    sociometric sensor devices have been developed to provide

    accurate measures of interpersonal proximity and verbal

    communication [138–141]. Sociometric data collected by

    sensors in daily life settings can be used to examine peer pro-

    cesses and family processes in AN with the possibility to

    identify cliques (e.g., group of friends), inﬂuence agents in

    the network, and key communication and interaction pro-

    cesses known to shape social norms within groups [142].

    4

    BioMed Research International

    Similarly, sociometric sensors can be used to examine group

    interactions, communication, collaboration, and overall

    group dynamics [143] among healthcare professionals

    [144]. In sum, methodologies from computer science and

    social sciences (i.e., computational social sciences) can be

    employed for social data mining (e.g., using sociometric sen-

    sors), social signal processing [145], simulation (e.g., agent-

    based models), and interventions [146].

    1.1.3. Ambient Sensors. In this category, we basically have

    outdoor and indoor ambient sensors. Regarding outdoor

    sensors, many urban cities are equipped with environment-

    embedded sensors to measure physical conditions such as

    humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind for

    weather forecasting. In fact, there are several types of out-

    door sensors: soil moisture sensors for irrigation manage-

    ment; air quality sensors to track pollution; and city

    cameras, including thermal cameras and AI cameras, for

    security, traﬃc management, people counting, monitoring

    energy transformers to avoid overheating, etc.

    Along with these sensors, we have satellite data, location

    data, and a geographic information system (GIS) to, for

    example, map the surrounding built environment of citizens.

    Although all these data from ambient sensors and geoloca-

    tion apparently seem disparate, we can use computer vision,

    signal processing, simulation, machine learning and AI, to

    analyze a built environment, identify patterns like individual

    and group human behavior within cities, and predict future

    patterns [147].

    The built environment of a neighborhood has an impor-

    tant eﬀect on health behaviors. For example, built environ-

    ments can facilitate open air physical activity if they

    provide suitable infrastructure like walking paths [148]. Sim-

    ilarly, healthy food availability and accessibility in living sur-

    roundings can facilitate healthy eating [149]. Individuals

    with AN struggle with food and it could be even worse if

    the surrounding living environment does not provide

    healthy food choices (e.g., the so-called “food deserts”) or

    food that ﬁts a personally tailored nutrition [150, 151]. Fur-

    thermore, high levels of physical activity are common in

    individuals with AN [152, 153], and this overactivity has

    been linked to thermoregulation and ambient temperature

    [154], both of which can be measured with sensors.

    Therefore,

    environment-embedded

    sensors

    can

    be

    implemented in indoor and outdoor spaces to measure

    diverse conditions like temperature, ambient radio signals

    (e.g., Wi-Fi), air quality, location, etc. Then, we can integrate

    the information of the built environment that surrounds

    individuals with AN with the data of their indoor living con-

    ditions, into intelligent systems for healthcare monitoring.

    For example, weather forecasting data with previous individ-

    ual’s mobility and sleep patterns [155] could predict physical

    overactivity in outdoors in AN. An intelligent system that

    integrates this information together with real-time air qual-

    ity data [156] can send an SMS reminder to the user to avoid

    excessive exercise and reduce his exposure to air pollution,

    the latter linked to cardiovascular diseases [157, 158]. In a

    similar fashion, data from global positioning system (GPS)

    and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been used

    to monitor the food environment and food and eating pat-

    terns [159].

    As we will see below [160], there are many other oppor-

    tunities to integrate ambient sensors in intelligent systems

    for healthcare monitoring.

    1.2. Intelligent Systems. Intelligent systems for healthcare

    monitoring can be designed to relieve the burden of

    healthcare professionals, reduce costs, and improve the

    treatment of individuals with AN. In this regard, it is impor-

    tant to integrate sensor data with traditional data from the

    clinical history and physical examination, laboratory tests,

    self-reports, etc. For example, Figure 1 shows an intelligent

    system that employs machine learning models integrating

    sensor data and traditional data (e.g., self-reports) to provide

    feedback to the caregiver, physician, and patient.

    First, given that we can acquire data from multiple sen-

    sors, sensor fusion is recommended to enhance the quality

    of the data collected by the sensors [161]. For example, if

    the signal of a heart sensor is aﬀected by noise (e.g., move-

    ment), heart data from additional sensors can ensure the

    reliability of heart monitoring [161]. Similarly, sensor fusion

    can be used to obtain data that cannot be obtained by iso-

    lated sensor data [161].

    Then, the architecture to process these multisensor sen-

    sor data can be a decentralized distributed architecture

    [162, 163], like a network of nodes with a hierarchical struc-

    ture. For example, we can employ Wireless Sensor Networks

    (WSNs), which are networks of scattered wireless sensors to

    collect diverse physical data from the environment [164],

    together with Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) that

    comprise body sensors located in diﬀerent parts of the body

    [98, 161]. The ﬁrst layer in this hierarchy constitutes the

    edge computing layer that retrieves the data from body sen-

    sors, RFIDs, etc. These data are forwarded to a fog comput-

    ing layer (e.g., a Raspberry Pi, a smartphone), which acts as

    the connecting link between the edge layer and the cloud

    computing (the highest layer in this hierarchy), reducing

    latency and enhancing eﬃciency [165]. Finally, cloud com-

    puting can be leveraged to perform the most arduous tasks,

    including the use of artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g., graph neural

    networks) for classiﬁcation and predictive analytics.

    Although, the need to use cloud services should be eval-

    uated in terms of cybersecurity, privacy, conﬁdentiality, and

    environmental sustainability [162]. Moreover, improve-

    ments in radio technology (e.g., 6G standard, autonomous,

    dynamic, distributed, adaptive wireless networks), will allow

    more eﬃcient infrastructures depending less on remote

    cloud services. For example, Amazon Web Service (AWS)

    Wavelength (https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/features/)

    is a mobile edge computing infrastructure that embeds

    AWS services within 5G networks, reducing the need for

    mobile applications to heavily rely on remote cloud servers.

    There are several examples of a three-layer architecture

    for healthcare monitoring. Niu et al. [98] developed the

    bodyNET system that employs ﬁve wearable epidermal sen-

    sor nodes and smart textiles that operate with a smartphone

    via Bluetooth, and a cloud server via cellular network, for

    pulse detection, breath detection, and body movement

    5

    BioMed Research International

    detection. Similar systems have been used for tracking eating

    behavior [166] to predict heart failure [167, 168] and mental

    health issues such as depression [169].

    However, perhaps the most promising venue of intelli-

    gent systems in healthcare is to provide tailored interven-

    tions

    at

    real-time

    using

    mobile

    health

    (mHealth)

    technology, digital twin (e.g., a digital replica of a patient),

    social robotics, or others. That is the case of digital just-in-

    time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) or ecological momen-

    tary interventions [170–174] that can adopt a human-aware

    AI (or human-centered AI, i.e., AI systems that are centered

    on the user) approach [175] and a context-aware approach

    [168, 174]. In this case, these intelligent systems are

    grounded in both evidence-based interventions (e.g., behav-

    ior change theories) and continuous learning (e.g., reinforce-

    ment learning), to provide a user-friendly experience

    tailored to the needs of the user. For example, a JITAIs can

    be a gamiﬁed mobile app grounded in Cognitive Behavioral

    Therapy (CBT), and the mechanisms of behavior change

    [176, 177] that delivers reminders or instructions to support

    decision making, behavior change, activities of daily life, etc.

    These alerts can beneﬁt individuals with AN and those mon-

    itoring their treatment [170]. Sensing technologies can be

    key in designing these intelligent systems, and these systems

    can be integrated together with traditional interventions to

    provide a smarter healthcare in AN.

    2. Discussion

    This review focused on the integration of sensor technology

    and intelligent systems, to provide smarter healthcare deliv-

    ery systems in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Through this narra-

    tive review, we have seen that to design and deploy these

    intelligent systems, we require the eﬀort of professionals

    from diverse ﬁelds. Domain expertise in the ﬁeld of eating

    disorders, healthcare management, sensor technologies,

    internet of things (IoT), big data, data science, artiﬁcial intel-

    ligence is required, among others. However, global chal-

    lenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change,

    have demonstrated that the deployment of intelligent sys-

    tems is feasible through cooperation and consilience across

    diﬀerent disciplines, and it fosters innovation scaling [178].

    Current interventions that use technology, particularly

    mobile technology (i.e., mHealth interventions) for the treat-

    ment of eating disorders such as AN are scarce, but the use

    of evidence-based techniques, gamiﬁcation, and the possibil-

    ity of remote monitoring and guidance are just some of the

    factors that can make them attractive for patients and clini-

    cians [179–182]. Therefore, as we have seen previously, there

    are several opportunities to integrate sensing technology and

    foster innovation in the ﬁeld of eating disorders, particularly

    in healthcare settings. Anorexia Nervosa aﬀects the lives of

    millions of women and is a chronic condition that deserves

    the careful attention of health professionals but can create

    a burden among them. Sensing technologies can relieve this

    burden if they are used to not only provide data but also

    used particularly if they are embedded in intelligent systems

    for smarter healthcare of patients with eating disorders.

    In this regard, we highlight the fact that there is a fast

    development in the manufacture of new and low-cost elec-

    tronic devices, particularly in modern cities like Shenzhen

    (China). We have mentioned above that these new technol-

    ogies, like polymer and graphene composite-based nanosen-

    sors, quantum sensors, will be the future of human

    monitoring. As we also mentioned, there are ethical con-

    cerns that arise from ubiquitous technologies. However, we

    must also mention environmental and sustainability issues

    related to the manufacture of sensor technologies. For exam-

    ple, intelligent cameras with computer vision capabilities can

    be used for healthcare but require higher power consumption

    and materials like lithium or gold, that usually have high and

    hidden environmental costs. In summary, it is important to

    recognize along the ethical issues mentioned above, the envi-

    ronmental sustainability of the manufacture and use of these

    sensors. Future research should consider alternatives to man-

    made sensors, such as nature-based biosensors. For example,

    plants used as sensors (phytosensors), are a more sustainable

    alternative, have higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity, and can be

    used for human monitoring [183, 184].

    Finally, we have shown how sensor technologies can be

    integrated in the treatment of AN through the design and

    deployment of intelligent systems supported by artiﬁcial

    intelligence. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that there

    are established network standards (e.g., IEEE 802.15.6 for

    WBANs), device standards (e.g., IEEE/ISO 11073-10420-

    2010 for body composition analysis), and communication

    standards (e.g., Proxy Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 by the Internet

    Engineering Task Force, IETF) for these systems. However,

    to implement more advanced and future intelligent systems,

    we need to design new standards and protocols that require

    the collaboration and synergy of diﬀerent professionals. To

    give an example, there is a joint eﬀort to build cyberphysical

    social systems, which includes what is called Societies 5.0, a

    new paradigm to modeling and managing complex systems

    such as societies [185, 186]. The transition towards these

    cyberphysical social systems, and more particularly cyber-

    physical medical systems [187], urgently requires interdisci-

    plinary

    collaboration

    [188].

    For

    example,

    there

    are

    cybersecurity issues, like cyberattacks to healthcare devices

    [187], that can be solved with secured protocols and stan-

    dards [189, 190]. Importantly, cyberphysical social systems

    can be used for behavior monitoring [191], and therefore

    they have a great potential for smarter healthcare at the indi-

    vidual and population level.

    3. Conclusions

    In conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems

    can be designed and deployed for smarter healthcare for

    AN. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmen-

    tal sustainability issues that must be considered prior to

    implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of profes-

    sionals and other members of the society involved in the

    healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the develop-

    ment of these systems. The evolution of cyberphysical sys-

    tems should be considered in these collaborations.

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\
    tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in\
    \ many smart city domains, including healthcare,\ntransportation, the environment,\
    \ energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review\
    \ of PDS and its\napplications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain\
    \ of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current\nresearch status,\
    \ challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future\
    \ directions. The foremost aim of\nthis paper is to provide a detailed survey\
    \ of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers who want to explore this\
    \ ﬁeld; along\nwith the research opportunities in the domains.\nKeywords: Smart\
    \ city, Probabilistic Data Structure (PDS), Bloom Filter (BF), big data, Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)\n1. Introduction\nIn the early 1970s, it was a period of acceleration\
    \ in the ﬁeld of computing and data was the new term. There was\nan evolution\
    \ of relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are\
    \ clusters of unstructured,\nsemi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s,\
    \ there was slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary\ncities. Generally,\
    \ ordinary cities are deﬁned as human settlements without the use of the latest\
    \ technology at all.\nThe need for processing, storage, and analysis is required\
    \ beyond the human and technical infrastructure. This huge\nvolume and variety\
    \ of unstructured data and untapped information is spread across the networks.\
    \ The core part of\nApache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\
    \ consisting of the storage part, and the MapReduce\n*Corresponding author. E-mails:\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\
    \ individual performance 2.0, and 3.0 engagement. Smart City Genera-\n234\nM.\

    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ are widely\nused by various researchers in their design and development. These\
    \ are very useful for handling and storing large\namounts of data in an appropriate\
    \ and efﬁcient manner. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures\n\
    [246]. The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\
    \ testing, and cardinal counting. Low\nmemory requirements and good processing\
    \ speed are two distinct features of PDS [136].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n237\nFig. 5. Overview of PDS [246].\n6.1. Bloom\
    \ ﬁlter\nIn 1970, the concept of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H.\
    \ Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic\nmodel, a highly efﬁcient random data\
    \ structure. It is used to reduce space problems and is an effective way to query\n\
    the membership of any item in an extensive set. The BF consists of an array with\
    \ m-bits which is initialized to 0 and\nk hash functions. The hash function k\
    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\
    \ probability after querying that the element is in the set, but\nactually, it\
    \ is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the increase of\
    \ ﬁlter size, so there is a trade-off\nbetween storage and false-positive [82].\n\
    Properties of Quotient Filter:\n– An Approximate Member Query (AMQ) ﬁlter is used\
    \ to speed up the answers in the storage system.\n– Insertion, deletion, and updating\
    \ are allowed in QF, resulting in the large usage of proxy databases.\n– There\
    \ is no need to re-hash the original key for merging and re-sizing of QF.\nPDSs\
    \ are used in many real-time applications like preserving patient data in healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc control, energy-\nsaving, and also for SEM and SAM, and many more. In\
    \ the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart\ncities and big data\
    \ will be explored in a more detailed manner.\nFig. 9. Quotient ﬁlter [89].\n\

    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\
    \ a virtual power plant in smart grid etc.\nPeoples have a number of reasons like\
    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n245\nFig. 12. Status\
    \ ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11].\ndata in storage without\
    \ exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction, positive and negative\
    \ ﬁlters\nare used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system for infection control\
    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\
    \ after being involved in a serious\n254\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\

    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\
    \ The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\
    \ of this paper after reviewing related work, we have listed the exiting and scope\
    \ of PDS in various\napplications of smart cities in Table 7.\nTable 7\nDomain\

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\

    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\
    \ OR \"IoTA\" OR \"AIoT\" OR \"IoT based\nAgriculture Tools OR Appliance\" OR\

    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\
    \ \nPhysical Layer\nSensor                      Actuator                     \

    \ the network. The control\nlayer works as a decision maker and performs analysis\
    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\
    \ to the information [39]. The\n5\nTable 1: Comparision of Different IoTA Architectures\n\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\

    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    \ is essential for food security and economic stability. Unmanned\naerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV) imagery and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are valuable tools for it. The\
    \ purpose\nof this review is to gather several methods used by our peers recently,\
    \ hoping to provide some\nknowledge and assistance for researchers and farmers\
    \ so that they can employ these technologies\nmore advantageously. The studies\
    \ reviewed in this paper focused on Scab detection in Rosaceae\nfamily fruits.\
    \ Feature extraction, segmentation, and classiﬁcation methods for processing the\
    \ UAV-\nobtained images and detecting the diseases are discussed brieﬂy. The advantages\
    \ and limitations\nof diverse kinds of UAVs and imaging sensors are also explained.\
    \ The widely applied methods for\nimage analysis are machine learning (ML)-based\
    \ models, and the extensively used UAV platforms\nare rotary-wing UAVs. Recent\
    \ technologies that cope with challenges related to disease detection\nusing UAV\
    \ imagery are also detailed in this paper. Some challenging issues such as higher\
    \ costs,\nlimited batteries and ﬂying time, huge and complex data, low resolution,\
    \ and noisy images, etc.,\nstill require future consideration. The prime signiﬁcance\
    \ of this paper is to promote automation and\nuser-friendly technologies in Scab\
    \ detection.\nKeywords: Scab; Rosaceae fruits; disease detection; UAVs; artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI); machine\nlearning (ML)\n1. Introduction\nRosaceae fruits\
    \ are grown extensively and cultivated globally. Among Rosaceae family\nmembers,\
    \ apples, peaches, cherries, strawberries, avocadoes, and almonds, are produced\n\
    on a larger scale due to their higher nutritional values. The production of these\
    \ fruits is\nhighly inﬂuenced by pests and different diseases. Among these diseases,\
    \ the Scab is the\nmost acute fungal disease that infects the leaves as well as\
    \ the fruits. It is a threat that\nresults in inadequate quality and heavy wastage\
    \ of Rosaceae fruits. Serious considerations\nand accurate detection systems are\
    \ essential to detect this disease at the initial stages [1,2].\nRosaceae fruits\
    \ have abundant leaves that are observed to detect diseases and sustain\nproduction.\
    \ This observation requires automation through advanced technologies such\nas\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can\
    \ capture\nmultiple and enormous quantities of data, store images, reduce timely\
    \ processes, allow\nspraying on the required infected areas only, and so on. Similarly,\
    \ by using subdomains\nof AI, deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) algorithms,\
    \ healthy and infected\nleaves can be identiﬁed and classiﬁed with greater accuracy.\
    \ The studies reported in [3,4]\nemployed these technologies and detected Scab\
    \ disease with greater accuracies, resulting\nin sustainable production.\nBackground:\
    \ Earlier experts were hired for manual tree monitoring, foliage exami-\nnation,\
    \ and disease detection [5]. They were skilled in their domains and had complete\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones7020097\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n2 of 32\nawareness of the diseases and their treatments. However,\
    \ this manual diagnosis was\ntroublesome, error-subjective, less accurate, expensive,\
    \ time-consuming, labor-intensive,\nand required expertise. In the early 1960s,\
    \ mechanical laboratories, livestock variables, and\nfertilizer usage expanded\
    \ the scale of agricultural production. To improve detection efﬁ-\nciency, automatic\
    \ detection technology emerged as the times required. Automatic detection\nsystems\
    \ explored by AI techniques replaced manual work with mechanical work and gave\n\
    highly accurate disease detection in less time [6,7].\nRelated Work: Many studies\
    \ have employed AI techniques for Scab detection in\nRosaceae fruits. The outcomes\
    \ of their research show the signiﬁcance of applying DL\nand ML approaches for\
    \ feature extraction, image segmentation and classiﬁcation, and\nthe use of UAV\
    \ imagery. The analysis in [8] provides reviews on various remote sensing\ntechniques,\
    \ features, models, and algorithms to monitor pests, Scab, and other diseases\
    \ in\napples, peaches, and other plants. One study [9] suggests remote sensing\
    \ using UAVs for\ndetecting diseases and weeds, estimating the quality and production\
    \ of fruits, classifying\ntrees, etc. It concludes that UAVs serve as powerful\
    \ tools not only for site management but\nalso for individual tree management.\
    \ Analysis in [10] reviews current applications of UAV\nimaging for mapping and\
    \ detection of diseases, pests, and weeds. Research in [11] lists\nvarious Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices such as UAVs, sensors, and harvesting drones for\nagricultural\
    \ tasks. It describes the beneﬁts of these devices that dominate the barriers\
    \ to\ndisease detection and other agricultural tasks.\nThe study in [12] reviews\
    \ the previous work of numerous authors who describe\nthe use of hyperspectral\
    \ imaging to detect Scab and other diseases. The ﬁndings show\nthat using UAVs,\
    \ preprocessing of hyperspectral images, vegetation index, ML, and DL\nmethods\
    \ provide efﬁcient results for disease detection. Extensive literature on image\n\
    processing and ML techniques is given in [13]. The best results for Scab and various\n\
    disease detection, classiﬁcation, and other applications related to the Rosaceae\
    \ family and\nother fruits were obtained by using DL approaches. In [14], the\
    \ researchers applied a DL\nalgorithm and three classical ML algorithms to detect\
    \ Scab and other diseases in apples,\npeaches, cherries, and various fruits. The\
    \ results prove the dominance of the DL algorithm\nover ML algorithms in terms\
    \ of accuracy and simplicity. The study in [15] details challenges\nand trends\
    \ for Scab and other disease detection while applying DL techniques. It also\n\
    exhibits the signiﬁcance of using different sample sizes and hyperspectral imaging\
    \ for\ndetecting diseases at preliminary stages.\nMotivation and Contribution:\
    \ Agricultural researchers are adopting these advanced\ntechnologies and systems\
    \ for Scab detection. The motivation for this paper is to update\nthem concerning\
    \ these trending technologies, identify gaps in methodologies, and provide\ncomprehensive\
    \ knowledge on approaches for overseeing the gaps. We not only discuss\nrecent\
    \ challenges in using UAVs for disease detection, but also compare and gather\
    \ into\na single platform the novel AI approach employed by previous researchers.\
    \ Relevant\narticles from 2017 to 2022 are summarized for assisting farmers and\
    \ researchers. We used\nGoogle Scholar along with other scientiﬁc repositories:\
    \ ScienceDirect, SAGE Journals,\nSpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, and Wiley Online Library\
    \ Journal to search for relevant articles.\nThe search was conducted with a combination\

    Figure 1. Structure of the paper.\n2. State-of-the-Art in the Research Field\n\
    Automation and digitalization were increasingly adopted for monitoring purposes\
    \ in\nvarious sectors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\
    \ The automatic\ntechnologies obtained by combining AI techniques with UAVs resulted\
    \ in enhancing\nagricultural production [16]. This high-tech innovation is becoming\
    \ an integral part of\nnumerous research activities and is broadly enhancing the\
    \ agriculture sector. UAVs use\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology\
    \ for autonomous driving [17].\nBeing equipped with a camera or other sensors,\
    \ it identiﬁes obstacles, recognizes its position,\nand avoids collision with\
    \ other UAVs. These are boosted with improved communication\nand data-processing\
    \ speed. The widely applied categories of UAVs are ﬁxed-wing and\nrotary-wing.\
    \ Rotary-wing UAVs are further categorized into helicopters, quadcopters,\nhexacopters,\
    \ and octocopters [18]. These are becoming more efﬁcient, dependable, and\nrobust\
    \ tools in detecting diseases at their initial stages and for spraying fungicides.\
    \ Being\nequipped with sensors, UAVs are highly effective in disease assessment\
    \ [19]. These detect\ndiseases, allow correct decision-making, and apply appropriate\
    \ control measures. UAVs\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n4 of 32\noffer high-resolution imagery\
    \ for efﬁcient disease detection and analysis. These collect\ndata with a higher\
    \ resolution even in challenging weather conditions, thus providing\naccurate\
    \ fruit health assessment and decision-making. Spraying fungicides using UAVs\
    \ is\na current means of disease control [20]. Researchers are optimizing different\
    \ parameters\nsuch as speed, altitude, duration of the ﬂight, tank capacities,\
    \ etc., for efﬁcacy. Operating at\nlower heights reduces mass spraying whereas\
    \ operating at higher heights allows disease\nmanagement in mountainous areas\
    \ as well [21]. Their rotors generate downward airﬂow\nthat makes droplets penetration\
    \ easier. These are considered safer for mapping larger or\nuneven areas.\nAll\
    \ the beneﬁts are enhancing the application of UAVs in the agriculture sector.\
    \ The\nUnited States (US), Australia, India, South Africa, Japan, China, Europe,\
    \ Canada, and other\ncountries are using swarm technology on a wider scale [22].\
    \ Additionally, these countries\nare employing controller systems, propulsion\
    \ systems, navigation systems, camera sys-\ntems, frames, batteries, and other\
    \ devices for numerous agricultural purposes [23]. Major\npurposes are ﬁeld mapping,\
    \ disease detection, crop spraying, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, and\
    \ others. In the US, the agriculture drone market is growing rapidly due\nto numerous\
    \ applications of UAVs in agriculture [24]. In Australia, growers in Queens-\n\
    land are using this technology for improving on-farm tasks. Currently, Pakistan\
    \ is also\nemploying UAVs equipped with sensors and other IoT devices for disease\
    \ detection, pest\nmonitoring, temporal and geospatial sampling, mapping, fertilization,\
    \ and others [25]. In\nIndia, the agriculture department of Rajasthan is employing\
    \ UAVs for multiple purposes\nwhile improving parameters and ensuring safety features.\
    \ They have used this technol-\nogy for ﬁghting locust attacks. South Africa is\
    \ adopting smart agriculture not only to\nexpand production but also to contribute\
    \ to the environment by cutting costs and saving\nresources [12]. Researchers\
    \ in China and Japan are employing UAVs, satellites, and AI\ntechniques to formulate\
    \ such strategies that will diagnose the disease before it becomes\nvisible [26].\
    \ They are applying robotics with deep learning to propel the harvesting task.\n\
    Soft grippers are making harvesting tasks possible for UAVs. However, this requires\
    \ further\nimprovement of technology and tools for perfection. Moreover, researchers\
    \ are working on\nmultirobot technologies for agriculture [27]. In the coming\
    \ years, they will use UAVs and\nUGVs (unmanned ground vehicles) for performing\
    \ combined tasks. Table 1, summarize\nthe recent technologies that is used for\

    \ produces lesions or dark blotches on the fruits, leaves,\nand young twigs of\
    \ Rosaceae fruits. The symptoms of Scab are not identical at all stages\nand depend\
    \ upon when the infection took place [28]. At ﬁrst, chlorotic or yellow spots\n\
    appear on leaves, and as the disease progresses olive or dark-colored spots appear\
    \ not only\non leaves but also on fruits. When the disease becomes severe, velvety\
    \ spots appear on\nthe leaves’ undersurface. Leaves turn yellow and start falling.\
    \ Then, these spots formed\non stems force the ﬂower to drop. The fruits affected\
    \ by these spots, which ﬁrst appear\nas olive-green spots, later become black\
    \ or brown lesions. The fruits can become cracked\nand malformed and dropped by\
    \ the plant prematurely [29]. Sometimes Scab appears as\nblack spots on Rosaceae\
    \ fruits. Scabs cause severe surface blemishing that results in high\ncrop losses.\n\
    3.1. Causes of Scab Disease\nFoothill and coastal areas have moist and cool early\
    \ summer and spring weather.\nThese are favorable areas and conditions for pathogen\
    \ development. In addition to these\nfactors, heavy rain is also a major factor\
    \ that causes Scab [30]. Scab is caused by the\npathogen fungus Venturia inaequalis.\
    \ This pathogen found in all the regions where Rosaceae\nfruits are grown. It\
    \ can infect the trees at any time, especially in spring. It affects the leaves\n\
    and then produces and releases spores into the air. These spores are carried by\
    \ rain, wind,\nirrigation, or developing fruit. If the spores are dropped on the\
    \ surface, these spores remain\nstuck to the surface, break through the cuticle,\
    \ germinate, and develop a new secondary\ninfection. This secondary infection\
    \ occurs in speciﬁc periods, within 9–17 days, and may\nrepeat its cycle several\
    \ times during the growing season [31]. This fungal disease is a\nmain issue in\
    \ the production of commercial Rosaceae fruits. It affects the quality of the\n\
    fruits and reduces production. If it is not treated properly, it weakens the trees\
    \ and ﬂower\nbud formations, which leads to an increase in economic loss. This\
    \ disease has no proper\ntreatment; therefore, prevention and early detection\
    \ are important for its control.\n3.2. Ways of Prevention\nThe best way to prevent\
    \ Scab is to select disease-resistant varieties, which have a wide\nrange from\
    \ moderately resistant to very resistant. Another preventive measure is to plant\n\
    trees with sufﬁcient spaces and in open canopies where sunlight is available.\
    \ Planting trees\nwith spaces allows trees to mature properly and sunlight will\
    \ dry the leaves quickly. This\nreduces the chances for spore germination [19].\
    \ The other important measure is pruning.\nRemoving fallen leaves is required\
    \ not only in autumn but also during the entire growing\nseason. Leaves diagnosed\
    \ with Scab must not be thrown in the compost; however, they\nmust be disposed\
    \ of properly. The application of urea after harvest is also beneﬁcial. Proper\n\
    sanitation is also a prime prevention measure. Changing the schedule to water\
    \ trees and\ncovering the soil with compost also prevents the spread of Scab.\
    \ If a tree loses most of its\nleaves, then the application of fungicide is the\
    \ only option. The fungicide does not have any\neffect on the infected trees,\
    \ but it breaks the disease cycle by creating a protective coating\nDrones 2023,\
    \ 7, 97\n6 of 32\nthat keeps the spores inactive. For effective disease management,\
    \ the timing of fungicide\napplication is quite important [3].\n3.3. Early Detection\
    \ Methods\nNumerous ways can be adopted to perceive the pathology of Rosaceae\
    \ fruits. Some-\ntimes the symptoms appear randomly, therefore these are mostly\
    \ ignored. Similarly, over-\ncrowded trees and leaves hinder symptoms and when\
    \ these symptoms become noticeable\nit becomes difﬁcult to take any precautions\
    \ or to treat Scab. These reasons pose challenges\nin Scab identiﬁcation and treatment;\
    \ therefore, early Scab diagnosis is essential through\nprecise and automatic\
    \ disease identiﬁcation [32]. The agriculture industry is adopting\nsensors, advanced\
    \ AI tools, and information perception systems for achieving images and\ninformation\
    \ to make precise decisions for the prevention, identiﬁcation, and classiﬁcation\n\
    of diseases. In [33], three imaging devices: a thermal camera, a multispectral\
    \ camera, and a\n3D sensor, were used for early Scab detection in apples. The\
    \ study reported in [34] applied\na modiﬁed MobileNet CNN model for diagnosing\
    \ Scab and other diseases at the initial\nstages in avocados. In [35], a promising\
    \ PeachNet structure comprising VGG-19, mask\nR-CNN, and a regional proposal network\
    \ (RPN) was used for the early detection of Scab\nin peaches.\n4. Recent Challenges\
    \ in Scab Detection\nAutomatic operations for Scab detection require no direct\
    \ human interactions. The\nmost appropriate solution for this is the use of UAVs\
    \ equipped with imaging sensors\nand advanced AI algorithms [19]. This combined\
    \ technology has beneﬁts in agricultural\noperations; however, owing to challenges,\
    \ their usage is still unpopular and restricted in\nmany countries. Figure 2 highlights\
    \ these challenges that limit UAV application for Scab\ndetection, which are described\
    \ in the following subsections.\n2023, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n6  of  34 \ncreating a protective coating that keeps the spores inactive. For effective disease manage‐\n\

    \ fruits using UAVs.\n4.1. Anomalies of Symptoms and Lab Analysis for Scab Detection\n\
    Diseases are ﬁrst detected by analyzing the symptoms. In some cases, symptoms\
    \ of\nScab disease are quite like other diseases because of ﬁne-grained multiscale\
    \ distribution, the\nsame color texture between background and disease, and the\
    \ growth of multiple diseases on\na leaf [36]. Owing to this symptom relevancy,\
    \ appropriate Scab detection becomes difﬁcult.\nHowever, sometimes Scab shows\
    \ variation in symptoms. This occurs due to several\nreasons such as environmental\
    \ factors, disease developmental stages, presence of other\ndiseases. Environmental\
    \ factors such as humidity, sunlight, temperature, wind, etc., affect\nthe symptoms\
    \ of Scab disease in various parts of trees, whereas Scab also exhibits different\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n7 of 32\nsymptoms at different developmental stages. In [37],\
    \ many images were obtained during\nfour months under different environmental\
    \ conditions and developmental stages on old\nand young leaves of apples. The\
    \ dataset of Scab images showed the variation in symptoms,\nand many other images\
    \ contained several similar-appearing symptoms that required\nfurther expert conﬁrmation.\
    \ Moreover, molecular techniques and laboratory analysis\nfor Scab detection for\
    \ every fruit are not possible in forests or larger ﬁelds. Additionally,\ntransmission\
    \ charges are also incurred to send the images to distant laboratories for analysis.\n\
    Therefore, such methodologies are required that will overcome all of these challenges.\n\
    4.2. Capacity Limitations of UAV Components That Restrict Flying\nWe discussed\
    \ limitations of UAVs in previous papers that include challenges of control,\n\
    path planning, obstacle detection and avoidance, navigation and guidance, and\
    \ others [38].\nIn this paper, various restricted capacity issues are discussed\
    \ that hinder the performance\nof UAVs in larger ﬁelds of Rosaceae fruits. These\
    \ issues are limited capacities of payload,\nbattery, and in-built data storage.\
    \ Most UAVs have limited payload capacity that constrains\nthe battery size and\
    \ sensor. The limited battery demands shorter ﬂying time and requires\na quick\
    \ interchange of batteries for covering larger agricultural areas of apple orchards.\n\
    Only ﬂying at higher altitudes can cover these areas, but this results in lower\
    \ resolution\nimages [39]. UAVs have less in-built storage capacity, so the captured\
    \ data must be sent\nto other platforms. To cope with these challenges, secure\
    \ and cost-effective devices along\nwith strong Internet connections or IoT devices\
    \ are also core requirements [40].\n4.3. Effects of Forest Attributes on UAVs\
    \ and Images\nFarms and forests have different-sized trees, uneven areas, and\
    \ uncertain climatic\nconditions. Owing to variations in the heights and thickness\
    \ of trees, UAVs require proper\nobstacle-avoidance and path planning. While ﬂying\
    \ above different-sized Rosaceae fruit\ntrees, the complex motion of UAVs must\
    \ manage to allow accurate maneuvers. UAVs\nmust be capable of entering or exit\
    \ any tree row and navigate to the other rows easily [41].\nUneven areas have\
    \ varying altitudes owing to which different elevation angles are formed\nbetween\
    \ the farmland and UAVs. Both issues result in path loss and inﬂuence the coverage\n\
    radius and network services, which lead to crashes. Especially ﬁxed-wing UAVs\
    \ in such\nrough places are usually subject to crashes. Climate plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ part in obtaining\nplant images through UAVs. The speed of UAVs is inﬂuenced\
    \ by high winds and rain [42].\nThis causes angular movement leading to overlapping\
    \ and distortions among images.\nMoreover, high wind changes the position of leaves\
    \ and affects visibility. This leads to\ninconsistencies in images and improper\
    \ disease detection [43]. Therefore, the effects in\nimages resulting from all\
    \ these issues need further analysis and interpretation. It is also\nessential\
    \ to gather knowledge regarding the attributes of forests and larger ﬁelds before\n\
    deploying UAVs.\n4.4. Limitations of Sensors and Factors Causing Visibility Issues\
    \ in Images\nThe interaction process between the Scab pathogen and Rosaceae fruits\
    \ can be de-\ntermined by biochemical and physiological parameters but are restricted\
    \ to be reﬂected\nin speciﬁc reﬂectance wavelength. Sensors provide higher spatial,\
    \ spectral, radiometric,\nand temporal resolution images. While obtaining images\
    \ of Rosaceae fruits via UAVs,\nsensors play an important role but have different\
    \ impacts on different dimensions of reso-\nlution [44]. The altitude of the sensor\
    \ above the ground governs the spatial resolution. If\nthe sensor is closer to\
    \ the Rosaceae fruit, then the coverage is smaller, however, the spatial\nresolution\
    \ is greater. Red, green–blue (RGB) sensors capture higher spatial resolution\n\
    images as compared to multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. RGB sensors provide\n\
    ﬁner details about Scab, but they are restricted to measuring only three electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum bands; therefore, they give less accuracy in Scab detection in terms\
    \ of spectral\nresolution. Multispectral sensors can capture high spatial resolution\
    \ and determine re-\nﬂectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands. They assist in\
    \ early Scab detection but are the\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n8 of 32\nleast affordable\
    \ sensors. Similarly, hyperspectral sensors are also expensive but may deliver\n\
    images with low spatial resolution. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors yield\
    \ higher\nspectral resolution than RGB sensors. Hyperspectral sensors collect\
    \ a large amount of\nspectral data, which causes difﬁculties in acquiring relevant\
    \ details about Scab disease.\nThey yield continuous and high spectral ranges\
    \ that help in differentiating Scab from other\ndiseases, even in the presence\
    \ of minor differences and early detection of Scab. Thermal\nsensors provide the\
    \ temperature of the surrounding objects in the images. Therefore, they\nprovide\
    \ low dimensions of resolution in images for Scab detection.\nDifferent ﬁeld-based\
    \ platforms for Scab detection are vehicles, tripods, UAVs, satellites,\nhelicopters,\
    \ etc. These platforms retain high spatial resolution and reﬁne the measure-\n\
    ment throughput to a certain extent. The satellite platform provides free images\
    \ while\ncovering large areas. These images complement UAV imagery but are restricted\
    \ to low\nresolution [20]. Therefore, it is not suitable for Scab detection. Satellites\
    \ give the low-\nest spatial resolution whereas UAV platforms offer high spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution\nalong with high throughput; therefore, they are best\
    \ for Scab detection. However, ﬂight\nparameters and stability inﬂuence the sensors,\
    \ dimensions of the resolution, and spectral\ndiscrimination. For example, changes\
    \ in UAV speed and altitude also restrict the sensor to\ncapture clear images.\
    \ Another factor is the noise of these sensors that inﬂuence the visibility\n\
    of images. All these factors result in overlapping, uneven resolution, and distortion\
    \ in\nimages. Considering different sensors and platforms, none can yield high\
    \ resolution in\nall dimensions. Researchers are still exploring sensors that\
    \ can provide high-resolution\ntemporal, spatial, spectral, and radiometric data,\
    \ which remain uninﬂuenced by all these\nfactors. Moreover, high-resolution spectral\
    \ and spatial images are necessary for accurate\nScab detection in Rosaceae fruits,\
    \ so that features can be distinguished properly [44,45].\nMoreover, UAV platforms\
    \ also affect the sensors and dimensions of resolutions.\n4.5. Requisite of Segmentation\
    \ and Classiﬁcation\nThe UAV-captured data must have proper parameters such as\
    \ disease differentiation,\ndetection, and severity quantiﬁcation. Nevertheless,\
    \ these images possess huge and com-\nplex data. In most cases, mixed pixels of\
    \ soil or shadows are usually inevitable, which\nmakes the background disorganized\
    \ and noisy. Therefore, these images require multiple\noperations such as feature\
    \ extraction, segmentation, and classiﬁcation for accurate Scab\ndetection. The\
    \ segmentation is complicated if the target fruit, for example, green apple,\n\
    matches the color of the background [46]. If the part or features are not extracted\
    \ and\nsegmented properly, the classiﬁcation or Scab detection accuracy will decline,\
    \ which leads\nto incorrect disease identiﬁcation. Segmentation and classiﬁcation\
    \ are performed with\nDL models and algorithms. However, they cannot extract effective\
    \ features with too few\nconvolutional layers. To achieve satisfying outcomes,\
    \ CNN requires more convolutional\nlayers, which will exceed the computational\
    \ time and require a large training dataset and\nIoT system support [47].\n4.6.\
    \ Application Issues of UAVs\nFarmers and researchers have several concerns regarding\
    \ UAVs that give rise to user-\nacceptance issues [48]. Some reasons include handling\
    \ issues, privacy issues, security\nissues, permission issues, huge investments,\
    \ and other miscellaneous factors. Managing\nthe drones properly is not easy for\
    \ farmers; therefore, there is a risk of damage and injuries.\nIn [39], during\
    \ its ﬁrst ﬂight, the UAV became unresponsive due to mechanical failure.\nSimilarly,\
    \ they are concerned about the privacy of the captured data as well as cyber security\n\
    issues. The study reported in [49] emphasized the security analysis of drones.\
    \ It suggested\nthat security requirements vary according to the use case. Lightweight\
    \ hardware also was\nproposed in that it ensures the integrity and conﬁdentiality\
    \ of the data sent by the drone\nand the ground station. This hardware solution\
    \ proved to be a power-efﬁcient computation\nplatform; however, owing to extra\
    \ weight, its application was restricted. Additionally,\nthe high sensor dependency\
    \ and malware of drones along with the dynamic nature and\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n\
    9 of 32\ncomplexity of wireless communication networks were considered security\
    \ vulnerabilities\nfor the application of drones. In this study, global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) spooﬁng, data\ninterception, denial of service, malware infection,\
    \ the man-in-the-middle, wormholes, and\njammers were all detailed as possible\
    \ threats and attacks that jeopardize the security and\nreliability of drone communication.\n\
    Operating UAVs on farms requires special permission from regulating authorities.\n\
    Many authorities do not allow UAV integration due to several reasons [50]. For\
    \ example,\npermission was granted only after several days by Transport Canada\
    \ to deploy UAVs in\napple orchards [39]. Moreover, huge investments are essential\
    \ for advanced components\nand sensors for UAVs. Small-scale farmers are unable\
    \ to make such arrangements. Other\nmiscellaneous factors that negatively inﬂuence\
    \ its adoption include the location of farms,\ncompatibility of existing practices\
    \ with new and complex techniques, and others [51]. All\nthese challenges are\
    \ barriers to the application of UAVs for Scab identiﬁcation and other\nagricultural\
    \ purposes. More advanced and feasible solutions are essential to overcome\nthese\
    \ issues.\n5. Recent Methodologies to Overcome Challenges\nThis section describes\
    \ various trending methodologies that efﬁciently manage the\nhurdles of the abovementioned\
    \ challenges. All these evolving technologies are signiﬁcant\nfor accurate Scab\
    \ identiﬁcation even in the presence of symptom anomalies and for ex-\ntending\
    \ the capacities of UAV components along with ﬂight duration [52]. Additionally,\n\
    these approaches provide solutions to overcome the effects of forest attributes\
    \ on UAVs and\nimages, limitations of the sensors, and reduce the visibility issues\
    \ in images [53]. Moreover,\nsome developed algorithms and methods for better\
    \ segmentation and classiﬁcation of\ndatasets are evaluated in this section. Different\
    \ solutions that resolve the application issues\nof UAVs for agricultural purposes\
    \ are also detailed in this section.\n5.1. Advanced Approaches That Assist in\
    \ Scab Detection in the Presence of Symptom Anomalies\nand Laboratory Analysis\n\
    Diseases are ﬁrst identiﬁed based on symptoms which sometimes show relevancy or\n\
    sometimes show variances [44]. Therefore, detecting Scab disease in such cases\
    \ requires\nhigh-resolution images of fruits or leaves. In this context, the use\
    \ of UAVs with advanced\nsensors is a good option. These sensors not only capture\
    \ images with high spatial resolution,\nbut also give pure pixels of trees, parts\
    \ of trees, tissues, and pathogens. These mountable\nsensors, especially hyperspectral\
    \ ones, along with platform ﬂexibility have enabled UAVs\nto span leaf, plant,\
    \ and observation scales that beneﬁt the Scab detection process [54].\nConnected\
    \ and sensor-equipped smartphones are also advantageous in disease detection,\n\
    especially in the presence of symptom anomalies [55]. Different software in smartphones\n\
    performs the preprocessing of images. These smartphones can be deployed on UAVs\
    \ to\nassist not only in detecting anomalies but also to identify the location\
    \ of anomalies and\nreduce the transmission costs of sending the images to distant\
    \ laboratories for analysis. Fur-\nthermore, the recent DL techniques are capable\
    \ of identifying and differentiating a disease\ncorrectly with relevant or variable\
    \ symptoms. This advancement allows early detection of\nScab as well. Different\
    \ researchers applied hyperspectral or multispectral imaging with the\nDL techniques\
    \ to distinguish accurately the Scab diseases with anomalies of symptoms [56].\n\
    This combined approach analyzes and classiﬁes UAV-acquired images of fruits or\
    \ leaves\nwith higher accuracy. Moreover, this technique applies to both laboratory\
    \ analysis and\nUAV-based conditions. The severity of Scab disease can be measured\
    \ by determining the\ntotal diseased area of fruit or by calculating the amount\
    \ of disease penetration through\nquantiﬁcation methods.\n5.2. Evolving Techniques\
    \ That Extend the Capacity of UAV Components and Flight Duration\nWith progress\
    \ in technology, researchers are employing several methodologies to cope\nwith\
    \ payload or capacity issues of inbuilt components of UAVs [57]. The best solutions\
    \ are\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n10 of 32\nthe application of miniature sensors, ﬂying\
    \ at higher altitudes, usage of solar technology,\nsoftware-deﬁned storage, etc.\
    \ Sensor miniaturization solves the payload constraints. Flying\nat higher altitudes\
    \ or ﬂying in formation will not only limit the battery resource but also\nsaves\
    \ time. Replacing the usage of larger UAVs with solar energy-equipped UAVs enhances\n\
    the durability, power, and ﬂight time of UAVs to cover larger areas [55]. Moreover,\
    \ solar\npanels are lighter in weight, so they maintain the agility of UAVs by\
    \ ensuring that UAV is\nlightweight. Software-deﬁned storage such as cloud-based\
    \ data storage is a cost-effective\nsolution for in-built restricted capacity\
    \ with strong Internet signals [58]. Another option is\nvirtual storage, which\
    \ is also a low-cost solution for real-time applications. For example,\nBramor\
    \ UAVs utilize a high-speed Internet protocol (IP) link for transmitting and storing\n\
    data to its computing infrastructure, cloud computing, or ground control station\
    \ (GCS) [59].\nTo overcome the routing and strong Internet connections, researchers\
    \ are using wireless\nnetworking technologies such as the Fifth Generation (5G)\
    \ and smart Bluetooth [60]. All\nthese solutions excel in the performance and\
    \ ﬂying of UAVs.\n5.3. Recent Technologies That Handle Effects of Forest Attributes\n\
    Forests have different-sized trees, uneven terrain, and different climatic conditions\
    \ [61].\nAll these attributes affect the performance of UAVs and sensors. The\
    \ advances in UAVs and\nIoT devices have led to the development of an unmanned\
    \ aerial system (UAS) that is widely\napplied by numerous researchers. UASs provides\
    \ complete details regarding the features of\nindividual trees and analyzes the\
    \ surface topology and unevenness in forests [62]. Another\nsolution is the developed\
    \ architectures of UAVs with different regression models and\nartiﬁcial neural\
    \ network (ANN)-based models that forecast and update weather conditions.\nThis\
    \ real-time information enables UAVs to stay unaffected by all these factors.\
    \ Furthermore,\nit helps in operating UAVs safely without any damage or crashes.\
    \ With the evolving\ntechnology, various kinds of UAV platforms are progressing\
    \ that are signiﬁcant for larger\nﬁelds and forest deployments. For example, miniature\
    \ UAVs, which also called low-\naltitude platforms, are privileged to deploy in\
    \ forests because of their high mobility with\nless cost [63]. They can stay in\
    \ the air for a longer time, remaining unaffected by harsh\nclimatic conditions\
    \ and site conditions during takeoff. They easily retain the high spatial\nresolution\
    \ and reﬁne the measurement throughput. Another widely applied UAV platform\n\
    is a multirotor UAV that can ﬂy at different altitudes. It can ﬂy vertically as\
    \ well as\nhorizontally and needs a smaller space for landing and takeoff. An\
    \ optical sensor equipped\nwith it can easily capture clear three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) resolution images. The vertical\ntakeoff and landing (VTOL) system in UAVs\
    \ is a recent development that allows ease in\nmaneuvering [64]. VTOL UAVs also\
    \ remain unaffected by the attributes of forests and\nclimatic conditions. Moreover,\
    \ if image distortion is caused by platform tilt, position or\nvibration of UAVs,\
    \ uneven terrains or earth curvature, or other reasons, then geometric\ncorrection\
    \ can be applied to remove it.\n5.4. Advanced Sensors and Approaches That Reﬂect\
    \ Visibility in Images\nThe integration of sensors on a UAV depends upon their\
    \ application, size, and weight.\nThe widely applied advanced spectral sensors\
    \ are RGB, thermal, multispectral, hyperspec-\ntral, and light detection and ranging\
    \ (LiDAR) sensors [65]. Multispectral and RGB are\ncost-effective and provide\
    \ higher resolutions. Besides these optical sensors, researchers\nare using other\
    \ camera options as well that also show advantages. For example, the study\nreported\
    \ in [66] designed a cost-effective and ultralight UAV oblique photogrammetry\n\
    (OP) system using smartphones. Five digital cameras were removed from smartphones\n\
    and mounted on a UAV platform. This UAV OP system obtained images from different\n\
    angles and the results proved the accuracy and quality of the developed system.\
    \ Similarly,\nresearchers are focusing on using Meta optics for inexpensive and\
    \ small electro-optical\nsensors in miniature UAVs. Sometimes the UAV-obtained\
    \ images are not visible. As a\nsolution to this issue, ﬁxed-wing UAVs equipped\
    \ with fast shutter and speedy imaging\nsensors can be used [67]. This limits\
    \ the blurring issues while capturing images. Fur-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n11 of\
    \ 32\nthermore, advanced AI preprocessing methods can remove blur effects, visibility,\
    \ noise,\nand distortion issues in UAV-obtained images. These methods depend upon\
    \ the type and\nquality of an image. Some data preprocessing methods are spectral\
    \ calibration, atmospheric\ncalibration, and geometric correction [68]. These\
    \ approaches are signiﬁcant in removing\nerrors. Spectral calibration employs\
    \ complex techniques such as spectral interpolation,\nspectral normalization,\
    \ and radiation transfer models. Atmospheric calibration helps to\nreduce surface\
    \ reﬂectivity errors that are due to atmospheric absorption and scattering.\n\
    Geometric correction removes distortion in images, as discussed above. Moreover,\
    \ image\nenhancement, spectral smoothing, and data ﬁltering techniques can be\
    \ applied to remove\ndisorganized and noisy data by highlighting the targeted\
    \ characteristics [69]. Spectral\nsmoothing techniques include Savitzky–Golay\
    \ smoothing, minimum noise-fraction rota-\ntion, moving average smoothing, and\
    \ others. Data ﬁltering techniques include Gaussian\nﬁltering, linear ﬁltering,\
    \ etc. Image enhancement techniques include homomorphic ﬁltering,\nhistogram equalization,\
    \ and others.\n5.5. Recent Methodologies That Allow Effective Segmentation and\
    \ Accurate Classiﬁcation\nSegmentation and feature extraction processes are essential\
    \ for UAV-generated im-\nages [19]. These processes organize the data following\
    \ discriminative information. The\ncommonly applied techniques for segmentation\
    \ are thresholding, region-based, edge-based,\nclustering-based, and neural network\
    \ (NN)-based methods [70]. Gray-level co-occurrence\nmatrix (GLCM), principal\
    \ component analysis (PCA), discrete wavelet transforms (DWT),\nand NN-based models\
    \ used extensively for feature extraction [71]. All these approaches\nenable classiﬁcation\
    \ with accuracy. Technological advancements have developed many\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ algorithms and models that categorize diseases efﬁciently, accurately, and\n\
    rapidly. ML classiﬁers are widely applied for the classiﬁcation of diseases and\
    \ early detec-\ntion [72]. These classiﬁers are rooted in image segmentation and\
    \ feature extraction. The\nCNN models are the current approaches for solving the\
    \ data complexity and removing\nnoisy and disorganized backgrounds in images.\
    \ The deep convolutional neural network\n(DCNN) model achieves higher than 90%\
    \ accuracy and the multilayer convolutional neu-\nral network (MCNN) achieves\
    \ more than 95% accuracy in many kinds of research while\nclassifying healthy\
    \ and diseased leaves appropriately [73]. Moreover, these can identify\nmultiple\
    \ diseases. Current studies have employed semi supervised classiﬁcation methods\n\
    for creating more diverse images [74]. This reduces the discrepancy in dataset\
    \ accuracy.\nAn extensive description of recent techniques of segmentation, feature\
    \ extraction, and\nclassiﬁcation processes is provided in the next sections.\n\
    5.6. Solutions That Address the Application Issues of UAVs\nThe reasons that hinder\
    \ the application of UAVs are user-acceptance issues, handling\nissues, safety\
    \ issues, privacy issues, security issues, permission issues, the need for huge\n\
    investments, and other miscellaneous factors [4]. There are numerous solutions\
    \ to address\nthese application issues. As an example, developments of Android\
    \ applications provide\nease in operating UAVs and ensure safety for farmers [75].\
    \ These applications connect with\nthe farmers via a Bluetooth module, which is\
    \ embedded in the UAVs. Gyro, accelerome-\nter, and magnetometer help in managing\
    \ the balance, aerial stability, and orientation of\nUAVs [76]. Intel has developed\
    \ efﬁcient and low-cost Bluetooth-interfaced UAV structures\nthat avoid collisions\
    \ and ensure safety from equipment damage [77]. This framework\nprovides wireless\
    \ communications among all the UAVs and shares data about their current\nlocation,\
    \ direction, altitude, and speed. The Bluetooth technology adaptation is highly\n\
    beneﬁcial, gives higher efﬁciency, and is cost-effective. Similarly, smartphones\
    \ equipped\nwith cameras and GPS sensors are promising tools for farmers [78].\
    \ Smartphones, being\naffordable and easy to use, are a better option to overcome\
    \ the handling and security issues\nfor farmers. Another solution is the merger\
    \ of formal techniques with ML techniques\nthat develops dependable learning-enabled\
    \ systems. This merger provides excellent per-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n12 of 32\n\
    formance with the assurance of safety and security of systems through a speciﬁcation\n\
    language [79]. Moreover, formal methods verify the application of AI techniques\
    \ [80].\nAI manages all the data security issues, especially those that are evoked\
    \ in trans-\nferring data. ANN-based approaches, blockchain, mobile edge computing\
    \ (MEC), and\nphysically unclonable function (PUF) schemes are the security countermeasures\
    \ against\ncyberattacks [81]. These schemes protect the integrity and conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data. Another\nstudy [82] analyzed threats and attacks as the risks of cybersecurity\
    \ and proposes ML\ntechniques, blockchain, software-deﬁned networks (SDN), and\
    \ fog computing as coun-\ntermeasures. Additionally, a combination of the CNN\
    \ model and the Internet of drones\n(IoD) is advantageous [83]. This study uses\
    \ wireless communication technology that de-\nvelops a more optimized system security\
    \ for the model and suggests that the clustering\nalgorithm developed on node\
    \ energy gives the best performance. Another study [84] solves\nthe security and\
    \ communication issues by designing an authentication protocol over the\nFifth\
    \ Generation (5G) technology. This enhanced protocol provides better security\
    \ and\nresists privileged insider attacks, impersonation attacks, drone capture\
    \ attacks, mutual\nauthentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, tempo-\nrary information disclosure attacks, and untrace ability. Furthermore,\
    \ nations are slowly\nmaking transitions from “banning” to “guiding” policies.\
    \ The management measures\nalso show development from various aspects. The recent\
    \ efforts of regulatory authorities\nand local governments serve a pioneering\
    \ role in composing management regulations for\nUAVs [85]. Smartphone applications\
    \ allow paperless work, and communication between\nfarmers, ofﬁcials, and researchers,\
    \ and provide the solution to farming issues [86]. This\nstudy presents an analysis\
    \ of the apps developed by Indian governmental institutes. Trend-\ning methodologies\
    \ are developing budget-friendly UAVs and related equipment. UAV\nimagery provides\
    \ automatic and rapid analysis of forests and farms that reduces project\ncosts.\
    \ Instead of employing labor, expensive surveying tools, and heavy machinery,\
    \ this\ntechnology produces data with higher accuracy and less expense. Moreover,\
    \ UAVs can\nfrequently survey farms for monitoring purposes that provide the current\
    \ growth and con-\ndition of trees and reduces the chances of Scab and other diseases.\
    \ This also prevents food\nand economic losses. UAVs are environmentally friendly.\
    \ Most of the UAVs have electric\nmotors so they use no fossil fuels while some\
    \ use fewer fossil fuels; in both cases, they\nproduce no or negligible greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions. Furthermore, UAV imagery improves\nthe environmental conditions\
    \ that hugely contribute to the sustainable development of\nagriculture. All these\
    \ solutions will lead to user-acceptance and extensive application of\nUAVs. Table\

    \ Extraction Techniques in Image Analysis of Rosaceae Fruits\nIn Scab disease\
    \ detection using UAVs, feature extraction is considered one of the\nprime pillars\
    \ [87]. Essential information and features are predetermined in this phase.\n\
    These isolated features are combined and optimized to form new feature vectors\
    \ and then\nforwarded for the classiﬁcation process. The extraction techniques\
    \ improve the accuracy of\nthe classiﬁcation and allow efﬁcient Scab detection.\
    \ Moreover, feature extraction secures the\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n14 of 32\nspectral\
    \ information and operates dimension reduction in hyperspectral data images [88].\n\
    The processing features are extracted according to the study. A study in [89]\
    \ used the\nsped-up robust feature (SURF) technique to extract desired regions\
    \ of interest from a\nsegmented image of an apple. Three widely focused visual\
    \ contents: shape, color, and\ntexture, were extracted by various techniques [87].\
    \ Binary image algorithms and horizontal\nand vertical segmentation were applied\
    \ for shape extraction. The histogram intersection\n(HI) method, Zernike chromaticity\
    \ distribution moments, and color histogram are color\nextraction methods. Similarly,\
    \ the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), edge detection,\nand texture–law\
    \ measures are some texture extraction approaches [90].\nCertain techniques are\
    \ used to extract a single feature while some techniques are\ncapable in extracting\
    \ multiple features [45]. The GLCM approach extracts grayscale global\nfeatures.\
    \ Similarly, for color edge detection, binary quaternion-moment-preserving (BQMP)\n\
    can be applied. BQMP uses a histogram to show regions of an image with certain\
    \ colors.\nFor size, distance, and location extraction, a spatial gray-level dependence\
    \ matrix can\nbe employed. Histogram of gradients (HOG) is a fast feature extraction\
    \ method. ML\ntechniques play a signiﬁcant role in extracting multiple and deep\
    \ features [44]. To obtain a\ndeep learning network, CNN architectures are optimal\
    \ solutions. These models comprise\ntwo signiﬁcant functions, namely convolution\
    \ and pooling, which detect pattern edges\nand reduce the image sizes. Classic\
    \ CNN, InceptionV3, AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG are\nthe commonly applied architectures\
    \ for visual feature extraction [91]. Table 3 provides an\nanalysis of different\
    \ studies that employed these techniques for Scab detection in Rosaceae\nfamily\

    After image acquisition, proper analysis of imagery data is essential and uses\
    \ image\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation techniques [45]. Image segmentation is\
    \ the process of split-\nting a digital image into components that give meaningful\
    \ data. It is a process of assigning\nan object class to every single pixel of\
    \ an image. It provides complete details of all the object\nclasses in an image.\
    \ Different approaches for segmentation are thresholding, edge-based,\nregion-based,\
    \ watershed, clustering-based, and neural networks-based methods [101].\n7.1.1.\
    \ Thresholding Segmentation\nThe segmentation technique that works on the histogram\
    \ features of an image and\nhelps to segment images containing bright objects\
    \ or patches is known as thresholding [102].\nThis technique transforms a colored\
    \ or grayscale image into a binary (black and white)\nimage that helps in further\
    \ processes and minimizes difﬁculties. The thresholding process\ncan be global,\
    \ local, and dynamic based on gray levels and neighborhood attributes [46]. In\n\
    disease detection, it proves to be the simplest and ideal for real-time segmentation\
    \ but can\nbe inﬂuenced by noise.\n7.1.2. Edge-Based Segmentation\nEdge-based\
    \ segmentation techniques are based on marking discontinuities of numer-\nous\
    \ factors such as colors, gray levels, and others [103]. These techniques blend\
    \ detected\nedges into edge chains for constructing borders or object boundaries.\
    \ Some operators for\nedge detection are Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Laplacian,\
    \ Marr–Hilclrath, and Canny [104].\nIn Scab detection, these approaches perform\
    \ segmentation on images that possess better\ncontrast among objects. However,\
    \ in some cases, these methods give false edges that reduce\nthe detection accuracy.\n\
    7.1.3. Region-Based Segmentation\nRegion-based segmentation techniques group together\
    \ pixels that possess identical\nfeatures for producing homogeneous regions in\
    \ an image [105]. Gray levels of pixels are\nthe widely used criteria for homogeneities.\
    \ These segmentations are further classiﬁed into\nregion mergers, region splits,\
    \ and splits and mergers [106]. The main advantage of these\nmethods is they can\
    \ easily deﬁne similarity criteria and remain unaffected due to noise.\n7.1.4.\
    \ Watershed Segmentation\nAnother widely applied region-based method for segmentation\
    \ is watershed segmen-\ntation [107]. The watersheds are the lines that decompose\
    \ an image by dividing water areas\ninto catchment basins. Moreover, watersheds\
    \ keep these basins apart and assign every\nsingle pixel to a watershed or a region\
    \ [108]. It gives faster and more accurate segmentation\nwith complete image division\
    \ but sometimes results in excessive segmentation and is\nsensitive to noise.\n\
    7.1.5. Clustering-Based Segmentation\nClustering-based segmentation uses unsupervised\
    \ cluster algorithms. Fuzzy C-means\nand K-means approaches are commonly applied.\
    \ Fuzzy C-means provide soft and K-means\nhard segmentation results. The main\
    \ goal of clustering is to use unlabeled training data\nfor creating decision\
    \ boundaries [89]. The prime advantages of clustering-based methods\nare their\
    \ easy application and disease detection, but they need to deﬁne the k-value of\
    \ the\ncluster and do not give the optimum answer in a few Scab detection studies.\n\
    7.1.6. Neural Networks for Segmentation\nNeural network (NN) is a supervised segmentation\
    \ method [109]. ANN algorithms\nare widely applied for segmentation purposes both\
    \ in unsupervised and supervised modes.\nANN-based models contain an enormous\
    \ number of processing elements that are intercon-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n16 of\
    \ 32\nnected and work together for solving speciﬁc issues. These models can learn\
    \ adaptively,\npossess self-organizing capabilities, and solve complex problems.\
    \ However, these models\nneed to train before segmentation application and require\
    \ more time for it.\n7.1.7. Analysis of Various Segmentation Approaches for Scab\
    \ Detection\nTable 4 represents an evaluation of image segmentation techniques\
    \ for detecting\nScab disease in Rosaceae fruits by various researchers. We collected\
    \ the segmentation\nmethods that have been used from 2019 to 2022. This literature\
    \ review comprises some\ntraditional segmentation methods and the widely used\
    \ NN-based methods in recent times.\nThe traditional methods effectively extract\
    \ the appropriate data and objects from the\nbackground, whereas NN-based models\
    \ perform binary and multiclass segmentation tasks\nsuccessfully, identify minor\
    \ spots effectively, predict disease with higher accuracy and\nprovide robust\

    The process to identify and mark vectors or pixel groups in an image following\
    \ distinct\ncriteria is called classiﬁcation [123]. Classiﬁcation law depends\
    \ upon the usage of single\nor multiple spectral bands features, for example,\
    \ color, shape, texture, etc. Figure 3 shows\nan evaluation for the segmentation\
    \ of interested regions and classiﬁcation of diseases in\npeaches using mask R-CNN\
    \ [35]. The categorization of classiﬁers is based on various rules\nsuch as parametric\
    \ and nonparametric, object-based, and pixel-based. Supervised and\nunsupervised\
    \ methods are the two broad assortments of these classiﬁers [124].\nDrones 2023,\
    \ 7, 97\n17 of 32\nDrones 2023, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n18  of  34 \n \n \nFigure 3. Mask R‐CNN for classification. \n\
    7.2.1. Unsupervised Classification Method: \nUnsupervised classification is a fully automated approach that does not require train‐\n\
    ing samples by its user [123]. The user selects the algorithm for the software and desig‐\n\
    nates the number of output classes for image classification. The software groups the pixels \n\
    based on the feature similarity into classes in a systematic way. It employs pattern recog‐\n\
    nition or clustering. The commonly applied unsupervised classifiers are K‐means cluster‐\n\
    ing, iterative self‐organizing data analysis techniques (ISODATA), hierarchical clustering, \n\
    self‐organizing map (SOM), etc. \ni. \nK‐Means Clustering: K‐means clustering is one of the simple and widely applied clus‐\n\
    tering algorithms for classification [124]. In K‐means clustering, a dataset is split into \n\
    several clusters. Among all the clusters, a minimum of one component must possess \n\
    the image of the principal space of the diseased component [125]. The major drawback \n\
    is the users are restricted to defining the number of clusters for image classification of \n\
    diseased fruits. \nii. \nIterative Self‐Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA): ISODATA is another \n\
    category of unsupervised classifiers [126]. Two parameters strongly influence the clas‐\n\
    sification results. These parameters are the distance threshold that is required for clus‐\n\
    ter union and the typical deviation threshold that is required for cluster deviation. \n\
    ISODATA allows good classification in Scab detection and visual interpretation of \n\
    feature differences in images but shows rare missing point errors. \niii. \nHierarchical Clustering: Another simple unsupervised classifier like K‐means is hier‐\n\
    archical clustering. The only difference is that the number of clusters is not fixed and \n\
    changes in all the iterations. This is further categorized into agglomerative clustering \n\
    and divisive clustering [127]. The prime reasons for using this clustering in disease \n\
    detection are its easy implementation and no requirement for advanced specification \n\
    of the number of clusters. However, it experiences slow classification and does not \n\
    classify well in images having outliers and noise. \n7.2.2. Supervised Classification Method \n\
    Supervised classification allows the user to choose a set of sample pixels, represent‐\n\
    ing classes, in an image and instructs the software to utilize them as references for other \n\
    pixel classifications within that image [128]. The user designates which similar spectral \n\
    features are essential for grouping input data and assigns the number of classes for image \n\
    classification. The widely used supervised classifiers are k‐nearest neighbor (KNN), sup‐\n\
    port vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest (RF), and deep \n\
    learning (DL) models [129]. All these classifiers achieve high accuracy. Some are discussed \n\
    below: \nFigure 3. Mask R-CNN for classiﬁcation.\n7.2.1. Unsupervised Classiﬁcation\
    \ Method:\nUnsupervised classiﬁcation is a fully automated approach that does\
    \ not require train-\ning samples by its user [125]. The user selects the algorithm\
    \ for the software and designates\nthe number of output classes for image classiﬁcation.\
    \ The software groups the pixels based\non the feature similarity into classes\
    \ in a systematic way. It employs pattern recognition or\nclustering. The commonly\
    \ applied unsupervised classiﬁers are K-means clustering, iterative\nself-organizing\
    \ data analysis techniques (ISODATA), hierarchical clustering, self-organizing\n\
    map (SOM), etc.\ni.\nK-Means Clustering: K-means clustering is one of the simple\
    \ and widely applied\nclustering algorithms for classiﬁcation [126]. In K-means\
    \ clustering, a dataset is\nsplit into several clusters. Among all the clusters,\
    \ a minimum of one component\nmust possess the image of the principal space of\
    \ the diseased component [127]. The\nmajor drawback is the users are restricted\
    \ to deﬁning the number of clusters for\nimage classiﬁcation of diseased fruits.\n\
    ii.\nIterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA): ISODATA is\
    \ an-\nother category of unsupervised classiﬁers [128]. Two parameters strongly\
    \ inﬂuence\nthe classiﬁcation results. These parameters are the distance threshold\
    \ that is re-\nquired for cluster union and the typical deviation threshold that\
    \ is required for\ncluster deviation. ISODATA allows good classiﬁcation in Scab\
    \ detection and visual\ninterpretation of feature differences in images but shows\
    \ rare missing point errors.\niii.\nHierarchical Clustering: Another simple unsupervised\
    \ classiﬁer like K-means is\nhierarchical clustering. The only difference is that\
    \ the number of clusters is not ﬁxed\nand changes in all the iterations. This\
    \ is further categorized into agglomerative\nclustering and divisive clustering\
    \ [129]. The prime reasons for using this clustering\nin disease detection are\
    \ its easy implementation and no requirement for advanced\nspeciﬁcation of the\
    \ number of clusters. However, it experiences slow classiﬁcation\nand does not\
    \ classify well in images having outliers and noise.\n7.2.2. Supervised Classiﬁcation\
    \ Method\nSupervised classiﬁcation allows the user to choose a set of sample pixels,\
    \ representing\nclasses, in an image and instructs the software to utilize them\
    \ as references for other pixel\nclassiﬁcations within that image [130]. The user\
    \ designates which similar spectral features\nare essential for grouping input\
    \ data and assigns the number of classes for image classiﬁca-\ntion. The widely\
    \ used supervised classiﬁers are k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector\nmachine\
    \ (SVM), logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest (RF), and deep learning\n\
    (DL) models [131]. All these classiﬁers achieve high accuracy. Some are discussed\
    \ below:\ni.\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): The simplest among all supervised classiﬁcation\
    \ meth-\nods is the k-nearest neighbor rule [132]. It requires selecting k, the\
    \ number of\nneighbors essential for classiﬁcation. The KNN classiﬁer is not commonly\
    \ used\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n18 of 32\nalone because it requires associated visualization;\
    \ however, it may be applied as a\nbaseline classiﬁer for comparison with other\
    \ classiﬁers [133]. The main advantage\nis it is simple and easily applicable\
    \ for small datasets and uses less time for training\nbut shows higher computational\
    \ complexity.\nii.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): SVM selects extreme points for\
    \ producing a hyper-\nplane [134]. A hyperplane is the best decision boundary\
    \ that causes n-dimensional\nspace segregation into appropriate classes. Earlier\
    \ SVM was applicable for binary\nclassiﬁcation only, but now it is modiﬁed to\
    \ perform multiclass classiﬁcation [135].\nThe other key advantages of SVM are\
    \ that it is robust, provides simple geometric\ninterpretations, and shows low\
    \ computational cost. Some drawbacks are the need\nfor large support vectors and\
    \ slow training.\niii.\nLogistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression\
    \ is a powerful supervised\nclassiﬁer instead of a regression model [136]. It\
    \ applied for predictive analysis. It\nis developed on probability notion and\
    \ sigmoid function. This classiﬁer is appli-\ncable for linear and binary classiﬁcation\
    \ [36]. It is a simple, easy-to-realize, and\na more efﬁcient classiﬁcation method\
    \ for disease detection in plants. Neverthe-\nless, it is restricted to giving\
    \ only linear solutions and requires the compilation of\ndata assumptions.\niv.\n\
    Naïve Bayes: A probabilistic classiﬁer formed on the Bayes theorem is called naïve\n\
    Bayes [137]. It assumes that all the features being independent have no interactions\n\
    among them. Being simple in application and fast in computation, it gives better\n\
    performance for large datasets [138]. Therefore, it can be used for real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions also. However, in some cases classiﬁcation accuracy is reduced\
    \ due to class\nconditional independence.\nv.\nRandom Forest (RF): Another supervised\
    \ classiﬁer is random forest, which classiﬁes\nlarge data accurately [139]. It\
    \ uses an ensemble apprenticeship approach for training\nand sums up the prediction\
    \ results of individual trees. Unlike other decision tree\nalgorithms, RF does\
    \ not utilize proﬁt knowledge [140]. It acts as a tree predictor and\nso helps\
    \ in assorting trees randomly in forests. In image classiﬁcation of diseased\n\
    plants, RF handles large databases efﬁciently and estimates signiﬁcant variables.\n\
    However, it results in excessive ﬁtting in some cases due to noise.\nvi.\nDeep\
    \ Learning (DL): The subset of machine learning (ML), in which a computer\nmodel\
    \ imitates human biological learning, is called deep learning (DL) [141]. It\n\
    contains multiple processing layers such as ANNs rather than classical neural\n\
    networks. It includes all the steps, data acquisition, classiﬁcation, and results\n\
    evaluation. The most applied neural network (NN) is an artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN) [142]. It is an image-learning and classiﬁcation tool. NN models perform\n\
    activities identical to human brains. While knowing previous data, these models\
    \ are\ntrained to work on related data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\
    \ recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs)\
    \ are some\ncommonly applied ANN models [143]. These models need fewer formal\
    \ statistics,\nefﬁciently manage noisy data, and give higher accuracy in Scab\
    \ detection, but tend\ntoward excessive ﬁtting due to many layers and huge computations.\n\
    7.3. Analysis of Various Classiﬁcation Approaches\nThis section provides a comprehensive\
    \ analysis of various classiﬁcation algorithms\nand models used by numerous researchers\
    \ for Scab detection in Rosaceae fruits. The\nmodels are developed with deep,\
    \ complex, and high parameters to achieve high accuracy\nwith a limitation of\
    \ complex computation. VGGNet, InceptionV3, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\nand XceptionNet\
    \ are widely used DL models [144]. Some models are developed to achieve\ncomputation\
    \ efﬁciency with a restriction of adequate accuracy. These models work ef-\nﬁciently\
    \ on mobiles like ResNet. [145] applied several ML and DL methods for disease\n\
    detection and the result showed that VGG16 achieved the highest classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy.\nThis evaluated that the number of layers in the NN model indicates\
    \ the network complexity\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n19 of 32\nand too many layers may\
    \ affect the results. Table 5 provides a detailed analysis of the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ used by scholars for image analysis.\nTable 5. Classiﬁcation techniques for\

    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n21 of 32\n8. Utilization of UAV in Scab Detection\nUAVs are\
    \ categorized into ﬁxed-wing UAVs, rotary-wing UAVs, and vertical takeoff\nand\
    \ landing (VTOL) according to their ﬂight platforms [159]. The payload is designed\n\
    according to the task requirement and better functions are achieved with the sacriﬁce\
    \ of\ncertain performances. UAVs have many beneﬁts with a few limitations. Owing\
    \ to this\nreason, UAVs of different platforms and payloads are employed for different\
    \ purposes.\nSome imaging sensors that are essential for UAVs in plant monitoring\
    \ and Scab detection\nare explained below.\nImaging Sensors Required for UAV Monitoring\n\
    Whenever we focus on applications of UAVs in any ﬁeld, one of the foremost factors\n\
    that we consider is the kind and quality of the sensor for aerial imaging. The\
    \ nature\nof research, the type of sensor, and the required image quality decide\
    \ the selection of a\nUAV platform. These imaging sensors work on the conversion\
    \ principle of light rays into\nelectrical signals. The widely applied sensors\
    \ for acquiring images in agriculture are RGB,\nnear-infrared (NIR), multispectral,\
    \ hyperspectral, thermal, and depth sensors. The optical\nfeatures of sensors\
    \ along with electromagnetic ranges are important factors for detecting\nplant\
    \ diseases [141].\ni.\nRGB (Red–Green–Blue) Sensors: RGB spectral sensors are\
    \ the visible light sources\nthat are commonly used. These sensors measure only\
    \ the intensities of three colors\nand evaluate each in every pixel. The naked\
    \ eye is sensitive to three color bands:\nred, blue, and green; therefore, the\
    \ RGB sensor gives images that can be easily\nrecognized by humans. These sensors\
    \ are utilized with other sensors to improve\ntheir accuracy. If a red ﬁlter replaces\
    \ a NIR ﬁlter, then it is named modiﬁed RGB.\nThese sensors are the least expensive\
    \ and are easily available but give low spectral\nresolution images. These capture\
    \ images with high spatial resolution and allow\nﬁner spatial details. These can\
    \ formulate 3D models of plants and can be used\nfor plant inspection in harsh\
    \ weather. Moreover, RGB images give details on LAB\nwhere L stands for lightness\
    \ and AB are dimensions of the color opponent, YCBCR\nwhere Y stands for the luma\
    \ component, CB and CR are the blue difference and\nred difference, Hue, Saturation,\
    \ and Value (HSV), and others [160]. These help\nin identifying diseases in plant\
    \ leaves and fruits. However, their spectral range\nvaries from 380 to 750 nm\
    \ only, and this range cannot be used to identify diseases\nappropriately.\nii.\n\
    Multispectral Sensors: Multispectral sensors are capable in capturing images having\n\
    exceptional spatial resolution and determine reﬂectance in the infrared (IR) bands.\n\
    These sensors use various spectral bands such as red, blue, green, NIR, and red-edge.\n\
    Multiple bands in these sensors give high accuracy. These are classiﬁed into two\n\
    groups according to bandwidth: broadband sensors and narrowband sensors. These\n\
    allow appropriate analytics for agriculture; therefore, these are highly crucial\
    \ for\nresearchers and farmers. Multispectral together with NIR sensors form vegetable\n\
    indices (VI) that rely either on NIR or other light bands [161]. For automatic\
    \ disease\ndetection, multispectral sensors capture images in both regions, namely\
    \ visible and\nNIR. The absence of multispectral data would hinder early disease\
    \ detection, pests\nand weed detection, and vegetation biomass calculation of\
    \ plants. The drawbacks\nof these sensors are high cost and enhanced calibration\
    \ efforts for certain tasks [53].\niii.\nHyperspectral Sensors: The extremely\
    \ capable hyperspectral images can capture\nimages in spatial and spectral ranges.\
    \ These sensors collect light with multiple\nnarrow-size bands for every single\
    \ pixel in the captured image. Furthermore, these\nsensors have area detectors\
    \ for quantifying the captured light that resulted from\nthe incident photon conversion\
    \ into electrons [77]. This conversion is obtained\nthrough two sensors, namely,\
    \ charge-coupled-device (CCD) sensors along with\ncomplementary metal-oxide–semiconductor\
    \ (CMOS) sensors. These sensors are\nused for minimizing the shortcomings of multispectral\
    \ sensors, for capturing infor-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n22 of 32\nmation in lesser\
    \ spectral differences, and for detecting and discriminating against\ntarget objects.\
    \ The commercial success of these sensors in UAVs to measure a\nhundred bands\
    \ and perform data processing is guaranteed. The prime advantage\nof these sensors\
    \ in agriculture is that they can detect plant stress with the disease\nor pathogen\
    \ responsible for it. Major limitations include higher costs and huge\nunnecessary\
    \ data if not properly calibrated [162].\niv.\nThermal Sensors: Thermal sensors\
    \ capture the thermal energy of an object through\noptical lenses and IR sensors\
    \ ﬁt in thermal sensors, which data are then used to\ngenerate images with the\
    \ information collected. These sensors detect the radiation\nrelated to their\
    \ wavelengths and generate heat while converting these radiations\ninto grayscale\
    \ images. Furthermore, they can generate colored images with yellow\nrepresenting\
    \ warmer images and blue representing cooler images [163]. Their costs\nare relatively\
    \ low and RGB sensors with a few modiﬁcations can be converted\ninto thermal sensors.\
    \ These sensors are widely used for agricultural tasks such as\ndisease detection,\
    \ irrigation management, mapping, and monitoring. These sensors\ngenerate images\
    \ with comparatively low resolution and huge data, which is their\nmajor drawback\
    \ [123].\nv.\nDepth Sensors: Depth sensors allow an extra depth of features in\
    \ RGB pixels. The\ndepth is the distance between an object and the depth sensor\
    \ when the image is\ncaptured. These are widely equipped on UAVs for agricultural\
    \ purposes and are\nused to enhance the accuracy of other sensors. LiDAR, red–green–blue–depth\
    \ (RGB-\nD), and time of ﬂight (ToF) are some depth sensors. Light detection and\
    \ ranging\n(LiDAR) is considered the most prevalent depth sensor. The prime difference\
    \ be-\ntween LiDAR and RGB-D is that LiDAR implies laser pulses for distance calculation\n\
    whereas RGB-D is dependent on the light reﬂection intensities [164]. Therefore,\n\
    LiDAR is used more than RGB-D for 3D modeling, disease detection, phenotyping,\n\
    etc. The major drawback is that sometimes these sensors provide lower intensity\n\
    counts as these cannot detect objects after a speciﬁc distance.\nWe list the 2017–2022\
    \ studies in Table 6. This table illustrates different imaging sensors\nand UAV\
    \ types, and their achieved beneﬁts for detecting Scab in Rosaceae fruits and\
    \ other\nfruits. Some prime advantages of using UAVs equipped with sensors are\
    \ accurate and pre-\ncise results in Scab detection, early detection, and monitoring\
    \ of health and growth in plants.\nThese advanced technologies not only save crops\
    \ and time but also enhance production.\nTable 6. Advantages of sensors for acquiring\

    This manuscript discusses UAV imagery for image acquisition and various AI tech-\n\
    niques for image processing for Scab detection in Rosaceae family fruits. Challenges\
    \ in\nScab detection and the recent methodologies to address them are evaluated.\
    \ Miniature\nand high-resolution sensors with ﬂexible UAV platforms, IoT-based\
    \ data storage, solar\ntechnology for batteries, and DL approaches proved to be\
    \ the best solutions to cope with\nthe stated challenges. Employing NN-based models\
    \ for color, shape, and texture extraction\nseparates the infected areas, improves\
    \ the noise robustness and visualization, and enhances\nthe classiﬁcation accuracy.\
    \ Reviewing all the segmentation methods, CNN-based models,\nespecially Mask R-CNN,\
    \ SegNet, and UNet, perform binary and multiclass segmenta-\ntion tasks successfully,\
    \ detect accurate pixel boundaries and minor spots, separate the\npotentially\
    \ Scab-diseased areas, and enhance the identiﬁcation accuracy. Similarly, the\n\
    supervised classiﬁcation methods categorize the healthy and the diseased leaves\
    \ in their\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n24 of 32\nrespective classes appropriately. Among\
    \ them, CNN-based architectures, namely classic\nCNN, VGG, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3,\
    \ outperform other ML and CNN models by\nrestricting operation, complexity, size,\
    \ and other parameters, allowing quick convolution\nand detecting Scab with higher\
    \ accuracy, precision, and G-measure. Being fast and ef-\nﬁcient, UAVs show outstanding\
    \ application prospects in image acquisition of Rosaceae\nfruits among other devices.\
    \ A comparative study of various research shows rotary-wing\nUAVs are extensively\
    \ used for Scab detection; therefore, they are better adapted for use in\nagricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. Different sensors are observed to be utilized, but all these sensors\
    \ have\nmany beneﬁts along with restrictions. Depth sensors are not observed to\
    \ be commonly\nexploited because of their expense. Sections of segmentation, classiﬁcation,\
    \ and sensors\nhave relevant conclusions; thus, it is evident that the fusion\
    \ of AI with UAV imagery has\nthe potential to close the gap between recent trends\
    \ and disease detection.\n9.2. Conclusions\nScab disease in fruits causes food\
    \ insecurity and economic loss. However, Scab detec-\ntion is still challenging\
    \ among researchers and farmers. This manuscript gives preliminary\ninsight into\
    \ the selection of state-of-the-art UAV-based and AI-based techniques for Scab\n\
    detection in Rosaceae family fruits. This paper presents challenging issues associated\
    \ with\nScab detection via UAV imagery and current methodologies that resolve\
    \ these challenges.\nFrom the perspective of an organized framework, it categorizes\
    \ all of the current method-\nologies into three sections, namely feature extraction,\
    \ segmentation and classiﬁcation, and\nUAV imagery. Additionally, an extensive\
    \ literature review is given in all these sections\nalong with the signiﬁcance\
    \ and limitations of each study. In the end, this paper describes\nsome challenges\
    \ that still require further integration efforts to optimize UAV applications\n\
    for Scab detection. This will help UAV imagery to reach milestones in disease\
    \ detection\nand economic stability.\n10. Challenges with Future Prospects\nWith\
    \ technological advancement, certain challenges still require modiﬁcations. In\n\
    this section, we highlight some issues and opportunities of current approaches\
    \ that need\nconsideration in the future. Automation aspects from image acquisition\
    \ to data processing,\ninterpretation, and disease detection will enhance the\
    \ utility of technology. Proper detection\nof diseases with minimal error will\
    \ be possible with better images generated by lightweight\nUAVs and high-resolution\
    \ sensors. Such UAV systems are required that can serve as\nrotary-wing and ﬁxed-wing\
    \ UAVs simultaneously according to the requirement. Enhanced\nﬂight duration and\
    \ reduced costs still require solutions for efﬁciently assessing the overall\n\
    plant status at larger farms and in forests. This will be possible with energy-efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwireless charging systems. Platforms must be capable to alter their speed\
    \ and altitude to\nmanage climatic conditions. Additionally, 3D ﬂight paths will\
    \ be a better option to address\nthe inconsistency in sampling distance from the\
    \ ground.\nMultiple sensors interfaced on combined platforms will be capable to\
    \ reduce payload\nand measure a variety of physiological parameters. The selection\
    \ of sensors and their\nspectral range is aided by the nature of the disease.\
    \ The wider the spectral ranges, the\nbetter will be the differentiation of disease\
    \ symptoms. The image suffers from reﬂections\nand shadows if they are captured\
    \ during daylight. Illumination backscatter X-ray imaging\nneeds to be controlled.\
    \ The low resolution of sensors reﬂects thermal radiation, which\nrequires careful\
    \ calibration of sensors. Accurate thermography will assist thermal sen-\nsors\
    \ in measuring real and accurate temperatures. Furthermore, huge and complex data\n\
    generated by UAVs still require advanced data analysis software. The advanced\
    \ coding\nand data training, and maintenance of this software must be considered\
    \ in the future.\nMoreover, ML algorithms give more accurate results for larger\
    \ datasets, but overcoming\nthe insufﬁciency of larger training and validation\
    \ datasets needs to be developed. All of\nthese expansions will make these technologies\
    \ user-friendly and highly and universally\nadaptable for disease detection.\n\

    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\
    \ as well as how they may affect future studies. The reader will have a \nbetter\
    \ knowledge of the potential of IoT network. \nTurkish Journal of Computer and\

    \ and potential uses. The authors highlight the obstacles \nand prospects in this\
    \ field while discussing the many components of the IoT, such as sensors, communication\
    \ \nnetworks, and data processing systems.The benefits and drawbacks of the IoT\
    \ are explored in this study, along \nwith concerns about privacy, security, and\
    \ standardization. The authors in [4], present an overview of the several \nIoT\
    \ technologies and talk about why it's important for them to work together.The\
    \ vision, architectural aspects, \nand future directions of the IoT are all discussed\
    \ in this article. The authors in [5]present an overview of the \nsupporting technologies,\
    \ including sensors, wireless networks, and cloud computing, and examine the different\
    \ \nIoT applications, such as healthcare, smart homes, and transportation.This\
    \ study examines all aspects of the IoT, \nfrom its definition and structure to\
    \ its potential uses. The writers highlight the challenges and potential in the\
    \ \nfield of IoT and cover its many subjects and developments, such as data analytics,\
    \ security, and standards.The \nauthors in [6], we'll look at the parallels and\
    \ differences between WSNs and the Internet of Things. The authors \ngive a rundown\
    \ of the technologies—sensors, wireless networks, and data processing systems—that\
    \ make \nWSNs and the Internet of Things possible, and then describe their many\
    \ uses in fields like medicine, smart \nhomes, and agriculture.The authors in\
    \ [7], we'll look at how effective resource management is essential to the \n\
    growth of cloud-based vehicle networks. The authors offer a resource management\
    \ paradigm for vehicular \nnetworks in the cloud and then analyze the many issues\
    \ and potential solutions that arise in this setting.The \nauthors in [8]Big data\
    \ analytics and the Internet of Things are discussed in this article and how they\
    \ can be used \nto build smart and connected neighborhoods. The authors in [9]provide\

    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    \ \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2072 \n \n \n \n\
    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\
    \ networks \nprovide a lot of advantages, but they also have some disadvantages\
    \ that need to be dealt with. This includes \nproblems with energy use, battery\
    \ life, interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. It also includes\
    \ \nproblems with network congestion.To fully realize the potential of IoT networks,\
    \ future research should focus \non fixing these problems and overcoming these\
    \ limitations. Managing network congestion, optimizing energy \nuse, creating\
    \ robust security and privacy measures, and resolving interoperability and compatibility\
    \ issues are a \nfew of them.IoT networks, which have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ numerous industries and raise people's \nliving standards everywhere, represent\
    \ a significant advancement in technology. With further research and \ndevelopment,\
    \ IoT networks will without a doubt play a significant role in determining the\
    \ direction of \ntechnology and society. \nReferences \n[1] Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani,\

    \ \n11 \nAbstract \n12 \nUbiquitous technology, big data, more efficient electronic\
    \ health records, and predictive \n13 \nanalytics are now at the core of smart\
    \ healthcare systems supported by artificial intelligence. In \n14 \nthe present\
    \ narrative review, we focus on sensing technologies for the healthcare of Anorexia\
    \ \n15 \nNervosa (AN). We employed a framework inspired by the Interpersonal Neurobiology\
    \ Theory \n16 \n(IPNB), which posits that human experience is characterized by\
    \ a flow of energy and \n17 \ninformation both within us (within our whole body),\
    \ and between us (in the connections we have \n18 \nwith others and with nature).\
    \ In line with this framework, we focused on sensors designed to \n19 \nevaluate\
    \ bodily processes (body sensors: implantable sensors, epidermal sensors, wearable\
    \ and \n20 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n2 \nportable sensors), human\
    \ social interaction (sociometric sensors), and the physical environment \n21\
    \ \n(indoor and outdoor ambient sensors). There is a myriad of man-made sensors\
    \ as well as nature-\n22 \nbased sensors such as plants that can be used to design\
    \ and deploy intelligent systems for human \n23 \nmonitoring and healthcare. In\
    \ conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems can be \n24 \nemployed\
    \ for smarter healthcare of AN and help to relief the burden of health professionals.\
    \ \n25 \nHowever, there are technical, ethical, and environmental sustainability\
    \ issues that must be \n26 \nconsidered prior to implement these systems. A joint\
    \ collaboration of professionals and other \n27 \nmembers of the society involved\
    \ in the healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the \n28 \ndevelopment\
    \ of these systems. The evolution of cyberphysical systems should also be considered\
    \ \n29 \nin these collaborations. \n30 \nKeywords: review, sensors, biosensors,\

    \ systems \n32 \nIntroduction \n33 \nUbiquitous technology, big data, more efficient\
    \ electronic health records, and predictive \n34 \nanalytics are now at the core\
    \ of smart healthcare systems supported by artificial intelligence (AI) \n35 \n\
    [1]. Particularly, the advances in health informatics and sensor technology provide\
    \ several \n36 \npossibilities for a positive transformation of traditional medical\
    \ treatments. For example, \n37 \nintelligent systems can provide real-time feedback\
    \ to electronic devices, the patient, and the \n38 \nphysician, to improve the\
    \ efficiency in healthcare, reduce costs, relieve the burden of health \n39 \n\
    professionals, and more importantly, to enhance human decision making, allowing\
    \ better and \n40 \nmore informed medical decisions for an optimal treatment [2].\
    \ In the present narrative review, we \n41 \nfocus on sensing technologies for\
    \ the healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Although AN is \n42 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT\
    \ SYSTEMS IN AN \n3 \namong the least common mental disorders, AN affects approximately\
    \ 13.6 million people [95% \n43 \nUI: 10.2 – 17.5 million], mostly women, and\
    \ accounts for the most deaths among eating \n44 \ndisorders [3–5]. Moreover,\
    \ the illness course in AN is usually a protracted course that can develop \n\
    45 \ninto a severe-enduring condition with detrimental effects in the health of\
    \ millions of women [6,7]. \n46 \n \nInstead of deep dive into the technical aspects\
    \ of sensor technology, which is not our area \n47 \nof competence, we provide\
    \ an overview of sensing technologies for researchers and health \n48 \nprofessionals\
    \ in the field of eating disorders. Those interested to further explore this technology\
    \ \n49 \ncan use the extensive list of bibliographic references used to elaborate\
    \ this manuscript.  \n50 \nThis study is divided into two major sections. In the\
    \ first section, we introduce sensor \n51 \ntechnology and the framework we will\
    \ use to group the large diversity of sensors. This first \n52 \nsection covers\
    \ body sensors (implantable, epidermal, wearable, and portable), sociometric \n\
    53 \nsensors, and ambient sensors. The second section is dedicated to the implementation\
    \ of \n54 \nintelligent systems for smarter healthcare. \n55 \nSensor technology\
    \ \n56 \nIn general terms, sensors capture and quantify physical phenomena such\
    \ as temperature \n57 \n[8,9]. There is a myriad of sensors for various fields\
    \ such as aerospace technology, agriculture, \n58 \nfood packaging, and healthcare,\
    \ among many others. For example, conventional electrochemical \n59 \nbiosensors\
    \ can detect biofluids in the human body like lactate [10]. More advanced biosensors,\
    \ \n60 \nbased on quantum mechanics and nanomaterials (e.g., polymer, graphene,\
    \ carbon), can detect \n61 \nneurotransmitters like dopamine or serotonin [11–17].\
    \ For example, quantum sensors can be used \n62 \nto detect photons or electromagnetic\
    \ fields at the atomic level, allowing the detection of neural \n63 \nactivity\
    \ [9]. \n64 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n4 \nTherefore, to explore\
    \ the applications of sensors for the healthcare of AN, we employed a \n65 \n\
    framework inspired by Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory [IPNB, 18]. IPNB posits\
    \ that human \n66 \nexperience is characterized by a flow of energy and information\
    \ both within us (within our whole \n67 \nbody), and between us (in the connections\
    \ we have with others and with nature) [18]. In this \n68 \nregard, what we call\
    \ mind, would be “the emergent, self-organizing, embodied, and relational \n69\
    \ \nprocess that that regulates the flow of energy and information” [18(p. 4)].\
    \ In line with this \n70 \nframework, we focus on sensors designed to evaluate\
    \ bodily processes (body sensors), human \n71 \nsocial interaction (sociometrics),\
    \ and the physical environment. \n72 \nBody Sensors \n73 \n \nBody sensors can\
    \ be further divided into different categories. In this review, we \n74 \ncategorize\
    \ them as implantable (injectable, insertable, ingestible), epidermal (skin attached),\
    \ and \n75 \nwearable and portable [19]. \n76 \nImplantable sensors \n77 \nThe\
    \ cardiac pacemaker developed in the 1960s is an illustrative example of one of\
    \ the \n78 \nfirst implantable sensors [19]. Novel heart monitoring devices include\
    \ Mobile Cardiac Outpatient \n79 \nTelemetry (MCOT; CardioNet, Inc.), Reveal LINQ\
    \ (Medtronic), and Implantable Cardioverter \n80 \nDefibrillators (ICDs) such\
    \ as Visia AF devices (Medtronic) for the management of \n81 \ntachyarrhythmia.\
    \ Cardiovascular issues in AN are widely recognized and “are the main cause of\
    \ \n82 \nmorbidity and mortality in AN” [20]. Studies report elevated heart rate\
    \ variability (HRV), \n83 \nbradycardia, and QT interval prolongation (that is,\
    \ from the Q wave to the end of the T wave in \n84 \nan electrocardiogram), the\
    \ latter two associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias \n85 \n\
    [20,21]. \n86 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n5 \nIn this regard, a\
    \ recent study reported a sensor capable of providing interoceptive \n87 \nstimulation\
    \ to enhance HRV [22]. Interoception deficits (i.e., the difficulty to accurate\
    \ identify \n88 \ninternal physiological signals like hunger or satiety), have\
    \ been identified as a key symptom in \n89 \nnetwork analysis of AN psychopathology\
    \ [23]. Therefore, there is a venue for further research on \n90 \nthe autonomic\
    \ nervous system in AN [24], using sensing technology. \n91 \nImplantable sensors\
    \ can also be used for neural sensing (e.g., brain neural recording), \n92 \n\
    intracranial neurostimulation (invasive deep brain stimulation, DBS), neuromodulation,\
    \ and \n93 \nneurofeedback [25,26,35,36,27–34]. The neuroanatomical areas of major\
    \ interest for the treatment of \n94 \nAN have been the brain’s subcallosal cingulate\
    \ cortex and the nucleus accumbens [34,37–39,e.g., 40]. \n95 \nOther reports include\
    \ the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) [26], the bed nucleus of the stria\
    \ \n96 \nterminalis [41], and the ventral anterior limb of the capsula interna\
    \ [42]. Most of these studies have \n97 \nfocused on eating behavior and weight\
    \ gain as indicators of successful outcomes [e.g., 43], and \n98 \nmuch less on\
    \ body image issues [e.g., 40]. First, it is important to recognize that weight\
    \ gain is just \n99 \none of many other important markers of a successful treatment\
    \ outcome [31]. Second, it is also \n100 \nworth noting the caveats of implementing\
    \ intracranial sensors (e.g., undergoing neurosurgery, \n101 \nusing durable and\
    \ flexible biocompatible materials, cytotoxicity) [32], and most importantly the\
    \ \n102 \nethical concerns that can generate these interventions [e.g., 44,45].\
    \ \n103 \nImplantable brain sensing technologies have raised many interests among\
    \ scholars, health \n104 \nprofessionals, patients, business companies, and the\
    \ public through the media depiction of brain-\n105 \ncomputer interfaces [46].\
    \ However, it has raised concerns about ethical issues related to the use \n106\
    \ \nand misuse of neurotechnologies [44,47–55]. In this regard, it is important\
    \ to consider both ethical \n107 \nissues and future directions, prior to adopting\
    \ implantable neural devices and neurostimulation \n108 \n[56–58]. \n109 \nSENSORS\
    \ AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n6 \nOther than heart and brain sensors, there\
    \ are also implantable biosensors for tracking \n110 \ndiverse biochemical substances\
    \ and processes in the human body. There are several chemical \n111 \nsubstances\
    \ of interest (biomarkers) for the treatment of AN. For example, individuals with\
    \ AN \n112 \ncommonly present an endocrine dysregulation associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary\
    \ axis, \n113 \nand more precisely the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and\
    \ the hypothalamic-pituitary-\n114 \nadrenal axis [59]. This endocrine dysregulation\
    \ is associated with a series of symptoms in AN \n115 \nsuch as amenorrhea and\
    \ bone loss. Indeed, AN is usually associated with low bone mineral \n116 \ndensity\
    \ and osteoporosis (i.e., skeletal fragility due to bone loss) [60]. In this regard,\
    \ there are \n117 \nimplantable biosensors for monitoring bone health [61]. In\
    \ other words, biosensors can help \n118 \nmonitor a series of biochemicals associated\
    \ with this endocrine dysregulation, including \n119 \nadipokines and gut peptides\
    \ related to energy balance, hunger and satiety (e.g., Leptin, Ghrelin, \n120\
    \ \nNeuropeptide Y, Peptide YY), hormones related to the menstrual cycle, stress,\
    \ sleep, and others \n121 \n(e.g., oxytocin, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone,\
    \ gonadotropin-releasing hormone, \n122 \nprogesterone, testosterone, estradiol,\
    \ cortisol, etc.), and even key processes such as the \n123 \nchronobiology of\
    \ hormones [2,62–66]. Clearly, there are many possibilities to integrate implantable\
    \ \n124 \nbiosensors in the healthcare and treatment of AN. However, once again,\
    \ it is important to \n125 \nevaluate the ethical trade-offs. \n126 \nImplantable\
    \ biosensors can also be used in the design of implantable drug delivery \n127\
    \ \nsystems to release localized and controlled amounts of drugs [2]. Thus, a\
    \ venue of interest for \n128 \nthese biosensors is its use in the design of nanoscale\
    \ drug delivery systems, such as plant-based \n129 \nnanotechnology (phytonanotechnology)\
    \ for the delivery of herbal drugs [67,68]. For example, there \n130 \nis a “renaissance”\
    \ in the interest for psychedelics like the non-synthetic ayahuasca, psilocybin,\
    \ \n131 \nmescaline, peyote [69]. Studies have shown promising effects of psychedelics\
    \ on key evolved \n132 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n7 \npsychological\
    \ mechanisms like cognitive flexibility [70,71]. Cognitive flexibility (i.e.,\
    \ the ability to \n133 \nshift perspective to adapt to a changing environment\
    \ or a new habitat), and in a more general \n134 \nway behavior flexibility (e.g.,\
    \ to anticipate others’ actions and acting accordingly), have \n135 \nevolutive\
    \ roots that allow developmental adaptation throughout life [see 72–74]. Individuals\
    \ with \n136 \nAN display lower cognitive flexibility compared to healthy controls,\
    \ although most suitable \n137 \nassessment tools are necessary to better explain\
    \ this deficit and differences [75–77]. Future studies \n138 \ncan evaluate the\
    \ use of biosensors to design implantable drug delivery systems that employ \n\
    139 \npsychedelics such as ayahuasca or psilocybin to enhance key adaptive psychological\
    \ \n140 \nmechanisms like cognitive flexibility in AN. A similar approach can\
    \ be used in the design of \n141 \nnutrient delivery systems to improve nutrient\
    \ bioavailability [e.g., 78], in individuals with AN. \n142 \nOther group of implantable\
    \ biosensors are ingestible sensors for gastrointestinal \n143 \nmonitoring [19,79].\
    \ For example, the SmartPill motility testing system (Medtronic) includes a \n\
    144 \nsmart pill that travels through the gastrointestinal tract and a software\
    \ that provides valuable \n145 \nsensor data such as gastric emptying time, colonic\
    \ transit time, pH, temperature and pressure \n146 \nfrom the antrum and duodenum\
    \ (https://www.medtronic.com/). Other smart pills have been \n147 \ndesigned to\
    \ sample the gut microbiome [80]. Individuals with AN present a series of \n148\
    \ \ngastrointestinal complications including constipation and bloating, with decreased\
    \ gastric \n149 \nmotility and delayed gastric emptying as the most common underlying\
    \ causes, although the \n150 \ncauses of gastric dysmotility in AN require further\
    \ research [81]. Regarding the gut microbiota, \n151 \npreliminary results suggest\
    \ that further research is needed to better characterize the gut \n152 \nmicrobiome\
    \ in AN [82–84]. Future research can use ingestible sensors to monitor these \n\
    153 \ngastrointestinal complications and provide a better profile of the gut microbiome\
    \ in AN. \n154 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n8 \nFinally, an emergent\
    \ technology of implantable body sensing that is attracting the \n155 \nattention\
    \ of scientists, inventors, and companies is smart dust, considered “the future\
    \ of humans \n156 \nmonitoring” [85]. Based on technologies such as complementary\
    \ metal-oxide-semiconductor \n157 \n(CMOS) and microelectromechanical systems\
    \ (MEMS), a smart dust system can consist of \n158 \nthousands of sensor nodes\
    \ or motes (below 100 μm of size and ultra-low powered), which can \n159 \nsense\
    \ chemicals, light, magnetism, vibration, acceleration, and temperature [85].\
    \ For human \n160 \nmonitoring, these sensor nodes can be inserted in the human\
    \ body (e.g., by drinking water), and \n161 \nneural dust and body dust are probably\
    \ the most relevant of these technologies for mental \n162 \nhealthcare. Neural\
    \ dust is expected to provide neural recording and neural stimulation [85–87].\
    \ \n163 \nHowever, the present size of these devices (at a millimeter scale) is\
    \ still a limitation, and brain \n164 \nactivity recording via neural dust is\
    \ still at the conceptual and simulation level [85]. Similarly, \n165 \nbody dust\
    \ is expected to track key biochemical reaction pathways (i.e., metabolic pathways,\
    \ \n166 \nsignaling pathways) involved in human biological systems. Different\
    \ efforts are being made to \n167 \ndownscale the size of these sensors and turn\
    \ them feasible to produce and use [88,89]. This \n168 \nadvancement in the miniaturization\
    \ of sensing technologies coupled with nanomaterials with \n169 \noutstanding\
    \ properties (e.g., graphene composites), optoelectronics (i.e., using light for\
    \ sensing, \n170 \nrecording, stimulating, and controlling), and quantum sensing\
    \ [9], for the development of \n171 \noptoneuroelectronic or optoelectrophysiology\
    \ devices [87,90], could also help bring innovations in \n172 \nthis area. \n\
    173 \nIn the future, more individuals with AN could eventually benefit from implantable\
    \ \n174 \nsensing technology. However, it is important to highlight that the need\
    \ to use these technologies \n175 \nshould be evaluated prior to its implementation\
    \ in the treatment of AN. In the case they are \n176 \napproved, they should be\
    \ used under strict regulation to accomplish ethical guidelines and \n177 \nSENSORS\
    \ AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n9 \nrecommendations. Moreover, we suggest that\
    \ implantable biosensors should not be used as a \n178 \nstandalone device, but\
    \ rather used as the first layer of a smart healthcare system aimed to provide\
    \ \n179 \npersonalized care in the treatment of individuals with AN. \n180 \n\
    Epidermal sensors \n181 \nMost biosensors are usually minimally invasive and can\
    \ monitor, for example, glucose \n182 \nlevels [91]. This noninvasive approach\
    \ is commonly employed to measure physiological signals \n183 \nlike pulse or\
    \ heart rate by attaching sensors to the skin [66]. These epidermal sensors are\
    \ skin-\n184 \ninspired electronics typically ultrathin, soft, and stretchable,\
    \ giving the appearance of a second \n185 \nskin or tattoo [10,66,92]. An example\
    \ of this technology is the 5x5mm Lab-on-Skin sensing chip \n186 \ndeveloped by\
    \ Xsensio (https://xsensio.com), to track biomarkers in human sweat [93,94]. Similar\
    \ \n187 \nsoft and flexible electrochemical bioelectronics have been developed\
    \ with the appearance of a \n188 \nwristband or band aid to measure sweat samples\
    \ [e.g., 95,96], wound pH [e.g., 97], pulse, breath, and \n189 \nbody movement\
    \ [e.g., 98], among others [10]. \n190 \nIndividuals with AN are known to present\
    \ altered physiological responses to certain \n191 \nstimuli like high calorie\
    \ food (e.g., ice cream, pizza) [99] or images of human bodies (e.g., their \n\
    192 \nown body, ultra-thin female bodies) [100]. Therefore, there are several\
    \ opportunities to use \n193 \nepidermal sensors for the continuous measurement\
    \ of various physiological responses in AN. For \n194 \nexample. electrodermal\
    \ activity (EDA) epidermal sensors to monitor skin conductance response \n195\
    \ \n(galvanic skin response), together with epidermal sensors of heart rate, and\
    \ cortisol, can provide \n196 \noverall a continuous real-time measurement of\
    \ stress levels, as it can be done with commercial \n197 \ndevices [e.g., 101].\
    \ However, it should be noted that epidermal sensors are commercially less \n\
    198 \ndeveloped compared with wearable commercial sensors that have been used\
    \ more frequently \n199 \n[101,102]. In any case it is important to highlight\
    \ that both require a rigorous validation involving \n200 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT\
    \ SYSTEMS IN AN \n10 \nthe preprocessing of raw data (e.g., noise reduction),\
    \ signal processing, and feature extraction \n201 \n[103,104]. \n202 \nWearable\
    \ and portable sensors \n203 \n \nPerhaps the most famous sensors among consumers\
    \ are wearable sensors such as smart \n204 \nwatches and portable sensors such\
    \ as smartphones that incorporate a camera, accelerometer, \n205 \ngyroscope,\
    \ light detection, etc. The main difference between the epidermal sensors mentioned\
    \ \n206 \nabove and the wearable sensors mentioned here, are that the former are\
    \ ultrathin, soft, and \n207 \nflexible skin attached sensors, whereas the latter\
    \ are commonly rigid and not exclusively used in \n208 \ncontact with the skin.\
    \ Examples of wearable and portable sensor devices include: mobile \n209 \nelectroencephalography\
    \ (EEG), smart glasses (including eye-tracker glasses), smart contact lens \n\
    210 \n(rigid, soft), helmet, headband, earring, earpiece, fingertip, rigid wristband,\
    \ belt, smart textiles \n211 \n(e.g., bra, shirt, sock), fork [19]. As can be\
    \ seen, there are different wearable and portable devices, \n212 \nbut we will\
    \ cover just three devices of interest for the healthcare and treatment of AN,\
    \ prior to \n213 \ncovering wearable biosensors. \n214 \n \nThe first sensor of\
    \ interest is the portable Sensing Fork designed by Kadomura et al. [105] \n215\
    \ \nas part of a mobile based system to promote healthy eating among children.\
    \ What is interesting \n216 \nabout this system is that it integrates several\
    \ elements of an intelligent system: a sensor, a \n217 \ngamified smartphone application\
    \ (App), a food type classifier, an eating action classifier, and \n218 \nfeedback\
    \ to the user [105]. A similar device, the HAPIfork, has been developed by the\
    \ company \n219 \nHapilabs (https://hapilabs.com). \n220 \n \nMobile EEG sensors\
    \ are commonly used as a brain-computer interface (BCI) to track \n221 \nbrain\
    \ neural activity [106,107], and to provide neurofeedback in controlled settings\
    \ [e.g., 108,109], or “in \n222 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n11 \n\
    the wild” through mobile phone apps for consumers (e.g., the Muse headband). Although\
    \ \n223 \ncompared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has a poorer\
    \ spatial resolution, it \n224 \nhas good temporal resolution, it is portable,\
    \ and inexpensive [110]. The United States has funded \n225 \nresearch on BCI\
    \ through “the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army \n\
    226 \nResearch Lab, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and other organizations”\
    \ [111,112]. Although \n227 \nmost of the funding focused on neuroprosthetics\
    \ for the treatment of patients with traumatic \n228 \nbrain injury, major limb\
    \ amputation, among others; it had an enormous impact on the \n229 \ndevelopment\
    \ of companies interested in commercializing BCI-based solutions [113]. Among\
    \ the \n230 \nmost popular BCI devices we have the open hardware OpenBCI, the\
    \ Emotiv EPOC, the Muse \n231 \nheadband, and the NeuroSky’s EEG biosensor. \n\
    232 \n \nEye-trackers are other well-known sensors used for various purposes including\
    \ research \n233 \non advertising [114,e.g., 115], gender attitudes [e.g., 116],\
    \ body-related attentional bias [e.g., 117], and \n234 \neating disorders [e.g.,\
    \ 118–121]. Although desktop eye-tracking devices are by far more precise, \n\
    235 \nwearable eye-trackers provide descent resolution and sampling rates [122].\
    \ Popular eye-trackers \n236 \ninclude: Pupil Labs glasses, Tobii glasses, SMI\
    \ glasses, and low-cost solutions like RemoteEye \n237 \n[123]. \n238 \n \nFinally,\
    \ wearable biosensors employ a biological recognition element (receptor) and a\
    \ \n239 \ntransducer (e.g., electrode) to detect biofluids [124,125]. Biosensors\
    \ can use different receptors, \n240 \nsuch as enzymatic electrochemical biosensors\
    \ to detect glucose, uric acid, lactate, and hydrogen \n241 \nperoxide; intact\
    \ living cells to work as cell sensors and microbial sensors; antibodies to act\
    \ as \n242 \nimmunosensors, and even nucleic acids (e.g., aptamers) to recognize\
    \ molecules [125]. Therefore, \n243 \nwearable biosensors can have different functionality,\
    \ such as detecting metabolic parameters \n244 \n(e.g., pH, electrolytes), physiological\
    \ signals (e.g., heart rate, skin temperature), and even toxic \n245 \nSENSORS\
    \ AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n12 \nchemicals like organophosphate compounds\
    \ [126]. A recent review of electrochemical affinity \n246 \nbiosensors details\
    \ a series of devices to detect hormones and metabolites that can be of relevance\
    \ \n247 \nfor the treatment of AN, like the aforementioned cortisol, leptin, ghrelin,\
    \ growth hormone, \n248 \nestradiol, among others [65]. \n249 \n \nWearable biosensor\
    \ devices worth mentioning include contact lenses and eyeglasses for \n250 \n\
    tear biosensing [127,128], the 61 x 41 x 5.5 mm VivaLINK (https://www.vivalink.com/)\
    \ axillary \n251 \npatch to measure temperature, the 90 x 20 x 7.9 mm cardiac\
    \ patch from the same company, \n252 \ntextile sensors (smart textile) for sweat\
    \ analysis [129], to name just a few. In fact, the list of \n253 \nwearable biosensors\
    \ and their applications is so extensive that we refer the reader to previous\
    \ \n254 \nwork [19,66,103,124,126,130–133]. \n255 \nSociometric Sensors \n256\
    \ \nThe quantity and quality of interpersonal relationships exert a strong influence\
    \ in shaping \n257 \nthe individual’s affect, cognition, and behavior. Social\
    \ network analysis has been used for a long \n258 \ntime to study human social\
    \ interaction [e.g., 134]. Traditional sociometric techniques employ self-\n259\
    \ \nreports about friendships and networks, providing a valuable but limited view\
    \ of human \n260 \ninteractions [e.g., 135]. In this regard, computational science\
    \ methods that include sensing \n261 \ntechnology, social physics, and simulations\
    \ can provide accurate measures of human social \n262 \ninteraction and remarkably\
    \ precise predictions of individual and collective human behavior \n263 \n[136,137].\
    \ Therefore, in this group, we consider as a sociometric sensor any sensor (i.e.,\
    \ \n264 \nimplantable, epidermal, wearable, portable) that can provide relevant\
    \ social data. \n265 \nFor example, the growing adoption of 5G technology and\
    \ pervasive wireless sensors in smart \n266 \nspaces (i.e., smart cities, smart\
    \ organizations including smart hospitals, and smart homes), \n267 \nSENSORS AND\
    \ INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n13 \nprovide a fine-grained collection of social\
    \ signals, allowing a continuous remote monitoring of \n268 \nhuman daily life\
    \ activities and social interactions. In this scenario, sociometric sensor devices\
    \ \n269 \nhave been developed to provide accurate measures of interpersonal proximity\
    \ and verbal \n270 \ncommunication [138–141]. Sociometric data collected by sensors\
    \ in daily life settings can be used to \n271 \nexamine peer processes and family\
    \ processes in AN with the possibility to identify cliques (e.g., \n272 \ngroup\
    \ of friends), influence agents in the network, and key communication and interaction\
    \ \n273 \nprocesses known to shape social norms within groups [142]. Similarly,\
    \ sociometric sensors can be \n274 \nused to examine group interactions, communication,\
    \ collaboration, and overall group dynamics \n275 \n[143], among healthcare professionals\
    \ [144]. In sum, methodologies from computer science and \n276 \nsocial sciences\
    \ (i.e., computational social sciences), can be employed for social data mining\
    \ (e.g., \n277 \nusing sociometric sensors), social signal processing [145], simulation\
    \ (e.g., agent-based models), \n278 \nand interventions [e.g., 146]. \n279 \n\
    Ambient Sensors \n280 \n \nIn this category, we basically have outdoor and indoor\
    \ ambient sensors. Regarding \n281 \noutdoor sensors, many urban cities are equipped\
    \ with environment-embedded sensors to measure \n282 \nphysical conditions such\
    \ as humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind for weather \n283 \n\
    forecasting. In fact, there are several types of outdoor sensors: soil moisture\
    \ sensors for irrigation \n284 \nmanagement; air quality sensors to track pollution,\
    \ and city cameras, including thermal cameras \n285 \nand AI cameras, for security,\
    \ traffic management, people counting, monitoring energy \n286 \ntransformers\
    \ to avoid overheating, etc.  \n287 \nAlong these sensors, we have satellite data,\
    \ location data, and a geographic information \n288 \nsystem (GIS) to, for example,\
    \ map the surrounding built environment of citizens. Although all \n289 \nthese\
    \ data from ambient sensors and geolocation apparently seem disparate, we can\
    \ use computer \n290 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n14 \nvision, signal\
    \ processing, simulation, machine learning and AI, to analyze a built environment,\
    \ \n291 \nidentify patterns like individual and group human behavior within cities,\
    \ and predict future \n292 \npatterns [e.g., 147]. \n293 \n \nThe built environment\
    \ of a neighborhood has an important effect on health behaviors. For \n294 \n\
    example, built environments can facilitate open air physical activity if they\
    \ provide suitable \n295 \ninfrastructure like walking paths [148]. Similarly,\
    \ healthy food availability and accessibility in \n296 \nliving surroundings can\
    \ facilitate healthy eating [149]. Individuals with AN struggle with food and\
    \ \n297 \nit could be even worse if the surrounding living environment does not\
    \ provide healthy food \n298 \nchoices (e.g., the so-called “food deserts”) or\
    \ food that fits a personally tailored nutrition [150,151]. \n299 \nFurthermore,\
    \ high levels of physical activity are common in individuals with AN [152,153],\
    \ and this \n300 \noveractivity has been linked to thermoregulation and ambient\
    \ temperature [154], both of which can \n301 \nbe measured with sensors. \n302\
    \ \n \nTherefore, environment-embedded sensors can be implemented in indoor and\
    \ outdoor \n303 \nspaces to measure diverse conditions like temperature, ambient\
    \ radio signals (e.g., Wi-Fi), air \n304 \nquality, location, etc. Then, we can\
    \ integrate the information of the built environment that \n305 \nsurrounds individuals\
    \ with AN with the data of their indoor living conditions, into intelligent \n\
    306 \nsystems for healthcare monitoring. For example, weather forecasting data\
    \ with previous \n307 \nindividual’s mobility and sleep patterns [155], could\
    \ predict physical overactivity in outdoors in \n308 \nAN. An intelligent system\
    \ that integrates this information together with real-time air quality data \n\
    309 \n[e.g., 156], can send a SMS reminder to the user to avoid excessive exercise\
    \ and reduce his exposure \n310 \nto air pollution, the latter linked to cardiovascular\
    \ diseases [157,158]. In a similar fashion, data from \n311 \nglobal positioning\
    \ system (GPS) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been used to \n312\
    \ \nmonitor the food environment, and food and eating patterns [159].  \n313 \n\
    SENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n15 \n \nAs we will see below [see also\
    \ 160], there are many other opportunities to integrate ambient \n314 \nsensors\
    \ in intelligent systems for healthcare monitoring.  \n315 \nIntelligent systems\
    \ \n316 \n \nIntelligent systems for healthcare monitoring can be designed to\
    \ relieve the burden of \n317 \nhealthcare professionals, reduce costs, and improve\
    \ the treatment of individuals with AN. In this \n318 \nregard, it is important\
    \ to integrate sensor data with traditional data from the clinical history and\
    \ \n319 \nphysical examination, laboratory tests, self-reports, etc.  \n320 \n\
    \ \nFirst, given that we can acquire data from multiple sensors, sensor fusion\
    \ is \n321 \nrecommended to enhance the quality of the data collected by the sensors\
    \ [161]. For example, if the \n322 \nsignal of a heart sensor is affected by noise\
    \ (e.g., movement), heart data from additional sensors \n323 \ncan ensure the\
    \ reliability of heart monitoring [161]. Similarly, sensor fusion can be used\
    \ to obtain \n324 \ndata that cannot be obtained by isolated sensor data [161].\
    \  \n325 \nThen, the architecture to process these multisensor sensor data can\
    \ be a decentralized \n326 \ndistributed architecture [162,163], like a network\
    \ of nodes with a hierarchical structure.  \nFor \n327 \nexample, we can employ\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are networks of scattered \n328 \nwireless\
    \ sensors to collect diverse physical data from the environment [164], together\
    \ with \n329 \nWireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) that comprise body sensors\
    \ located in different parts of \n330 \nthe body [98,161]. The first layer in\
    \ this hierarchy constitutes the edge computing layer that \n331 \nretrieves the\
    \ data from, for example, body sensors, RFIDs, etc. These data are forwarded to\
    \ a fog \n332 \ncomputing layer (e.g., a Raspberry Pi, a smartphone), which acts\
    \ as the connecting link between \n333 \nthe edge layer and the cloud computing\
    \ (the highest layer in this hierarchy), reducing latency and \n334 \nenhancing\
    \ efficiency [165]. Finally, cloud computing can be leveraged to perform the most\
    \ \n335 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n16 \narduous tasks, including\
    \ the use of artificial intelligence (e.g., graph neural networks) for \n336 \n\
    classification and predictive analytics.  \n337 \nAlthough, the need to use cloud\
    \ services should be evaluated in terms of cybersecurity, \n338 \nprivacy, confidentiality,\
    \ and environmental sustainability [162]. Moreover, improvements in radio \n339\
    \ \ntechnology (e.g., 6G standard, autonomous, dynamic, distributed, adaptive\
    \ wireless networks), \n340 \nwill allow more efficient infrastructures depending\
    \ less in remote cloud services. For example, \n341 \nAmazon Web Service (AWS)\
    \ Wavelength (https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/features/) is a \n342 \nmobile\
    \ edge computing infrastructure that embeds AWS services within 5G networks, reducing\
    \ \n343 \nthe need for mobile applications to heavily rely on remote cloud servers.\
    \ \n344 \n \nThere are several examples of a three-layer architecture for healthcare\
    \ monitoring. Niu et \n345 \nal. [98], developed the bodyNET system that employs\
    \ five wearable epidermal sensor nodes and \n346 \nsmart textiles that operate\
    \ with a smartphone via bluetooth, and a cloud server via cellular \n347 \nnetwork,\
    \ for pulse detection, breath detection, and body movement detection. Similar\
    \ systems \n348 \nhave been used for tracking eating behavior [166], to predict\
    \ heart failure [167,168], and mental \n349 \nhealth issues such as depression\
    \ [169]. \n350 \n \nHowever, perhaps the most promising venue of intelligent systems\
    \ in healthcare is to \n351 \nprovide tailored interventions at real-time using\
    \ mobile health (mHealth) technology, digital twin \n352 \n(e.g., a digital replica\
    \ of a patient), social robotics, or others. That is the case of digital just-in-\n\
    353 \ntime adaptive interventions (JITAIs) or ecological momentary interventions\
    \ [170–174], that can \n354 \nadopt a human-aware AI (or human-centered AI, i.e.,\
    \ AI systems that are centered on the user) \n355 \napproach [175] and a context-aware\
    \ approach [168,174]. In this case, these intelligent systems are \n356 \ngrounded\
    \ in both evidence-based interventions (e.g., behavior change theories) and continuous\
    \ \n357 \nlearning (e.g., reinforcement learning), to provide a user-friendly\
    \ experience tailored to the needs \n358 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN\
    \ AN \n17 \nof the user. For example, a JITAIs can be a gamified mobile App grounded\
    \ in Cognitive \n359 \nBehavioral Therapy (CBT), and the mechanisms of behavior\
    \ change [176,177], that delivers \n360 \nreminders or instructions to support\
    \ decision making, behavior change, activities of daily life, \n361 \netc. These\
    \ alerts can benefit individuals with AN and those monitoring their treatment\
    \ [170]. \n362 \nSensing technologies can be key in designing these intelligent\
    \ systems, and these systems can be \n363 \nintegrated together with traditional\
    \ interventions to provide a smarter healthcare in AN. \n364 \nDiscussion \n365\
    \ \n \nThis review focused on the integration of sensor technology and intelligent\
    \ systems, to \n366 \nprovide smarter healthcare delivery systems in Anorexia\
    \ Nervosa (AN). Through this narrative \n367 \nreview, we have seen that to design\
    \ and deploy these intelligent systems, we require the effort of \n368 \nprofessionals\
    \ from diverse fields. Domain expertise in the field of eating disorders, healthcare\
    \ \n369 \nmanagement, sensor technologies, internet of things (IoT), big data,\
    \ data science, artificial \n370 \nintelligence is required, among others. However,\
    \ global challenges such as the COVID-19 \n371 \npandemics or climate change,\
    \ have demonstrated that the deployment of intelligent systems is \n372 \nfeasible\
    \ through cooperation and consilience across different disciplines, and it fosters\
    \ \n373 \ninnovation scaling [178]. \n374 \nCurrent interventions that use technology,\
    \ particularly mobile technology (i.e., mHealth \n375 \ninterventions), for the\
    \ treatment of eating disorders such as AN are scarce, but the use of \n376 \n\
    evidence-based techniques, gamification, and the possibility of remote monitoring\
    \ and guidance \n377 \nare just some of the factors that can make them attractive\
    \ for patients and clinicians [179–182]. \n378 \nTherefore, as we have seen above,\
    \ there are several opportunities to integrate sensing technology \n379 \nand\
    \ foster innovation in the field of eating disorders, particularly in healthcare\
    \ settings. Anorexia \n380 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n18 \nNervosa\
    \ affects the lives of millions of women and is a chronic condition that deserves\
    \ the \n381 \ncareful attention of health professionals but can create a burden\
    \ among them. Sensing \n382 \ntechnologies can relieve this burden if they are\
    \ used not only to provide data, but particularly if \n383 \nthey are embedded\
    \ in intelligent systems for smarter healthcare of patients with eating disorder.\
    \ \n384 \n \nIn this regard, we highlight the fact that there is a fast development\
    \ in the manufacture of \n385 \nnew and low-cost electronic devices, particularly\
    \ in modern cities like Shenzhen (China). We \n386 \nhave mentioned above that\
    \ these new technologies, like polymer and graphene composite-based \n387 \nnanosensors,\
    \ quantum sensors, will be the future of human monitoring. As we also mentioned,\
    \ \n388 \nthere are ethical concerns that arise from ubiquitous technologies.\
    \ However, we must also \n389 \nmention environmental and sustainability issues\
    \ related to the manufacture of sensor \n390 \ntechnologies. For example, intelligent\
    \ cameras with computer vision capabilities can be used for \n391 \nhealthcare\
    \ but require higher power consumption and materials like lithium or gold, that\
    \ usually \n392 \nhave high and hidden environmental costs. In summary, it is\
    \ important to recognize along the \n393 \nethical issues mentioned above, the\
    \ environmental sustainability of the manufacture and use of \n394 \nthese sensors.\
    \ Future research should consider alternatives to man-made sensors, such as nature-\n\
    395 \nbased biosensors. For example, plants used as sensors (phytosensors), are\
    \ a more sustainable \n396 \nalternative, have higher sensitivity and specificity,\
    \ and can be used for human monitoring [183,184]. \n397 \n \nFinally, we have\
    \ shown how sensor technologies can be integrated in the treatment of AN \n398\
    \ \nthrough the design and deployment of intelligent systems supported by artificial\
    \ intelligence. In \n399 \nthis regard, it is worth mentioning that there are\
    \ established network standards (e.g., IEEE \n400 \n802.15.6 for WBANs), device\
    \ standards (e.g., IEEE/ISO 11073-10420-2010 for body \n401 \ncomposition analysis),\
    \ and communication standards (e.g., Proxy Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 by the \n402 \n\
    Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF) for these systems. However, to implement\
    \ more \n403 \nSENSORS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN AN \n19 \nadvanced and future\
    \ intelligent systems, we need to design new standards and protocols that \n404\
    \ \nrequire the collaboration and synergy of different professionals. To give\
    \ an example, there is a \n405 \njoint effort to build cyberphysical social systems,\
    \ which includes what is called Societies 5.0, a \n406 \nnew paradigm to modeling\
    \ and managing complex systems such as societies [185,186]. The \n407 \ntransition\
    \ towards these cyberphysical social systems, and more particularly cyberphysical\
    \ \n408 \nmedical systems [187], urgently requires interdisciplinary collaboration\
    \ [188]. For example, there \n409 \nare cybersecurity issues, like cyberattacks\
    \ to healthcare devices [187], that can be solved with \n410 \nsecured protocols\
    \ and standards [189,190]. Importantly, cyberphysical social systems can be used\
    \ \n411 \nfor behavior monitoring [191], and therefore they have a great potential\
    \ for smarter healthcare at \n412 \nthe individual and population level.  \n413\
    \ \nConclusions \n414 \nIn conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems\
    \ can be designed and deployed \n415 \nfor smarter healthcare for AN. However,\
    \ there are technical, ethical, and environmental \n416 \nsustainability issues\
    \ that must be considered prior to implement these systems. A joint \n417 \ncollaboration\
    \ of professionals and other members of the society involved in the healthcare\
    \ of \n418 \nindividuals with AN can help in the development of these systems.\
    \ The evolution of \n419 \ncyberphysical systems should be considered in these\
    \ collaborations. \n420 \nConflicts of interest \n421 \nAuthors do not have conflicts\

    \ AND APPLICATIONS\nMuhammad Zaigham Abbas Shah, Syed\nNovember 8, 2022\nInternet\
    \ of Things is a system that integrates different devices and technologies,\n\
    removing the necessity of human intervention. This enables the capacity of having\n\
    smart (or smarter) cities around the world. By hosting different technologies\
    \ and al-\nlowing interactions between them, the internet of things has spearheaded\
    \ the develop-\nment of smart city systems for sustainable living, increased comfort\
    \ and productivity\nfor citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities\
    \ has many different domains\nand draws upon various underlying systems for its\
    \ operation, in this work, we provide\na holistic coverage of the Internet of\
    \ Things in Smart Cities by discussing the fun-\ndamental components that make\
    \ up the IoT Smart City landscape, the technologies\nthat enable these domains\
    \ to exist, the most prevalent practices and techniques which\nare used in these\
    \ domains as well as the challenges that deployment of IoT systems for\nsmart\
    \ cities encounter and which need to be addressed for ubiquitous use of smart\
    \ city\napplications. It also presents a coverage of optimization methods and\
    \ applications\nfrom a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things.\
    \ Towards this end,\na mapping is provided for the most encountered applications\
    \ of computational opti-\nmization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization\
    \ methods, ant colony\noptimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization,\
    \ artificial bee colony op-\ntimization and differential evolution. For each application\
    \ identified, the algorithms\nused, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation\
    \ and constraints taken in\nv\nto account have been specified and discussed. Lastly,\
    \ the data setup used by each\ncovered work is also mentioned and directions for\
    \ future work have been identified.\nWithin the smart health domain of IoT smart\
    \ cities, human activity recognition\nhas been a key study topic in the development\
    \ of cyber physical systems and as-\nsisted living applications. In particular,\
    \ inertial sensor based systems have become\nincreasingly popular because they\
    \ do not restrict users’ movement and are also rel-\natively simple to implement\
    \ compared to other approaches. Fall detection is one of\nthe most important tasks\
    \ in human activity recognition. With an increasingly aging\nworld population\
    \ and an inclination by the elderly to live alone, the need to incor-\nporate\
    \ dependable fall detection schemes in smart devices such as phones, watches\n\
    has gained momentum. Therefore, differentiating between falls and activities of\
    \ daily\nliving (ADLs) has been the focus of researchers in recent years with\
    \ very good results.\nHowever, one aspect within fall detection that has not been\
    \ investigated much is di-\nrection and severity aware fall detection. Since a\
    \ fall detection system aims to detect\nfalls in people and notify medical personnel,\
    \ it could be of added value to health pro-\nfessionals tending to a patient suffering\
    \ from a fall to know the nature of the accident.\nIn this regard, as a case study\
    \ for smart health, four different experiments have been\nconducted for the task\
    \ of fall detection with direction and severity consideration on\ntwo publicly\
    \ available datasets. These four experiments not only tackle the problem\non an\
    \ increasingly complicated level (the first one considers a fall only scenario\
    \ and\nthe other two a combined activity of daily living and fall scenario) but\
    \ also present\nmethodologies which outperform the state of the art techniques\
    \ as discussed. Lastly,\nfuture recommendation have also been provided for researchers.\n\

    Motivation\nThe world is experiencing a bulging world population and increasing\
    \ urbanization\nwhich is set to grow by more than 10% in the next 30 years [1]\
    \ resulting in a total\nof 70% living in cities by 2050. Countries around the\
    \ world are looking at equipping\ntheir cities to deal with the influx of people\
    \ and the stress it will bring to current\ncity systems [2]. This is to be performed\
    \ keeping in view the UN Sustainable De-\nvelopment Goals 2030 [3]. In this regard,\
    \ Smart Cities have come out as a major\ninitiative by various governments in\
    \ making cities more navigable and welcoming to\nthe expected population increase\
    \ and providing city dwellers a better living experi-\nence, as is evidenced by\
    \ the multiple projects ongoing on both the public and private\nlevel [4, 5, 6,\
    \ 7]. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been the prime enabler of smart\ncities\
    \ as it has provided the means in terms of sensors, architectures, storage and\n\
    other technologies to instrument cities. It allows stakeholders to gather data,\
    \ pro-\ncess it and then make decisions based on the analyses performed. There\
    \ are various\ndomains within smart cities, these include Smart Agriculture, Smart\
    \ City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\
    \ Infrastructure and\nSmart Transportation.With improvement of Artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) capabilities\nin the last decade, there have been different applications\
    \ of machine learning (ML)\nand deep learning (DL) algorithms within each of these\
    \ domains providing for better\ndecision making and improvement of services. Apart\
    \ from various supervised and un-\nsupervised learning applications, several tasks\
    \ within different components of smart\ncities can be formulated into optimization\
    \ problems and/or require heuristics to be\nincorporated in some form. However,\
    \ in both such tasks, there is a dearth of an\noverall coverage of Smart City\
    \ IoT based ML/DL and combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Such a coverage would\
    \ be very beneficial to researchers starting in the\nfield and has been presented\
    \ herein.\nOne of the major applications of the IoT Smart Cities is for health\
    \ purposes.\nMany countries around the world, especially in the developed world\
    \ are facing an\naging population. With the retirement of the ’baby boomer’ generation,\
    \ countries\naround the world are facing a big question over caring for their\
    \ elderly population.\nOne of the major issues that elderly people face today\
    \ are falls [8]. In the US, falls\naccount for a majority of the deaths caused\
    \ by injury in population aged 65 and\nabove [9] and a fall related injury occurs\
    \ every 19 minutes [10]. As indicated in [11],\nfalls have been associated with\
    \ estimated medical costs ranging from $31.5 billion for\n2013 to $49.5 billion\
    \ for 2017. Moreover, Floerence et al. [12] notes that in 2018,\nfalls contributed\
    \ to 8% of Medicaid expenses in the US for older adults, consequently\n1\nfalls\
    \ have huge health as well as financial ramifications for people and governments.\n\
    Determining when a person has experienced a fall is therefore an important task\
    \ in\nthe healthcare of people, more so in the old age population who tend to\
    \ increasingly\nlive alone and are at increased risk of suffering from falls.\
    \ Apart from just detecting\nif a fall has occurred or not, the direction of a\
    \ fall is an important consideration\nas well. Bourke et al. [13] notes that even\
    \ though 60% of falls occurring in older\nadults are forward falls, falls occurring\
    \ sideways may result in fracture and thus\nare important to determine. Quick\
    \ dispatch of healthcare providers can result in\ntimely treatment of fall related\
    \ injuries, thereby reducing the overall impact to life\nand wealth. Additional\
    \ information about the fall could benefit the medical dispatch\nteam to help\
    \ decide emergency procedures which could be matched up with patient\nhistory\
    \ of potentially being injury prone in a certain part of the body. In light of\
    \ this\nall, the development of fall detection systems has been of keen interest\
    \ to researchers\nin the domain of human activity recognition, tele-medicine and\
    \ smart health.\n2\nAims\nCiting the importance of IoT usage in communities, the\
    \ aims of this dissertation are\nas follows:\n1. To provide a wholistic coverage\
    \ of IoT based Smart City system design consid-\nering important aspects such\
    \ as sensors, technologies used, IoT architectures,\nthe use of machine/deep learning\
    \ methods and optimization schemes as well as\nthe challenges.\n2. Considering\
    \ the case study of smart health and specifically fall detection, de-\nvelop methodologies\
    \ for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\n3\nOrganization\n\
    This dissertation is organized in to six chapters.\nChapter II presents a coverage\n\
    of the IoT for Smart Cities in terms of the technologies used, its architectures\
    \ and\nalso the challenges towards IoT usage in Smart Cities. Chapter III discusses\
    \ the the\napplications of machine and deep learning algorithms. This chapter\
    \ provides a com-\nprehensive discussion on IoT usage in Smart Cities by considering\
    \ the different types\nof systems devised for each application as well. Chapter\
    \ IV discusses the applications\nof optimization algorithms in IoT based smart\
    \ cities for five popular algorithms. It\nthus provides a coverage of optimization\
    \ applications under the IoT smart city um-\nbrella. Chapter V presents work on\
    \ a chosen case study of smart health based on\nIoT. The considered task is fall\
    \ detection with direction and severity consideration.\nFour experiments have\
    \ been performed in this regard considering three scenarios, one\nconsidering\
    \ falls only with direction and severity and two others considering falls and\n\
    activity of daily living (ADL) as a combined problem. The designed methodologies\n\
    have shown to outperform the state of the art as has been discussed in the chapter.\n\
    The conclusion and future work opportunities are discussed in chapter VI.\n2\n\
    CHAPTER II\nIOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides an overeview\
    \ of the use of IoT in Smart Cities and discuss\nhow it facilitates such initiatives.\
    \ It starts by laying out the structure of Internet\nof Things in a Smart City\
    \ context, discussing its various applications, components\nand architectures\
    \ while also discussing the technologies used at the different levels of\nthe\
    \ IoT architecture. Lastly, a discussion of the technical challenges that exist\
    \ in the\ndeployment of IoT in the Smart City domain is provided along with identification\
    \ of\npotential solutions to those challenges followed by future directions.\n\
    It is hard to define a Smart City, in fact, cities claim to be ‘smart’ based on\
    \ a\nvariety of criteria, for e.g. implementing novel e-governance schemes, creating\
    \ so-\ncial learning ventures and community engagement programs, focusing on sustainable\n\
    living as well as the more typical application of Information and Communication\n\
    Technologies for innovation [14]. In this work, Smart Cities are defined to be\
    \ the ap-\nplication of various information and communication technologies (ICT)\
    \ with the aim\nof creating a better living experience for a city’s population.\
    \ This encompasses use\nof these technologies in all the domains discussed previously,\
    \ including governance,\ntransport, housing, business, sustainable living, social\
    \ learning, community engage-\nment, providing opportunities and more. In an ideal\
    \ sense, the idea of a smart city\ntranscends the typically set boundaries of\
    \ a traditional city’s administrative and so-\ncial structure by allowing interaction\
    \ between the two, thereby enabling it to operate\nin a more cohesive and engaged\
    \ manner. Smart cities offer several advantages (in\nterms of value) compared\
    \ to a traditional city ecosystem:\n1. Climate goal achievement: Smart cities\
    \ are at the forefront of pioneering tech-\nnologies to help enable countries\
    \ meet climate goals. Smart city focuses on\nsmart energy management, smart transportation\
    \ systems and city administra-\ntion which aim to reduce the carbon footprint\
    \ of cities and enable development\nand use of new technologies for cleaner living.\n\
    2. Money value: Smart City ventures will be a market of USD 1 Trillion by 2025\n\
    [15], this provides a huge monetary incentive for not only governments but\nprivate\
    \ companies to actively contribute to the development of technologies\nsupporting\
    \ smart city development.\n3. Societal impact: The centerpiece of the smart city\
    \ project is to improve the qual-\nity of life of a city’s inhabitants and help\
    \ develop an inclusive society wherein\nevery opinion is catered for and equal\
    \ opportunity is provided. Information and\n3\nCommunication Technologies in the\
    \ smart city context are a fundamental com-\nponent to the provision of public\
    \ services by facilitating interactions of citizens\nwith the city environment\
    \ and making life easier.\n2\nSmart City Components\nA smart city is made up of\
    \ several components which are illustrated in Figure 1.\nSmart city applications\
    \ typically have four aspects associated with them, the first is\nthe collection\
    \ of data, the next is its transmission/reception, third is the storage and\n\
    fourth is analysis. The collection of data is application dependent and has been\
    \ a real\ndriver for sensor development in the various domains. The second part\
    \ is the exchange\nof data, this involves data transmission from the data collection\
    \ units towards the\ncloud for storage and analysis.\nThis task has been achieved\
    \ in several manners,\nmany smart city ventures have city-wide Wi-Fi networks,\
    \ 4G and 5G technologies are\nbeing used, as well as various types of local networks\
    \ which can convey data either\non a local level or a global level. The third\
    \ stage is storage in the cloud, different\nstorage schemes are used to arrange\
    \ and organize data so as to make it usable for\nthe fourth stage which is data\
    \ analysis. Data Analysis refers to the extraction of\npatterns and inferences\
    \ from the gathered data to guide decision making. In some\nsituations, simple\
    \ analysis such as basic decision making and aggregating would work\ntoo. For\
    \ more complex decision making, the availability of the cloud allows not only\n\
    for heterogeneous data gathering/storage and processing but also analysis through\n\
    the use of statistical methods as well as machine and deep Learning algorithms\
    \ in\nreal-time [16].\n2.1\nSmart Agriculture\nFood security is one of the most\
    \ important parts of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment goals for 2030.\
    \ With an increasing world population, worsening climate\nchange causing erratic\
    \ weather in food centers of the world, the race to ensure that\nfood production\
    \ is made sustainable and that dwindling resources such as water are\nutilized\
    \ efficiently has been a high priority for countries around the world. Smart\n\
    agriculture is the use of sensors embedded into plants and fields to measure various\n\
    parameters to help in decision making and prevent/diseases, pests etc [17]. A\
    \ part\nof the smart agriculture paradigm is precision agriculture, which involves\
    \ sensors\nbeing placed in plants to provide targeted measurements and therefore\
    \ allow for\ntargeted care mechanisms to be deployed. Precision agriculture will\
    \ be necessary\nfor food security in the future [18] and therefore is an essential\
    \ part of the fight for\nsustainable food production. The major applications of\
    \ AI in IoT for agriculture are\ncrop monitoring/disease detection and data driven\
    \ crop care and decision making.\n2.2\nSmart City Services\nSmart city services\
    \ encompass the activities that sustain a city’s population, these\ninvolve municipal\
    \ tasks such as supply of water, waste management, environmental\n4\nSmart \n\
    Energy\nSmart \nTransportation\nSmart \nAgriculture\nSmart \nInfrastructure\n\
    Smart  \nCity Services\nSmart Health\nSmart Homes\nSmart  Industry\nFigure 1.\
    \ Smart City Components\ncontrol and monitoring etc. Sensors for water quality\
    \ can be deployed to continually\nprovide an update about the quality of water\
    \ being used in the city and detect leaks\n[19]. One popular component of smart\
    \ city initiatives is the management of waste,\nand it has been the part of many\
    \ of the smart city initiatives mentioned earlier, from\nchutes in Barcelona to\
    \ having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud\nso as to not only\
    \ inform the relevant authorities of the need to empty them but also\nusing AI\
    \ to determine the best route to reduce cost [20]. Sensors can also be used to\n\
    monitor the environmental conditions in a city to determine pollution levels [21]\
    \ and\nguiding citizens to the next free parking space to save fuel costs [22].\n\
    2.3\nSmart Energy\nTypical electrical systems have one-way energy flow from a\
    \ main generator source,\nusually a hydroelectric or fossil fuel based power plant.\
    \ Power generation is controlled\nvia feedback from the substations, however,\
    \ since there is no information feedback\nfrom the consumer end, the power generation\
    \ scheme used with these systems requires\nthat the power being produced by these\
    \ sources outstrips the demand by a large\namount to ensure continuous supply\
    \ of power. The process of detecting faults and\nperforming corrective actions\
    \ in such systems is also a time taking process. Moreover,\nwith renewable energy\
    \ technologies becoming cheaper, the consumer of today not\nonly has a supply\
    \ from the main utility but also performs their own generation.\nSmart Grids is\
    \ the use of ICT to make the current and newly installed grids more\nobservable,\
    \ allow for distributed energy generation, both at the consumer end as well\n\
    as the utility end and introduce self-healing capabilities in to the grid. One\
    \ aspect\n5\nof smart grids is that real time power data is transmitted to utilities\
    \ at different\npoints on the grid throughout the supply lines till the customer.\
    \ Since smart grids\nprovide real-time data about consumer usage, it allows for\
    \ better management of\npower generation using prediction models developed through\
    \ acquired consumption\ndata, integrating different energy sources as well as\
    \ self-healing [23] of the network\nto ensure an uninterrupted supply.\n2.4\n\
    Smart Health\nSmart Health refers to the use of ICT to improve health care availability\
    \ and quality.\nWith an increasing population and rising costs of healthcare,\
    \ this area has been of\nintense focus of researchers as well as healthcare providers.\
    \ Current health systems\nare over burdened and therefore cannot cater to the\
    \ increasing demand from the pop-\nulace. In this regard, smart health aims to\
    \ ensure that healthcare be available to as\nmany people as possible through telemedicine\
    \ services [24] and improved diagnosis\nassistance to doctors utilizing AI [25].\
    \ With the ubiquitousness of mobile phones\nand health trackers [26] that can\
    \ capture real-time data about peoples health (ECGs,\ntemperature, body oxygen\
    \ saturation and other biosensors) while also recording daily\nactivity and detecting\
    \ abnormal movements using inertial sensors, it has become pos-\nsible to leverage\
    \ cloud capabilities for processing this data to make better healthcare\ndecisions.\
    \ Thus reducing the overall costs as well as burden on healthcare facilities.\n\
    2.5\nSmart Home\nOne major component of Smart Cities is the Smart Home since it\
    \ is central to the\nlife of the city’s inhabitants. Smart Homes involve the use\
    \ of sensing units installed\nthroughout a person’s home that provide information\
    \ about the home as well as\nits occupants. These sensors might include user activity\
    \ monitors such as ambient\nsensors, motion trackers and power/energy consumption.\n\
    2.6\nSmart Industry\nIndustries around the world are busy in a continuous pursuance\
    \ of being more ef-\nficient and increasing productivity while reducing cost.\
    \ The industry 4.0 paradigm\nentails the vision of a connected factory where all\
    \ its intermediary functionaries are\nseamlessly integrated, working in tandem\
    \ with each other. This is made possible be-\ncause of the internet of things\
    \ [27]. The use of IoT in manufacturing and production\nprocesses, cyber physical\
    \ systems integrating workers and machines has led to several\nbenefits to the\
    \ industry such as faster and better innovation, optimization of manu-\nfacturing\
    \ schemes (resources and processes), better quality of products and enhanced\n\
    safety for factory workers. However, smart industries come with several challenges\n\
    for IoT usage, working with a set of heterogeneous devices and machines has its\
    \ own\nchallenges and requires cyber physical systems to have flexibility in configuration,\
    \ con-\nnectivity and quick implementation for use in IoT applications for Smart\
    \ Industry\n[28]. Artificial Intelligence has gone hand in hand with IoT to spur\
    \ the development\nand deployment of industry 4.0 services. With sensors being\
    \ embedded in machines\n6\nand other processes in the factory, data from these\
    \ sources provide an opportunity for\nusing AI techniques to increase automation,\
    \ perform business intelligence operations\nand more. In fact, researchers have\
    \ suggested frameworks for integrating AI within\nIoT for Smart Industry [28,\
    \ 29, 30]. The major applications of AI in the industry are\npredictive maintenance,\
    \ monitoring/fault detection (machine health) and production\nmanagement.\n2.7\n\
    Smart Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure of a city is paramount to its living\
    \ quality, city governments need\nto construct new bridges, roads and buildings\
    \ for the use of its inhabitants and also\nperform maintenance for uninterrupted\
    \ usage. Smart infrastructure helps cities in\nensuring their infrastructure is\
    \ in shape and usable by utilizing sensors for measuring\nbuilding/bridge structural\
    \ state for structural health monitoring using accelerome-\nters [31] and smart\
    \ materials [32]. Data collected through these sensors allows for\npredictive\
    \ maintenance of these essential units to maintain normal operation of the\ncity.\n\
    2.8\nSmart Transport\nMany urban centers suffer from traffic problems, this includes\
    \ congestion, pollution,\nscheduling and cost reduction issues for public transport.\
    \ The rapid development\nand implementation of new Information and Communication\
    \ Technologies, Vehicle-\nInfrastructure-Pedestrian communication has become commonplace.\
    \ Whether it be\nVehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle\
    \ to Pedestrian (V2P)\nor Pedestrian to Infrastructure (P2I), such technologies\
    \ have made the design of smart\ntransportation systems possible. With cars having\
    \ a GPS device and the common-\nality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\
    \ use GPS data to track driver\nbehavior and traffic patterns [33]. This real-time\
    \ data is already used for route map-\nping in applications such as Waze and Google\
    \ Maps and used for trip scheduling in\npublic transport. Parking systems equipped\
    \ with sensors can also guide drivers to\nthe nearest free parking spot.\n3\n\
    Internet of Things for Smart Cities\nAt the heart of the smart city initiatives\
    \ is the internet of things, it is the enabling\ntechnology that has allowed for\
    \ the pervasive digitization that gives rise to the con-\ncept of smart cities.\
    \ The internet of things refers to the ubiquitous connection of\ndevices to the\
    \ internet, allowing them to send information to the cloud and poten-\ntially\
    \ get directions for performing actions. IoT involves the collection of data and\n\
    performing data analytics operations to extract information in order to support\
    \ de-\ncision and policy making. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 billion\
    \ devices\nwill be connected to the internet [34], spearheading even more application\
    \ develop-\nment. Within the smart city context, IoT allows for sensors to collect\
    \ and send data\n7\nabout the city’s state to a central cloud, which is then mined\
    \ or processed for pattern\nextraction and decision-making purposes.\n3.1\nIoT\
    \ Architectures for Smart cities\nThe Internet of Things unifies the operations\
    \ of data sensing, transmission/recep-\ntion, processing and storage through the\
    \ use cloud services. Based on technology, a\ngeneric IoT architecture consists\
    \ of five layers where successive layers operate on the\ninformation from the\
    \ previous layer as shown in Figure 2. It also shows the three\ndifferent architectures\
    \ that exist for IoT systems.\nCloud Computing\nEdge computing\nFog Computing\n\
    Business layer\nActuators\nMobile Elements\nSensors\nNetwork Technologies\nNetwork\

    \ Learning, Optimization, Deep Learning)\nApplications \nLayer\nMiddleware \n\
    Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSensing Layer\nFigure 2. IoT Architecture\nThe Sensing layer,\
    \ also called the Perception layer consists of sensors that can\nget information\
    \ about physical quantities of interest in any application as well as\nactuators\
    \ which can act upon physical objects, such as Radio Frequency IDentification\n\
    (RFID) readers for reading RFID tags and other such devices. The data read by\
    \ the\nsensing layer is passed onward to the Middleware layer using the networking\
    \ layer\nthrough wireless network technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular internet,\
    \ Zigbee and\nBluetooth etc.\nThe Middleware layer provides a generic interface\
    \ for the sensing\nlayer hardware and the Application layer which uses the data\
    \ through various API’s\nand database management services to provide users with\
    \ services. The Business layer\nis attached to the application layer and is used\
    \ to develop strategies and formulate\npolicies that help manage the complete\
    \ system.\nIn terms of architectures, typically, IoT architectures are categorized\
    \ based on\nthe type of operation responsibilities allocated to parts of the IoT\
    \ system, this cat-\negorization is based mainly on processing of data responsibilities.\
    \ There are three\narchitectures of IoT systems with respect to the stage of the\
    \ IoT framework where\nprocessing of data can be carried out and these are Cloud,\
    \ Fog and Edge Models.\nTable 1 lists the traits of each of three layers of the\
    \ IoT system. It is important to\n8\nmention that the three IoT architectures\
    \ discussed here are not mutually exclusive,\ninstead the aim of this hierarchy\
    \ is to complement the higher layer by providing it only\nuseful information which\
    \ makes the system more productive and dependable. For any\nIoT system designer,\
    \ the aim is to establish a balance between the capabilities of the\nthree layers\
    \ keeping in view system costs and requirements.\n3.1.1\nCloud Computing Model\n\
    This was the first proposed architecture for IoT systems and is based on the premise\n\
    that processing of data from the various components in the IoT system should take\n\
    place in the cloud. Cloud computing allows for the remote accessing of uninterrupted\n\
    shared resources (computing, storage and services) over the network. It should\
    \ be\nable to dynamically allocate these resources without human intervention,\
    \ schedule\nor pool as necessary and be able to be accessed from a variety of\
    \ different platforms\n[35]. The cloud can provide both hardware as well as software\
    \ services for smart city\napplications. It has the advantage that it provides\
    \ a central management platform\nfrom which to observe, control the IoT system\
    \ as well as to disseminate command\nactions based on the received data. Moreover,\
    \ this centralization also allows for cloud\nsystems to have sufficiently large\
    \ computing and storage capacities thereby allowing\nthem to perform complex tasks\
    \ of data mining, pattern extraction and making infer-\nences from sensor data\
    \ in smart cities to make use of it in the best manner possible.\nHowever, there\
    \ are a few disadvantages with using the cloud computing model for\nthe IoT. First,\
    \ transmitting all gathered data to the cloud increases network traffic,\neven\
    \ though this may not be true for applications in which measurements are not\n\
    very frequent, but in other cases, this could increase network costs. Moreover,\
    \ data\ntransmission overheads may increase due to the large amount of data that\
    \ needs to\nbe transmitted by the many sensors existing in the smart city scenario.\
    \ Another\ndisadvantage that the cloud computing model suffers from is data latency,\
    \ since the\nsensing units exist at the sensing layer and the decision making/data\
    \ processing takes\nplace in the cloud, this gives rise to data latency in the\
    \ transmission of sensing infor-\nmation, especially when many devices start sending\
    \ data at the same time. Network\nreliability can be an issue when using this\
    \ model, with the large volume of data traffic\non the network, it might not be\
    \ possible to enforce robust data transmission schemes\nas IoT systems get bigger.\n\
    3.1.2\nFog Computing Model\nSince most of the information produced with in IoT\
    \ takes place towards the sensing\nend of the IoT system, also called the edge,\
    \ Fog Computing was proposed in [36]\nto overcome some of the problems of the\
    \ cloud computing model for the IoT. Fog\ncomputing provides a more diverse distribution\
    \ of responsibilities than are dictated\nby the cloud computing architecture by\
    \ moving some of the processing to devices\non the local network.\nTypically,\
    \ Fog computing refers to data processing that is\ncarried out by routers and\
    \ other network devices within in the Network layer in the\nIoT. Since network\
    \ devices nowadays increasingly offer better computational capabil-\n9\nities,\
    \ one can leverage them to perform rudimentary operations on data. Operations\n\
    such as aggregation and collection of sensor data, simple processing operations\
    \ and\ndecision-making can be performed to reduce the amount of information flow\
    \ towards\nthe higher cloud layer. Questions that need to be answered for the\
    \ decision-making\nprocess include but are not limited to for e.g., does the decision\
    \ require the use of\naveraging for one quantity and instantaneous values of the\
    \ other? Is it possible to\nextrapolate data received for one quantity and use\
    \ the currently measured value for\nanother one? Based on the previous data for\
    \ a given period, can one provide higher\nlayers with decision options rather\
    \ than just data, thereby providing better quality\ninformation to the cloud layer\
    \ thus resulting in better utilization of cloud resources.\nFog layers can localize\
    \ decision making since they have access to the local state of a\ngiven region\
    \ [37]. This would be helpful in implementing distributed decision mak-\ning mechanisms\
    \ which might be necessary in some applications. Moreover, they also\nallow for\
    \ local networks to be established using non-internet technologies such as Zig-\n\
    bee, Bluetooth, RFID etc where sensors and other end devices transmit data to\
    \ the\nFog node (also referred to as access points in such systems) which is connected\
    \ to the\ncloud.\nFog computing results in reduced costs for deployment of IoT\
    \ systems, increases ro-\nbustness as latency, data overhead and errors in transmission\
    \ are reduced. This also\nimproves the efficiency of the applications as quicker\
    \ decisions can be made on the\nreceived data, which is important in critical\
    \ decision-making situations. Moreover,\nFog devices have the capability to not\
    \ only receive data from similar devices at the\nedge but also collect it from\
    \ many different types of devices. This capability to mea-\nsure different parameters\
    \ in the edge environment enable for an application neutral\nIoT system architecture\
    \ to be developed.\nData sent upward by the Fog layer in the IoT hierarchy would\
    \ be used to gain insights\nin to system behavior and to guide new rules of system\
    \ operation, this will typically\nbe carried out in the cloud. Devices in the\
    \ Fog layer may be provided decision making\nguidance from the higher cloud layer\
    \ to ensure smooth system operation. However,\na balance needs to be struck as\
    \ to the division of responsibilities between the cloud\nand the fog layer keeping\
    \ in view the costs involved.\n3.1.3\nEdge Computing Model\nThe purpose of Fog\
    \ Computing was to push some of the decision making towards\nthe edge of the network.\
    \ In recent years, with increasingly capable devices being\ndeveloped that are\
    \ attached to ‘edge’ nodes, simple decision making, and processing\nof data has\
    \ been increasingly moved on to these devices so as to reduce network\nand device\
    \ costs even further at the fog level and make for even deeper distributed\ndecision-making\
    \ schemes. Edge computing refers to data processing that is done at\nthe ”thing”\
    \ level, i.e. by sensors and other devices in the IoT system [38]. Another\nconcept\
    \ about Edge computing as discussed in [39] defines the Edge computing layer\n\
    as an intermediary layer between the Fog and the ‘things’ (sensors) rather than\
    \ edge\nnodes. The difference between them in this case is the Edge computing\
    \ nodes act\nas aggregation and decision-making units on a smaller scale compared\
    \ to fog devices\n10\nwhich act to provide seamless connectivity and data integrity\
    \ throughout the IoT\nnetwork. The aim of the Fog and the Edge computing paradigms\
    \ is to decentralize\nthe IoT system for purposes of reducing cost, increasing\
    \ scalability and increasing\nrobustness.\nTable 1. Comparison of Cloud, Fog and\

    \ Internet of Things promises the digitization of all aspects of our lives. For\
    \ smart\ncities, this digitization process entails the proliferation of sensing\
    \ nodes in every\ndomain of a city’s operation mechanism. With an application\
    \ scope this broad, the\ncreation and subsequent deployment of IoT systems in\
    \ smart cities carry enormous\nchallenges that need to be considered. In this\
    \ section, a discussion is provided of\nthe challenges that IoT system designers\
    \ face when making deployments in smart\ncity applications.\nThe focus in this\
    \ work is on the technological challenges that\npertain to IoT use in smart cities\
    \ and has also been the focus of researchers. Figure 3\nshows the different challenges\
    \ which Smart City IoT system deployment encounters,\nnamely Security and Privacy,\
    \ Smart Sensors, Networking and Big Data Analytics. A\nsummary of the discussion\
    \ in this section is presented in Table 2.\n11\nSmart City\nChallenges\nSmart\

    3.2.1\nSecurity and Privacy\nSecurity, along with Privacy is the primary concern\
    \ in smart cities.\nSmart cities\ninvolve having essential city infrastructures\
    \ online, any aberration in the operation\nof the city’s services will bring inconvenience\
    \ to its citizens and put human lives and\nproperty at risk. Therefore, security\
    \ is a big concern in smart cities. In today’s age\nwhere cybercrime and warfare\
    \ have become a tactic in world politics, smart cities\nare at an ever-greater\
    \ risk of being the target of such malicious attacks. Encryption\nof data transmitted\
    \ over the network is necessary in this scenario. For smart city\nprojects to\
    \ be successful, they require the trust and participation of citizens. The\nproliferation\
    \ of sensors in smart cities, which continuously collect data about the\nactivity\
    \ of people may expose the daily activities of citizens to unwanted parties.\n\
    Moreover, companies and corporations on the IoT network may use citizen data\n\
    without their approval for things like targeted advertising and may perform acts\
    \ such\nas eavesdropping etc. Solutions to this will require processes that anonymize\
    \ data\ncollection while retaining the integrity of the context of the measured\
    \ task so that\napt decision making is possible. Security and Privacy has been\
    \ covered in detail in a\nlater section.\n12\n3.2.2\nSmart Sensors\nSmart sensors\
    \ are the hardware components that gather data in smart cities. These\ndevices\
    \ are manufactured by a host of different vendors that adhere to different sens-\n\
    ing mechanisms, standards of measurement, data formats and connectivity proto-\n\
    cols. Smart city deployment will require all these devices to exchange data, perform\n\
    scheduling of tasks between them and be able to aggregate data together for mak-\n\
    ing inferences. A solution to this issue is to develop and use open protocols\
    \ and\ndata formats that will enable manufacturers to create equipment that can\
    \ communi-\ncate between each other, further spurring IoT system deployment. Another\
    \ solution\ncould be the development of ‘standard’ access point nodes for IoT\
    \ systems that can\ncommunicate to devices using several different communication\
    \ protocols and are able\nto decode the information received. Some manufacturers\
    \ have, in fact, made their\nproducts compatible with other protocols as mentioned\
    \ in [40].\nAnother challenge for smart sensors is reliability and robustness.\
    \ Reliability and\nrobustness refer to the dependability and correctness of the\
    \ IoT system. IoT is the\nbackbone of future smart cities and being imperative\
    \ to their operation, the IoT\nsystem needs to provide a smooth experience to\
    \ its users. This requires that service\nrequests from users of the application\
    \ receive an accurate and timely response. The\nquality of service needs to be\
    \ ensured for every citizen in the smart city. Systems\nthat deliver critical\
    \ utilities such as transport, electricity etc. should be decentralized.\nThe\
    \ distributed connection points will allow for robustness and increase reliability.\n\
    One such example is self-healing in Smart Grids [23].\nMany current networking\
    \ protocols are developed for infrastructure networked\ndevices which have access\
    \ to continuous power, however, sensors in smart cities will\nbe mobile in many\
    \ scenarios and thus be battery powered. Moreover, they will need\nto measure,\
    \ transfer and in some cases save data they have collected. This requires\nthe\
    \ development of not only low power, low overhead data transmission schemes\n\
    but also development of new memory and storage technologies as well as low power\n\
    devices that extend battery life as much as possible. Storing this large amount\
    \ of\ndata would require development of compression algorithms which will be employed\n\
    and database schemes that will need to be developed in the future as smart cities\n\
    and IoT are scaled up. Solutions for power issues necessitate the development\
    \ of new\nbattery technologies and perhaps the incorporation of energy harvesting\
    \ mechanisms\nin such devices to make long lasting service provision possible.\n\
    3.2.3\nNetworking\nThe IoT depends on the capability of sensing and other devices\
    \ to be able to send\nand receive information to each other and the Cloud. With\
    \ new smart city appli-\ncations coming up, providing networking to these devices\
    \ to remain connected is a\nbig challenge. Current networking methods are not\
    \ optimized to providing network-\ning services for smart city components. Many\
    \ devices in smart cities have mobility\nand data throughput requirements which\
    \ need to be met to provide an acceptable\nquality of service. Different approaches\
    \ have been suggested in terms of defining ac-\n13\ncess points, local networks\
    \ etc. to solve this problem. Another aspect of networking\nwould be working on\
    \ efficient and dynamic routing protocols that can serve IoT re-\nquirements capable\
    \ of working with stationary as well as devices in motion, which\nmany current\
    \ protocols do not offer sufficiently [41].\n3.2.4\nBig Data Analytics\nIoT connected\
    \ devices generated 13.6 Zetta Bytes of data in 2018 and this is expected\nto\
    \ grow to 79.4 Zetta Bytes till 2025 [34]. To make use of this data and continuously\n\
    improve the services that are delivered in smart cities, new data analytics algorithms\n\
    need to be developed. With the myriad of the different parameters that are measured\n\
    in smart cities, these algorithms need to be applicable to data of varying nature\
    \ (both\nstructured and unstructured), better data fusion techniques need to be\
    \ developed as\nwell so as to combine them in meaningful ways and be able to extract\
    \ inferences and\nrecognize patterns. Deep learning has been of interest in this\
    \ area as it can lever-\nage on this large amount of data to provide better results\
    \ for different applications.\nAnother important consideration would be to ensure\
    \ that the developed algorithms\nare scalable in that they have enough generality\
    \ and can be used through out the\nintended application. For, e.g., for the purposes\
    \ of activity recognition, the authors\nin [42] found that a CNN trained for activity\
    \ recognition on one dataset failed to\nperform well on others or in [43] where\
    \ the deep learning network performs poorly\nwhen the color of tomatoes is different\
    \ from what it was trained on. Concept drift is\nanother issue of concern as with\
    \ the continuous acquisition of data, the properties of\ndata may change over\
    \ time. Techniques such as incremental learning may be useful\nin this respect.\
    \ Explainability is another important factor for Smart City analytics\nto be widely\
    \ acceptable, specially in the area of smart health. There have been some\napproaches\
    \ suggested towards this end, in [44] a hybrid deep learning classifier and\n\
    semantic web technologies based solution is demonstrated for the application of\
    \ flood\nmonitoring. In [45], the authors present an explainable deep learning\
    \ based health-\ncare system at the Edge for COVID-19 care based on a distributed\
    \ learning paradigm\nwith promising results. However, more work needs to be performed\
    \ to incorporate\nexplainability techniques such as distillation, visualization,\
    \ and intrinsic methods into\nMachine and Deep Learning based smart city applications\
    \ in order to increase smart\ncity application proliferation.\n3.3\nSensing Technologies\n\
    Sensing is at the heart of smart city technologies. Sensors provide the knowledge\
    \ and\ndata from which smart city innovations are created. With the vastly different\
    \ nature\nof Smart City projects and its various components, there are numerous\
    \ sensors which\nare used as part of these initiatives. The authors in [58] have\
    \ provided a framework\nfor the comparison of IoT sensors and have listed sensors\
    \ they found in use for the\nInternet of Things. We use their work to direct our\
    \ survey of the sensing technologies\nused in smart cities. Sensors within IoT\
    \ can be divided in to several groups, these are\nambient, motion, electric, biosensors,\
    \ identification, presence, hydraulic and chemical\n14\nTable 2. Smart City IoT\

    \ are the key component in smart city IoT\nsystems which provide the interaction\
    \ between the smart city system and the city’s\ninhabitants and allow for new\
    \ services to be developed. One thing to note is that\nmany of the sensors find\
    \ applications in multiple areas as discussed. Furthermore,\nany given application\
    \ will require measuring different physical quantities and will\nrequire the use\
    \ of many different types of sensors. For, e.g., ambient, motion, electric,\n\
    identification, position, chemical and hydraulic sensors have been found to be\
    \ used in\nsmart homes. As noted in the challenges, working with different sensors\
    \ which might\nhave different output data types is a task that needs to be dealt\
    \ with when working\nwith multiple types of sensors. Table 3 presents a summary\
    \ of the sensors used in\neach smart city component.\n3.3.1\nAmbient Sensors\n\
    Ambient sensors include sensors used to measure physical quantities indicating\
    \ to\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity\
    \ and pressure.\nAmbient sensors are used in a variety of smart city applications\
    \ including smart homes\nwhere they are used to regulate the comfort level, they\
    \ are also used for smart city\nservices.\n3.3.2\nBio-Sensors\nBio-sensors are\
    \ used for measuring health parameters of living things. Bio-sensors in\nsmart\
    \ cities are used for monitoring patients for healthcare purposes. Such sensors\

    and more.\n3.3.3\nChemical\nChemical sensors are used to measure chemical properties\
    \ of materials, this includes\ngas sensors which can measure/detect carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2)\nand other gases for air quality monitoring, sensors\
    \ for detecting smoke, pH and other\nsensors for water quality monitoring etc.\n\
    3.3.4\nElectric Sensors\nElectric sensors allow for the measurement of electrical\
    \ power and are widely used in\nsmart grids and smart homes to monitor the power\
    \ consumption of consumers/ap-\npliances. Types include current transformers and\
    \ voltage sensors to measure current\nand voltage, respectively.\n3.3.5\nHydraulic\n\
    Hydraulic sensors refer to sensors used for liquid measurements such as level,\
    \ flow,\nleak detection. These are used for measurement of liquid levels in tanks\
    \ [59].\n16\n3.3.6\nIdentification\nIdentification sensors refer to RFID tags\
    \ and Near Field Communication (NFC) de-\nvices. These sensors are used in applications\
    \ involving payments, data exchange in\nthe domain of smart transportation and\
    \ smart city services.\n3.3.7\nMotion Sensors\nMotion sensors refer to sensors\
    \ that can be used for the detection of motion. Sensors\nfor motion sensing involve\
    \ inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese sensors are used\
    \ in smart health applications such as activity tracking as well\nas applications\
    \ like vibration sensing in smart homes and industry.\n3.3.8\nPresence\nPresence\
    \ sensors indicate to the presence of a humans or objects. Passive InfraRed\n\
    (PIR) sensors are very popular and are used to detect human motion, reed switches\n\
    can be used on windows and doors for security purposes, inductive loop sensors\
    \ which\nuse electromagnetic induction can be used to detect presence in transport\
    \ systems.\nUltrasonic sensors are also used to determine the distance of objects.\n\
    Capacitive\nsensors are also included in this type, these may be used to determine\
    \ position.\n3.3.9\nOther Sensors\nVarious smart city applications make use of\
    \ different sensing modalities such as audio\nor visual information or other signal\
    \ measurement devices, for, e.g., bluetooth and\nWi-Fi signal strength. Since\
    \ the sensors for these modalities capture raw information\nabout signals (visual,\
    \ sound or signal strength etc.), the gathered data is typically\nprocessed further\
    \ before it indicates to the target variable being measured.\n3.4\nNetworking\
    \ Technologies\nThe internet of things in smart cities depends on the aggregation\
    \ of data measured by\nindividual sensing units placed throughout the smart city\
    \ environment. Systems that\ncan use these measurements individually have long\
    \ existed and provided automation\nfor small projects. However, the ‘smart’ in\
    \ smart city comes from the collective usage\nof the data from these individual\
    \ sensing units to perform complex decisions while\ndelivering services to citizens.\
    \ The collective use of this data enables its analysis over\na wider scope compared\
    \ to individual levels so as to determine long term patterns\nand provide meaningful\
    \ insights to support services. The number of such IoT devices\ncurrently present\
    \ in the world [34] are multiple times that of the world population.\nTo enable\
    \ these devices to exchange data, wireless technologies need to be used as\nphysical\
    \ connections would, for one, be too costly (where ever they can be used),\nsecond,\
    \ would not satisfy the mobility requirements that are typical of many smart\n\
    city applications. The internet has provided connectivity to computers, smartphones\n\
    and other electronic devices around the world with each other, allowing for instant\n\

    transfer of information between them. However, for IoT the internet may not neces-\n\
    sarily be the only communication method [72] as many applications do not possess\n\
    edge devices that can connect to the internet. An application may consist of a\
    \ local\nnetwork of sensing units which can exchange data between them and rely\
    \ on a multi-\nhop communication protocol to send data to a central node, hub\
    \ or gateway. The\ngateway might be fixed and would be connected to the internet,\
    \ thereby relaying any\nmonitored data to the cloud for further processing or\
    \ use. It might also be possible\nthat devices within an application may use many\
    \ different protocols with the central\nnode having the capability to communicate\
    \ with all of them, a common case for such\narchitectures is the smart home where\
    \ manufacturers produce devices using propriety\nor incompatible protocols for\
    \ which a hub may be used, an example of such a system\nwas provided in [73] and\
    \ several hubs are commercially available. In this section, we\ndiscuss the network\
    \ types, topologies and protocols used in the Internet of Things for\nSmart City\
    \ applications as illustrated in Figure 5. We later provide a comparison of\n\
    these protocols in Table 4.\n3.4.1\nNetwork Topologies\nThere are three IoT network\
    \ topologies, point to point, star and mesh [74]. The first\ntype of topology\
    \ is the point to point topology where devices are connected to each\nother sequentially\
    \ in a point to point manner. Point to point networks introduce\ndata hops for\
    \ packets that need to be sent to other nodes as data needs to go through\neach\
    \ node in the path of the two nodes wanting to exchange data. Point to point\n\
    networks are not very popular in IoT systems as it ranks low on fault resiliency\
    \ and\nwill breakdown if there is a fault in any of the intermediate nodes. In\
    \ Star topology,\n18\nall units in a network are connected to a central node or\
    \ gateway and cannot send data\nto each other directly. In order to perform an\
    \ exchange of data among themselves, the\ndevices need to send it through the\
    \ central node. Star topology networks, with their\ncentral node structure provide\
    \ a natural aggregation scheme for data collection within\nthe internet of things,\
    \ however, large networks consisting of many devices, which can\nbe the case in\
    \ most smart city applications, may result in high latency and possible\nbottlenecks\
    \ in high information throughput scenarios. Star topology has been used in\nvarious\
    \ applications including disaster management [75] and environmental sensing\n\
    [76]. The last type of network topology that is used in IoT is the Mesh network\n\
    topology, mesh networks allow all individual devices to communicate between them.\n\
    By enabling communication between the nodes in a network, mesh topology offers\n\
    a larger range as data transmitted towards a certain node can make multiple hops\n\
    through the network, this also increases the networks resilience as alternate\
    \ paths\ncould be used if packet delivery fails due to any node becoming faulty.\
    \ In fact, such\ntopologies have been used in smart homes [77] as well as in smart\
    \ grids [78]. There are\nother topologies which have not been mentioned, for,\
    \ e.g., tree (which has multiple\nstar networks connected in a point by point\
    \ fashion).\n3.4.2\nNetwork Architectures\nNetwork Architecture refers to the\
    \ structure of the network used for a given appli-\ncation. As discussed earlier,\
    \ the ‘things’ in IoT may not necessarily be connected\nthrough the internet,\
    \ in fact a distributed connectivity structure may be imple-\nmented with only\
    \ one unit in the network being capable of sending data to the\ncloud depending\
    \ on the requirement. Work in [72] mentions three types of network\narchitectures\
    \ that are used for smart cities based on IoT. These are Home Area\nNetworks (HANs),\
    \ Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Field/Neighborhood Area Net-\nworks (FANs/NANs).\
    \ Home Area Networks are short range networks and are usually\nused to transmit\
    \ information to a central node which is responsible for data collection\nbefore\
    \ it is sent to the cloud. Communication within the network is performed using\n\
    some low power communication protocol such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. HANs\n\
    are very popular in smart homes where they are used to gather power consumption\n\
    and times of operation data from a multitude of appliances which are then sent\
    \ to\na smart meter as part of a smart grid [79]. The second type of network architecture\n\
    is Field Area Networks (FANs), sometimes also called Neighborhood Area Networks\n\
    (NANs). Field Area Networks have a larger communication range than HANs and\n\
    are used to provide connection between a customer (for, e.g., in a smart grid)\
    \ to the\nutility company. Wide Area Networks are used for network structures\
    \ that require\ncommunication over large distances. These networks are not as\
    \ dense as HANs or\nFANs and utilize technologies such as cellular services, wired\
    \ connections such as fiber\noptics as well as a class of low power protocols\
    \ designed for WANs themselves [80].\nWANs are used in a variety of smart city\
    \ applications including Smart Grids where\nthey are used to connect multiple\
    \ substations together or exchanging data between\nthe customer and the substation\
    \ [81].\n19\n3.4.3\nNetwork Protocols\nThe type of network to use depends on the\
    \ requirements of the application. It is\nimperative that the communication protocol\
    \ used in a smart city application meet\nthe desirable quality of service (QoS).\
    \ Several protocols have been used in the internet\nof things for smart cities\
    \ [48, 82, 83, 84], herein, we discuss the traits of the most\npopular wireless\
    \ networking protocols used in smart cities.\n3.4.3.1\nRFID\nRadio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) utilizes radio frequencies\nto transmit and receive data. RFID communication\
    \ consists of two types of devices,\none device is the Reader and the other is\
    \ called the Tag. The Reader is usually\npowered and once a tag comes in the vicinity\
    \ of the reader, an exchange of information\ntakes place after authorization as\
    \ the tag harvests the energy from the reader. Such\ntags are called passive tags,\
    \ there are also active tags which are do not depend on the\nreader for their\
    \ power. Depending on the standard, RFID can operate on different\nfrequencies\
    \ in the radio frequency spectrum between 125 KHz to 928 MHz and can\nbe used\
    \ over short ranges. They are used in applications such as smart transport\n(toll\
    \ tax collection, parking), smart health and more.\n3.4.3.2\nNear Field Communication\n\
    Near Field Communication (NFC) is very\nsimilar to RFID, however, the structure\
    \ of NFC communication doesn’t consist of\ntags and readers. Unlike RFID, both\
    \ devices which want to communicate using NFC\nneed to be powered and data tranmission/reception\
    \ can take place in both directions\nunlike RFIDs. This enables the use of NFC\
    \ to control and configure devices unlike the\nRFID which cannot be used for measurement\
    \ or control tasks. NFC utilizes similar\nfrequencies to RFID but is used for\
    \ very short distances. NFC devices are popular\nfor applications involving payment\
    \ using smart phones and are also used in smart\nhomes.\n3.4.3.3\nBluetooth\n\
    Bluetooth is a low energy protocol popular in IoT applica-\ntions as it can support\
    \ an unlimited number of nodes [82]. The protocol is designed\nfor short range,\
    \ low bandwidth communication in an arrangement where devices can\neasily exit\
    \ or enter the network. Bluetooth natively supports the star topology as it\n\
    has a master device at the center of the communication mechanism. It operates\
    \ in\nthe 2.4 GHz ISM band and can have maximum data rates of 2 Mbps. Bluetooth\
    \ has\nbeen widely used in smart home due to it providing a direct connection\
    \ interface to\nsmart phones without the need for any intermediary hub device.\n\
    3.4.3.4\nZ-Wave\nZ-Wave or Zensys wave is a low power protocol developed to\n\
    be used in home automation applications. It is a low speed protocol with a short\n\
    range, operating in the frequencies of 868 MHz and 900 MHz. It operates in a master\n\
    slave fashion where a master can have multiple slave devices which can respond\
    \ to\ncommands from the master node. Therefore this is well suited for applications\
    \ where\na central control element is present and needs to gather data from multiple\
    \ sensing\nunits such as smart homes and smart healthcare systems.\n20\n3.4.3.5\n\
    Li-Fi\nLi-Fi (Light Fidelity) uses visible light instead of radio frequency\n\
    (RF) to exchange data. The advantage with using Li-Fi over RF communication is\n\
    that it can utilize already present lighting systems which also results in conservation\n\
    of power [85]. It offers very high speeds of data transfer for short distances\
    \ and has\nbeen used in parking systems.\n3.4.3.6\nWi-Fi\nWi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)\
    \ operates using wireless frequencies in the\n2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands to provide\
    \ high speed internet connectivity in a limited\ndistance. Wi-Fi is popular in\
    \ many smart city applications as it provides ready to\nuse interface to smart\
    \ phones, computers and other wearable gadgets.\n3.4.3.7\nZigbee\nThe ZigBee protocol\
    \ was developed as a low power low cost pro-\ntocol for wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) and has evolved to be used in the Internet\nof Things. The ZigBee protocol\
    \ operates in the 868 MHz/915 MHz/2.4 GHz band\nand offers moderate data transfer\
    \ speeds with distances similar to Wi-Fi in a multi-\nhop data transfer scheme.\
    \ Zigbee radios are low cost devices and therefore it is a\npopular protocol used\
    \ by many manufacturers of smart home, smart healthcare de-\nvices. A ZigBee network\
    \ will have three devices, one called the coordinator which\nis the controller\
    \ of the network, the router which is responsible for moving data to\nother devices\
    \ and the ZigBee end device (sensors and actuators).\n3.4.3.8\nWi-SUN\nThe Wireless\
    \ Smart Utility Network (Wi-SUN) is a network\napproved by Institute of Electrical\
    \ and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and is used in\nfield area networks for utility\
    \ metering, automation of distribution for utilities such\nas electricity, gas\
    \ etc. and also for demand response systems for utility-based appli-\ncations.\
    \ It supports IPv6 addressing and can be used in star or mesh configuration\n\
    where it also allows for multi-hop communication [86].\n3.4.3.9\nCellular\nCellular\
    \ technologies refers to 3G, 4G and 5G communications.\nAlong with Bluetooth and\
    \ Zigbee, they are the most popular IoT enabling technolo-\ngies. Cellular communication\
    \ provides high data rate and supports more content rich\napplications compared\
    \ to the other protocols. With the long range they provide, they\nare preferred\
    \ for a variety of applications where power is not an issue. Depending on\nthe\
    \ technology, cellular bands range from 600 MHz to 80 GHz with very high data\n\
    rates.\n3.4.3.10\nLoRaWAN\nLoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network (Lo-\n\
    RaWAN) and it is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that consists of several\n\
    gateways and multiple end devices with the gateways connected to a back-end net-\n\
    work server. The back-end server provides connection to the cloud. End devices\
    \ do\nnot have a fixed association with a specific gateway and may send data to\
    \ multiple\ngateways when it needs to transfer data to the cloud.\n21\n3.4.3.11\n\
    6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN which is short for IPv6 over Low Power Net-\nworks was created\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifically for\ninternet of\
    \ things applications with the aim of making it possible for providing in-\nternet\
    \ connectivity to small devices. It is an IP based network and leverages IPv6\n\
    communication. This is a short-range network operating in Industrial, Scientific\
    \ and\nMedical (ISM) bands.\n3.4.3.12\nSigFox\nSigFox is a proprietary standard\
    \ developed by SigFox Inc., France.\nIt uses unlicensed bands to perform ultra-narrowband\
    \ bidirectional communication\nwith low speeds [87]. SigFox has a similar architecture\
    \ to LoRaWAN and like Lo-\nRaWAN and 6LoWPAN, SigFox is a popular LPWAN in the\
    \ IoT domain offering\nsufficiently large distances of communication of up to\
    \ 50 km. SigFox finds applica-\ntions in security in buildings, smart lighting\
    \ and environmental monitoring.\n3.4.3.13\nNB-IoT\nNB-IoT (Narrow Band IoT) is\
    \ a type of LPWAN which oper-\nates on Global System for Mobile Communications\
    \ (GSM) and Long-Term Evolution\n(LTE) bands. In fact, it can operate using the\
    \ same hardware with a software up-\ngrade as it is considered a bare bones version\
    \ of LTE. It allows for connecting up to\n100,000 devices per cell.\nTable 4.\

    \ Smart Cities.\n3.5\nSecurity and Privacy in Smart City IoT\nSmart Cities involve\
    \ the transmission of sensing data, control information through\nthe internet\
    \ as well as local networks. Moreover, several components in smart cities\ntend\
    \ to critical aspects of a citys operation and are highly intertwined with the\
    \ social\nand private life of its citizens. Consequently, security and privacy\
    \ in Smart Cities\nis of great importance and has been of high interest to researchers\
    \ [51, 88, 89, 90,\n91, 92]. The topic of Security of IoT has been covered in\
    \ [93] who deliberate upon\nthe challenges faced in the different architectures\
    \ of the IoT and present issues and\nsolutions. We cover security for IoT in smart\
    \ cities so as to highlight issues that are\npertinent to in the Smart City context\
    \ and to complete our discussion on this topic.\nSmart Cities are enabled by collecting\
    \ data through sensors within a city as well\nas its populace, process it and\
    \ then mine it to provide a better quality of life to the\npeople living. These\
    \ sensors can provide an estimate about the internal state of a\ncity’s components\
    \ such as transportation, power system, building condition/state,\nhuman mobility\
    \ and more. All of this data is sent to the cloud where it is processed\nand mined.\
    \ However, there are several issues that pertain to how these data are\nsent and\
    \ used and raises questions about integrity, protection and the confidentiality\n\

    \ for Smart Cities.\nof this process. In fact, this concern is not unwarranted\
    \ for, in 2015 an attack on\nthe Ukranian power grid which left 225,000 people\
    \ without power [94] opened the\nworlds eyes to the very real threat posed by\
    \ cyber attackers. Data gathered in Smart\nCity applications can be used to perform\
    \ many undesired acts, GPS devices that are\npresent in every phone and most vehicles\
    \ are susceptible to providing information\nabout a persons location, habits as\
    \ well as lead to privacy issues as discussed in [91],\npower consumption and\
    \ ambient sensor data from a building may indicate to occu-\npancy [95] and even\
    \ indicate to the individual identities [96]. This information may\nbe used by\
    \ bad actors to carry out unlawful acts causing risk to life and property.\nTo\
    \ secure the Internet of Things for Smart Cities, typical security schemes might\
    \ not\nbe as effective in many cases and new methods will need to be developed\
    \ to cope\nwith the security and privacy issues in IoT for Smart Cities. In order\
    \ to provide a\nstandardized framework and terminology for discussing security\
    \ attacks, we adapt the\nstandard attack incident taxonomy [97] suggested by the\
    \ Computer Emergency Re-\nsponse Team (CERT) which was established by Defense\
    \ Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) for use towards IoT for Smart Cities.\
    \ This is shown in Figure 6.\nThere are different types of security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT in Smart Cities,\nthey exist on each of the three levels of the\
    \ IoT architecture, application software\nlayers, network layer and the perception\
    \ layer along with some system wide issues, a\ndiscussion is provided for each\
    \ of them. Furthermore, Table 5 provides a summary\nof the security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT for Smart Cities and the counter measures\nthat one can take to\
    \ mitigate them.\n3.5.1\nApplication Software Layers\nApplication software layers\
    \ are comprised of the Middleware, Application and Busi-\nness Layers. Security\
    \ and privacy in the application software layers tend to issues\nrelating to storage\
    \ of data and its usage. These are data visibility, access and injec-\ntion.\n\
    24\n3.5.1.1\nData Visibility/Identification\nOnce data is gathered, it is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud where it is stored and mined to make inferences. Since the cloud\
    \ would be used\nby multiple entities with different standards of security protocols\
    \ and practices, it is\nextremely important that data stored in the cloud is encrypted\
    \ so as not to allow its\nexposure to unwanted entities. Any data stored in plain\
    \ form would be a risk to not\nonly user privacy but also company rapport.\n3.5.1.2\n\
    Data access/Secondary Use\nAccess control is also a major issue in\nsmart city\
    \ data. Most Smart City applications rely on the usage of data from different\n\
    applications to provide smart services, thus resulting in the gathered data to\
    \ be used\nby many different enterprises. To allow this to take place smoothly\
    \ while preserving\nprivacy, suitable access control schemes will need to be devised\
    \ to allow for responsible\naccess to users of this data. A well-defined hierarchy\
    \ of data users will need to be\ndeveloped and implemented to limit access only\
    \ to intended authorized personnel.\nInformation flow control should also be employed\
    \ that can track data flow as access\nto it is made and to detect any violation\
    \ of access or usage rules. Moreover, data\nmashups that will occur in the cloud\
    \ where multiple entities merge their data to\nwork on some common goal, should\
    \ be carried out with proper oversight.\nData\nanonymization may also be required\
    \ in such a scenario where specific values may be\nconverted in to a range perhaps\
    \ ( e.g., using k-anonymity [90]) and unwanted data be\ndeleted as necessary.\
    \ Blockchain has been suggested to be used for access control as\nwell as access\
    \ tracking of users in IoT applications where each user access to a service\n\
    or an application ends up as a transaction to form the applications IoT trail\
    \ [98].\n3.5.1.3\nData Injection/Data Integrity\nData injection refers to the\
    \ injection\nof false information or modification information about a user in\
    \ the system after\ngaining access. Since data is typically stored in databases,\
    \ SQL injection involves\nan attacker inserting queries to modify data or make\
    \ false data insertions into the\ndatabase. This can have far reaching consequences\
    \ for smart city applications such\nas patient record manipulation as well as\
    \ manipulation or deletion of government\nrecords. SQL injection prevention schemes\
    \ involve the validation of data before using\nit [99] such as positive pattern\
    \ matching. It also involves limiting database access\nbased on the user requirements\
    \ and performing penetration testing.\n3.5.2\nNetwork Layer\nLike other networks,\
    \ the IoT in Smart Cities are also susceptible to network attacks\nsuch as Denial\
    \ of service, Eavesdropping, Man in the middle attack, Side Channel\nand spoofing\
    \ attacks [100]. We discuss these attacks and discuss remedial actions\nthat should\
    \ be taken to prevent them.\n3.5.2.1\nMan in the Middle Attack\nMan in the middle\
    \ (MITM) attack refers\nto the interception of data on the network by faking the\
    \ identity of a network node\nor device. This is carried out by appearing as the\
    \ intended recipient to the sender\n25\nand the original sender to the recipient\
    \ by unauthorized actors. To prevent this,\nthe exchange of data between two entities\
    \ should employ cryptographic protocols\nwhich can ensure secure communication.\
    \ Many public networks do not make use of\nencryption when exchanging data, this\
    \ endangers user data and can give access to\nunwanted persons to user information\
    \ [90]. Policies need to be devised to allow for\nsuitable data communication\
    \ standards for such networks while keeping the user as\nwell as commercial interests\
    \ in mind.\n3.5.2.2\nEavesdropping/Sniffing Attack\nEavesdropping refers to the\
    \ listening\nof data on the network. In eavesdropping an unauthorized entity joins\
    \ the network\nand can listen to the data that is being exchanged between the\
    \ devices on the network.\nTo avoid this, strategies include the use of authenticate\
    \ always protocols which initiate\nauthentication steps whenever devices need\
    \ to communicate with each other. This will\nensure that no unwanted users are\
    \ allowed access to network traffic to prevent such\nattacks. Moreover, industry\
    \ standard security protocols such as the Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), Wi-Fi\
    \ Protected Access 2 (WPA2) should be used for authenticating\nremote access.\
    \ Furthermore, remote sessions should have time-outs implemented to\nensure that\
    \ mistakes are not made by forgetful employees.\n3.5.2.3\nSide Channel Attack\n\
    Side Channel Attacks refer to the extraction\nof information by observing operation\
    \ characteristics of the implemented computer\nalgorithms or systems such as power\
    \ consumed, time taken, traffic analysis, fault\nanalysis, acoustic analysis [101].\
    \ Side Channel attacks don’t give nonpermitted parties\naccess to the data within\
    \ the network but may allow them to determine important\ninformation about the\
    \ system, such as the protocol used, or allow them to drop\npackets so as to degrade\
    \ performance of the network. One solution to counter network\ntraffic side channels\
    \ attacks is to saturate network bandwidth to prevent patterns\nfrom being observed.\
    \ Another popular method of preventing side channel attacks is\nto make use of\
    \ masking [102].\n3.5.2.4\nDenial of Service Attack\nDenial of Service (DOS) or\
    \ Distributed DOS\n(DDOS) attacks involve an entity getting access to the network\
    \ and using legitimate\nnodes within it to flood the target with unnecessary requests\
    \ to consume network\nbandwidth and degrade quality of service. With a smart city\
    \ depending on sensors\nto provide it with a ‘view’ of the city, DOS attacks can\
    \ make the smart city system\nblind which can lead to loss of property and life.\
    \ Countermeasures for DOS attacks\ninvolve anomaly detection by monitoring of\
    \ network data to check for any irregular\nbehavior. Artificial Intelligence has\
    \ found applications in this area as noted by [103],\nfor, e.g., it has been used\
    \ to identify abnormal data in smart grids [104] as well as\ndetecting attacks\
    \ [105, 106].\n3.5.2.5\nSpoofing Attack\nIn a spoofing attack, an attacker adds\
    \ itself to the\nnetwork by appearing to be a legitimate device on the network,\
    \ thereby allowing\nthem to send irregular or abnormal data to upset normal operation\
    \ of a smart city\n26\nsystem. Due to the varying nature and types of IoT devices\
    \ having different levels of\nbuilt-in security, spoofing is a particularly dangerous\
    \ attack for IoT systems. Methods\nto prevent spoofing are the use of cryptography,\
    \ hybrid encryption [107] as well as the\nuse of blockchain [108] to validate\
    \ data exchange and as well as authenticate devices.\n3.5.3\nPerception Layer\n\
    Perception layers attacks refer to physical attacks on an IoT based smart city\
    \ system.\nThis requires the physical presence of an attacker near the sensing\
    \ elements in an IoT\nsystem. We cover these attacks to provide a holistic assessment\
    \ of the security and\nprivacy issues in IoT Smart Cities. Tempering and Radio\
    \ Interference (jamming)\nare attacks which can affect the performance of smart\
    \ city systems. Tempering may\noccur during the development or the manufacturing\
    \ process while jamming can take\nplace due to a generation of radio frequencies\
    \ which interfere with the frequencies\nused by devices on the network to exchange\
    \ data. To circumvent this, policies may\nbe incorporated into software which\
    \ alert businesses and other Smart City partners\nto missing or abnormal data\
    \ from sensing devices.\n3.5.4\nSystem Wide Issues\n3.5.4.1\nData Leakage\nData\
    \ leakage refers to the unintentional conveyance of\ninformation about subjects\
    \ in smart cities. The many data sources in smart cities\nmay contain information\
    \ related to a user’s identity, health, quality of life etc. Smart\nCity application\
    \ managers use this data to improve their services and provide a bet-\nter user\
    \ experience, however, it is possible that this data might be shared with third\n\
    party entities. It is therefore necessary to anonymize data before such assignments\n\
    are taken. Data leakage can also take place when devices within a network perform\n\
    discovery tasks and may provide personal information to rogue nodes in the network.\n\
    In Smart Grids, power consumption data should be anonymized by considering the\n\
    data on a neighborhood level rather than on the individual level, moreover, systems\n\
    could be installed in homes using batteries to modify the demand response signal.\n\
    Data aggregation is an important tool in preserving individual privacy and preventing\n\
    data leakage. Moreover, data should be encrypted when sending it over the network\n\
    so that any unauthorized access is avoided. Another strategy would be to use data\n\
    minimization. Typically, sensors used in smart cities will gather data of less\
    \ ‘interest’\nin addition to data of interest. For, e.g., navigation systems many\
    \ times record loca-\ntion information even when not in use or video applications\
    \ such as facial recognition\nsystems typically record other activities apart\
    \ from being activated whenever a face is\nobserved in the video. This extra information\
    \ increases the risk of data leakage. Data\nminimization can be employed in such\
    \ cases to limit the data that is being gathered\non the user.\n3.5.4.2\nTrustworthiness\n\
    Apart from the technical steps that need to be taken\nto provide a secure usage\
    \ experience of smart city applications and to encourage its\nuse, it is important\
    \ that smart city users be provided clear policy guidelines to how\n27\nTable\

    \ are the fact that they provide an improved quality of life for\na city’s population\
    \ along with reduction of costs in terms of operation and also enable\ncities\
    \ to be sustainable. IoT enables sensors and devices to be deployed throughout\
    \ a\ncity to give an overview of the state of the city’s main functions such as\
    \ transportation\nsystems, electric, water and gas distribution as well as crime\
    \ monitoring to name\na few. This real time information helps city administration,\
    \ businesses and other\nstakeholders to provide better services to people, increase\
    \ the effectiveness of those\nservices and reduce the cost through efficient operation.\n\
    On the technical side, IoT data has made possible to use data analytics to gauge\n\
    various aspects of the multitude of services which are being provided in the city\
    \ as\nwell as to determine interactions between them and utilize that information\
    \ for better\ndecision making to make life easier for citizens. Furthermore, the\
    \ distributed nature\nof IoT systems and the flexible architectures which enable\
    \ fluidity through movement\nof sensing units is easily scalable thereby requiring\
    \ little additional cost to upgrade\nand expand currently deployed systems. Moreover,\
    \ this distributed architecture also\nmakes such systems very robust to faults\
    \ thereby increasing reliability of deployments\nand offering self-healing in\
    \ applications such as electricity systems.\n29\n4.2\nWeaknesses\nIoT in Smart\
    \ cities do suffer from some weaknesses in terms of technology, for, e.g.,\nthe\
    \ current deployment scenario has a myriad of different technologies relating\
    \ to\nnetworks, hardware platforms and software frameworks which do not often\
    \ work to-\ngether very well as discussed. Different standards’ bodies such as\
    \ the IETF, European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), IEEE and\
    \ other organizations have\nbeen contributing with standards for communication,\
    \ network discovery, identifica-\ntion, management of devices etc. However, the\
    \ sheer number of ‘standards’ with\nmany of them not being compatible with each\
    \ other has not fully solved the inter-\noperability problem and this can cause\
    \ hurdles for expansion of IoT systems without\na significant overhaul of system\
    \ components. Another problem currently facing IoT\nsystems is the lack of data\
    \ policies and legislation. The concern here is that data\npolicies are not mature\
    \ enough to regulate how data is handled in IoT systems, as\nhas been discussed\
    \ previously. This is a major problem given the growing issue with\nuser data\
    \ privacy in a connected world.\n4.3\nOpportunities\nIoT in Smart cities presents\
    \ many opportunities to researchers and businesses alike\nin lieu of mitigating\
    \ the weaknesses and also in the provision of new city services.\nThe data gathered\
    \ by the sensors in IoT systems has the potential to provide a\nholistic overview\
    \ of the city’s state allowing for the use of big data algorithms to\ndevelop\
    \ new applications and services. For researchers in the data analytics domain,\n\
    this heterogenous data provides a wonderful opportunity for the development of\
    \ new\ndata science algorithms for service delivery. There is a large monetary\
    \ value towards\nthe development and usage of computationally cheap encryption\
    \ techniques, efficient\ndata storage methods and networking technologies to make\
    \ IoT deployment easier\nand cheaper.\nDevelopment of new sensor technologies\
    \ is another opportunity for\nresearchers in IoT for smart cities.\nThe development\
    \ of newer, efficient, low-cost\nsensors would aid to the creation of IoT services\
    \ and enable even wider usage.\n4.4\nThreats\nWith a connected system, there are\
    \ several threats that come with IoTs for Smart\nCities involving trust issues\
    \ among users, privacy concerns due to network attacks,\npotential data theft\
    \ etc. Privacy and security are the most important concerns of\nIoT applications,\
    \ with such a personalized interaction mechanism between people\nand devices as\
    \ is the case of smart cities, the risks for privacy breaches, data theft\nand\
    \ leakages are high and this is a constant concern for service users as well as\n\
    providers. Numerous attacks on Smart City systems have exposed the vulnerability\n\
    of this technology to cyber attacks and also demonstrated the consequences that\
    \ it\nhas on the population. Traditional security procedures and methods such\
    \ as access\nauthentication, routing and networking might not be enough or possible\
    \ in many IoT\ndeployments due to IoT devices typically not having sufficient\
    \ computing capabilities,\n30\nthis has exacerbated the privacy and security concerns\
    \ for IoT stakeholders. This can\nalso feed to a lack of trust by customers to\
    \ participate in smart city applications.\n5\nConclusions\nThis chapter presented\
    \ a broad coverage of the Internet of Things in Smart Cities.\nProviding a detailed\
    \ discussion of Smart Cities and its different domains, IoT was\npresented as\
    \ a vital enabler of smart city services and the various smart city architec-\n\
    tures and the challenges that are faced in the deployment of smart city applications\n\
    were deliberated upon. This was followed by a review of the sensing and networking\n\
    technologies used for such applications Finally, the security and privacy issues\
    \ faced\nby IoT based Smart Cities were discussed and a SWOT analysis is provided.\n\
    31\nCHAPTER III\nAI IN IOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides\
    \ insight into different ways in which AI has been applied in\nthe IoT for Smart\
    \ Cities using the application of clustering, regression, classification\netc.\
    \ In addition, various applications, solutions and data used for implementing\
    \ the\noverall framework of Smart Cities are discussed in detail. along with the\
    \ types of\ndeployment used by these proposed approaches.\n2\nBig Data Algorithms/Artificial\
    \ Intelligence\nThe various sensors that make up the internet of things in a smart\
    \ city relay in-\nformation about the city’s state to the cloud. However, measuring\
    \ raw data is not\nenough, to utilize this data and to make the city ‘smart’,\
    \ data analysis is key. Data\nanalysis in smart cities has four layers, the first\
    \ is Data Acquisition, which deals with\nthe collection and storage of data, this\
    \ is followed by the Preprocessing layer which\nperforms operations (such as imputing\
    \ missing values, scaling, removing erroneous\ndata points etc.) on the data to\
    \ ensure that data is of suitable quality to be used for\nthe data analytics stage.\
    \ The data analytics stage involves the application of data\nscience techniques\
    \ on the data to extract patterns and insights which would be used\nfor policy\
    \ making, planning and other actions in the Service layer. In this section, we\n\
    focus our attention on the third stage of the data analysis process, i.e., data\
    \ analytics.\nData analytics in the Smart City based on the IoT involves the use\
    \ of Deep Learning\nand Machine Learning on the gathered data. The discussion\
    \ in this chapter considers\nthe following aspects of the use of AI (ML/DL) in\
    \ the IoT for smart cities:\n1. The type of application: This refers to the aim\
    \ of the application.\n2. Algorithm/Network: This refers to the algorithm being\
    \ used to perform the\ntask and can be any of the ML/DL algorithms covered.\n\
    3. System Architecture: System architecture refers to the IoT architecture pro-\n\
    posed for the covered work. This can be Cloud, Fog or Edge.\n4. Task: This refers\
    \ to the type of machine learning task being performed. This can\nbe classification,\
    \ clustering or regression. In this category, a brief description is\nalso presented\
    \ about what quantities/outcomes are being worked with.\n32\n5. Data Type: This\
    \ refers to the type of data being used. Data can be of two\ntypes, heterogeneous\
    \ or homogeneous. Heterogeneous refers to the use of data\nof different modalities\
    \ whereas homogenous refers to a single modality being\nused. The aim of providing\
    \ this information is to capture the complexity of the\ndata involved in an application.\n\
    2.1\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) has been a crucial element of smart\
    \ city application develop-\nment [109], helping in prediction (classification),\
    \ estimation (regression) and cluster-\ning tasks. Machine learning refers to\
    \ the set of approaches through which computers\ncan be used to learn from empirical\
    \ data [110] and has been used in smart cities\nin various applications. Since\
    \ there has been a lot of work in this area using ML\nalgorithms, we focus on\
    \ work in the last few years. It was found that most commonly\nused ML algorithms\
    \ have been the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests\n(RF), Decision Tree\
    \ (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)\nand Logistic Regression\
    \ (LR).\n2.2\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning is the use of successive layers of\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to\nlearn patterns. The idea is that successive\
    \ non-linear layers of interconnected artificial\nneurons can be used to learn\
    \ patterns in data that simple machine learning algorithms\nmight not be able\
    \ to do. Deep learning architectures can process noisy data to provide\noutput\
    \ for classification and prediction tasks. This makes them very useful in the\n\
    Smart City environment where the IoT enables the collection of heterogeneous sensor\n\
    data which can be of varying nature. Data derived from sensors can be processed\
    \ to\nextract features or can be fed directly to deep learning algorithms which\
    \ can perform\nboth feature extraction as well as classification/prediction. Deep\
    \ Learning methods\nsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)(Long Short-Term Machines\
    \ (LSTM) and\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU)), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\
    \ Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNN) and Stacked Autoencoder Networks (SAE) were the\
    \ preferred deep\nlearning methodologies used for smart city applications and\
    \ our discussion revolves\naround the utilization of these methods.\n3\nAI Applications\
    \ for Smart Cities\nIn this section, the applications for of AI in smart cities\
    \ have been discussed, we also\nmention the kind of deployment as well as the\
    \ nature of data utilized to achieve their\ntask.\n3.1\nSmart Agriculture\nThe\
    \ major applications of AI in IoT for agriculture are crop monitoring/disease\
    \ de-\ntection and data driven crop care and decision making. Considering the\
    \ scarcity of\n33\nwater, the authors in [111, 112, 113] develop irrigation systems\
    \ which monitor and\ncontrol the amount of water being used for crops, all structured\
    \ around a cloud com-\nputing system. This problem has been devised both as a\
    \ classification as well as a\nregression problem as in [114], who develop a closed\
    \ loop water irrigation system using\nsupport vector regression and K-Means clustering.\
    \ The authors in [115, 116] propose\ncloud based greenhouse monitoring systems\
    \ using images and a host of physical pa-\nrameters from plants such as temperature,\
    \ humidity and light using several machine\nand deep learning methods. Plant disease\
    \ detection is also an important task within\nsmart agriculture and has been worked\
    \ on by the authors in [117, 118, 119, 120] who\npresent schemes for disease detection\
    \ for various crops including tomatoes and pota-\ntoes. The proliferation of sensing\
    \ systems in agricultural fields has also provided an\navenue for data driven\
    \ decision making and planning for farmers. This involves pre-\ndicting various\
    \ physical parameters which can affect crop growth like solar radiance\n[121]\
    \ and temperature, humidity, windspeed [122, 123, 124, 125, 126] to help in deci-\n\
    sion making in terms of plant care but also classification systems for recommending\n\
    crops to be sown [127, 128]. It is important to note that all of these implementations\n\
    are cloud based.\nThere have been some suggested methodologies for bringing fog\
    \ processing for AI\nin smart agriculture, for, e.g., in [129] a deep learning\
    \ entrusted to fog nodes (DLEFN)\nalgorithm is described to support efficient\
    \ use of resources and reduce cloud resource\nusage. However, as noted in [130],\
    \ who use an edge system for temperature prediction\nusing an LSTM, edge device\
    \ performance still lacks that of similar cloud systems but\nthe inclusion of\
    \ DL capable hardware does provide opportunities for further innova-\ntions. Previous\
    \ work by the same author [131], where they aimed to monitor crops\nfor frost\
    \ signs and trigger anti-frost measures, compared edge and cloud computing\nsystems\
    \ for outlier detection and determined that cloud implementations to provide\n\
    much better performance. However, they do note the potential for edge systems\
    \ to\nprovide highly responsive data analytics in smart agriculture. More applications\
    \ can\nbe envisaged for AI deployment in smart agriculture, for, e.g., monitoring\
    \ of crop\ngrowth, selection of the fertilizer and the timeline for it to be used\
    \ as well as targeted\napplication, pest detection and intelligent pesticide spraying\
    \ so as to reduce harm to\nthe environment, environmental monitoring to track\
    \ the effects of climate change and\nmore. Some of these applications have potential\
    \ to be deployed as edge computing\nsystems. A summary of the use of IoT based\
    \ AI in Smart Agriculture is presented in\nTable 7.\n3.2\nSmart City Services\n\
    A popular component of smart city initiatives is the management of waste and involves\n\
    having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud to not only inform\
    \ the\nrelevant authorities of the need to empty them but also using AI to determine\
    \ the\nbest route to reduce fuel consumption. The use of IoT systems for waste\
    \ management\nhas been observed in the works of [133] who utilize IoT systems\
    \ to help reduce energy\nwastage in waste collection by municipalities. Hussain\
    \ et al. [134] develop a waste\nmanagement system that not only determines if\
    \ bins are full and need collecting\n34\nTable 7. AI use for Smart Agriculture\n\

    \ air quality\naround it using RNNs. The sensing modalities in each of these applications\
    \ is pretty\nsimilar in that they indicate to whether a waste bin is full or not\
    \ which is then\nused for route planning. Considering the requirements of such\
    \ a system, in terms\nof implementation, all of these systems are cloud based.\
    \ Sewer monitoring has been\nperformed in [135] in a cloud based system, they\
    \ use sewer water level and rain gauge\ndata along with a RNN to perform sewer\
    \ overflow monitoring. The RNN is used to\npredict sewer overflow ahead in time.\
    \ Water quality has monitoring has been the focus\nof [136, 137, 138] where the\
    \ authors use multiple sensors measuring pH value, chloride,\nnitrate content\
    \ and hardness of water to determine whether it is fit for drinking or\nnot. In\
    \ [139], Liu et al. use data from water monitoring stations along the Yangtze\n\
    river to predict water quality. Like the classification-based systems, they use\
    \ multiple\nchemical measurements from the water such as oxygen, pH, turbidity\
    \ etc. Apart from\nair quality, smart city monitoring systems are an important\
    \ application within the\nsmart city services domain. This includes urban noise,\
    \ which has been the focus of\nresearchers in [140, 141] as well as other more\
    \ comprehensive monitoring systems as\nproposed in [142, 143]. All these systems\
    \ are cloud based and use a combination\nof sensors for sound and/or image data\
    \ for performing noise monitoring/detection\nand various smart city dashboard\
    \ applications. In Table 8, we summarize the type\nof deployments, applications\
    \ task and data for smart city services applications. It\nis noted that most of\
    \ the applications relating to city services such as air quality\nmonitoring and\
    \ prediction, sewer monitoring, waste collection have been proposed as\ncloud\
    \ systems as data needs to be collected from nodes at various points in a city.\n\
    It is envisaged that due to the nature of the applications, many smart city services\n\
    would still rely on cloud or fog architectures as the decision-making taking place\
    \ in\nsuch situations isn’t possible on only a local level. It is also observed\
    \ that most of the\napplications required data from multiple sensors and therefore\
    \ utilized heterogeneous\ndata to carry out the task at hand.\n3.3\nSmart Energy\n\
    Load/energy consumption forecasting is an essential task for monitoring and control\n\
    of electrical power supply in the electricity grid and ensure appropriate demand\
    \ side\nmanagement. It has been performed by the authors of [148] who use data\
    \ collected\nfrom consumers in a smart grid to determine load for up to 24 h in\
    \ advance. They treat\nthis as primarily a clustering problem where they form\
    \ clusters of similar load profiles\nand then use distance functions to determine\
    \ energy consumption for the future. The\nauthors in [149] also use a cloud based\
    \ clustering approach, using historical power\ndata, they use K-Means clustering\
    \ to determine the closest historical records and then\ncombine them to predict\
    \ energy consumption 24 h in advance. The load forecasting\nproblem has been dealt\
    \ as a regression by [150] using a SVM and by [151] through an\nRNN using electricity\
    \ power data. A regression approach is also followed by [152, 153]\nwho use electricity\
    \ consumption in addition to environmental data for load forecasting\nusing deep\
    \ learning methods (DNN and a combination of Autoencoders and RNNs\n(GRU)). Edge\
    \ based systems have been suggested by the authors of [154, 155, 156]\n36\nTable\

    \ grid management/monitoring is also a\nnecessary application in this domain.\
    \ The authors in [157] use decision trees in a cloud\nbased system to classify\
    \ between different faults in a smart grid. In [158], the authors\nuse power consumption\
    \ data from consumers in China to determine electricity theft\nin a cloud based\
    \ system. They use wide and deep convolutional neural networks to\ncapture the\
    \ periodic and nonperiodic components from electricity consumption data\nand show\
    \ their network to be suitable for electricity theft detection. The authors in\n\
    [159] present a framework for edge computing based monitoring of the smart grid.\n\

    \ two major applications of IoT with AI in health, these are activity recog-\n\
    nition/fall detection and disease diagnosis/health monitoring, a summary of the\
    \ IoT\nbased AI systems used in Smart Health is presented in Table 10. Activity\
    \ recog-\nnition involves the use of movement sensors such as accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes and\nmagnetometers with the aim to help provide the user with feedback\
    \ on their health.\nThis can be in terms of them having enough physical exercise\
    \ or not, used for sports\ntherapy, fall detection and for monitoring of different\
    \ diseases such as Parkinson’s or\nother motor degenerative ailments. The most\
    \ popular sensor for activity recognition\nare inertial sensors which have been\
    \ used by [160, 161] in a cloud based setting using\nvarious deep and machine\
    \ learning algorithms. In [162], Castro et al. include vital\nsign data in addition\
    \ to movement information for human activity recognition in a\ncloud environment,\
    \ they utilize the DT as their classifier. In [163],, the authors pro-\npose an\
    \ edge-based system to perform activity recognition for people by recording\n\
    their movements using the accelerometer and gyroscope present on the phone. They\n\
    use a SVM as their classifier and differentiate between six different activities\
    \ of daily\nliving. Fall detection has been performed by [164, 165] in a fog and\
    \ edge environment,\nrespectively, using an accelerometer, Santos et al. [164]\
    \ use a CNN while Yacchirema\net al. [165] useRFCwith both approaches showing\
    \ promising results.\nEquipped with the power of AI in IoT, Smart Health systems\
    \ facilitate the provi-\nsion of telehealth services as well as real time monitoring\
    \ of patients, giving doctors\nand patients feedback on their health.\nHealth\
    \ monitoring systems and real time\ndisease diagnosis have been one of the most\
    \ important applications of IoT technol-\nogy. The authors in [166, 167, 168,\
    \ 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176] develop\ncloud based health monitoring\
    \ systems for detecting various types of diseases, such\n38\nas heart (stroke\
    \ [167], irregular sound [169], irregular rhythm [171, 173]), epilep-\ntic seizures\
    \ [172], Parkinson seizure [176] and multiple disease diagnosis systems\n[174,\
    \ 175]. In [174, 175], the authors formulate the problem of disease diagnosis\
    \ as\na classification problem and utilize medical data such as ECGs, EEG, heart\
    \ rate,\nblood pressure, blood sugar, heart sound, blood glucose, liver health\
    \ along with var-\nious machine and deep learning methods to achieve this task.\
    \ Fog and edge based\nhealth monitoring/disease diagnosis systems have also been\
    \ suggested by a number\nof researchers. The authors in [177] present a fog based\
    \ system using a deep neural\nnetwork to detect heart disease from a patients\
    \ vital signs (blood oxygen, heart rate,\nrespiration rate, EEG, ECG, EMG, blood\
    \ pressure, glucose) and activity data. In\n[178], Devarajan & Ravi work on a\
    \ fog computing based Parkinson detection system\nusing a persons speech. Moreover,\
    \ an edge computing system is presented in [179]\nwhich utilizes EEG signals to\
    \ determine seizures in patients.\nTable 10. AI use for Smart Health\nApplication\n\

    \ Smart Homes.\nThis is especially\nneeded for the elderly and is typically achieved\
    \ by the use of ambient sensors, Wi-Fi\nand radio frequency systems in smart homes.\
    \ In this work, we include all monitoring\nmethods that depend on sensors placed\
    \ in the home/within the smart home domain.\nIn [182], Pirzada et al. use a network\
    \ of reed switches connected to the cloud to\nmonitor the activities of elderly\
    \ people as a clustering problem. They use the K-\nNN algorithm to determine anomalies\
    \ in the daily activities which can then be used\nto send medical or other help\
    \ requests to assist people. A similar setup for activity\nrecognition for ambient\
    \ assisted living has been presented in [183, 184, 185] where they\nuse data from\
    \ a number of different sensors including motion, presence, water float,\ntemperature\
    \ etc to determine various activities being performed in a home. In [186],\na\
    \ cloud based assisted living system for the deaf has been developed that performs\n\
    haptic conversions for sounds detected in a home. An array of sensors are used\
    \ to\nmonitor environmental sound and the authors use RNNs for detecting the sound\n\
    event before its passed on to the haptic vibration producer. Another task within\n\
    in monitoring is localization of people, this part of smart homes is also applicable\n\
    to smart infrastructure in that such systems are used in smart buildings as well.\n\
    Applications of localization include security, i.e., detecting unauthorized presence\n\
    and people monitoring in general (for, e.g., locating elderly people in homes)\
    \ etc.\nThe authors in [187] perform localization using a grid of Wi-Fi units\
    \ that measure\nsignal strength to determine peoples locations indoors for buildings.\
    \ They formulate\nthis both as a classification problem as well as a regression\
    \ problem. The classification\nproblem being formulated as coded locations (for,\
    \ e.g., a given room no) while the\nregression case estimating the location of\
    \ the user in a coordinate grid. Their system is\ncloud based and they use a deep\
    \ neural network to perform this task and have found\nsuitably good results. Occupancy\
    \ detection has been performed by the authors of\n[188] making use of various\
    \ ambient measurements (temperature, humidity, pressure\netc.) and passing them\
    \ to a cloud before using a deep neural network to classify\nbetween the various\
    \ number of people present in an indoor environment. In [189],\nZimmermann et\
    \ al. also make use of ambient sensors for the occupancy problem and\nuse a na¨ıve\
    \ bayes learner to determine both the presence of occupants as well as their\n\
    number.\nHome automation is another application that the IoT finds application\n\
    within the Smart Home domain. The integration of AI has helped develop smart\n\
    home automation systems that aim to reduce energy consumption in homes as well\n\
    as maintain user privacy, security. Chowdhry et al. [190] use a combination of\
    \ visual\ndata and motion sensing to perform home automation for security using\
    \ a SVM.\nAn interesting use of AI in home automation is presented in [191] who\
    \ develop a\ncloud based home automation system, they take measurements from various\
    \ ambient\nsensors and control appliances and use a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to\
    \ determine which\ntechnician to call whenever sensor measurements appear aberrated.\
    \ The problem of\nintelligent consumption of energy has been considered by [192]\
    \ who develop an energy\ndisaggregation system on the appliance level in smart\
    \ homes using stacked denoising\nautoencoders. They achieve this using power data\
    \ for individual appliances as well\n40\nas the total power consumed in the home\
    \ and send it to a local cloud. Data is then\ndisaggregated for various appliances\
    \ to provide feedback to the user.\nMore work\nproviding energy intelligence to\
    \ consumers has been performed by [193, 194, 195].\nKonstantakopoulos et al. [195]\
    \ pose this as a regression problem, they propose a\ncloud-based system utilizing\
    \ both ambient sensor data (lighting, temperature etc)\nand appliance power data\
    \ to forecast resource usage for consumers using a RNN.\nThey show a reduction\
    \ in energy consumption for their users using this information.\nEventhough applications\
    \ covered in smart homes have been cloud based systems,\nthere have been recent\
    \ proposals for frameworks that combine edge and cloud pro-\ncessing as in [196]\
    \ who discuss a hierarchical control system for smart homes through\na edge microgrid\
    \ and a cloud power grid. Due to the nature of smart homes in that\nthe sensing\
    \ scheme is present within a finite space (within the home), edge and fog\ncomputing\
    \ based systems are expected to be increasingly incorporated smart home\napplications.\
    \ A summary of the use of IoT based AI in Smart Homes is presented in\nTable 11.\n\
    3.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the major applications of AI in the IoT powered smart\
    \ industry is towards\nfault detection in products and anomaly detection in industrial\
    \ processes. This has\nseen the use of both Machine Learning (SVM [197, 198],RFC[199,\
    \ 200]) as well as\nDeep Learning (DNN [201, 202, 203], CNN [204]) methods using\
    \ a cloud computing\nstructure to perform anomaly detection/product inspection\
    \ and monitoring using a\nvariety of heterogeneous and homogenous data sources\
    \ such as inertial sensors for ma-\nchines, images for products and processes\
    \ and other process specific variables. Other\napproaches suggested in [205, 206]\
    \ propose a fog computing method along with edge\ncomputing systems suggested\
    \ in [207, 208]. An edge computing system for anomaly\ndetection is presented\
    \ in [209] where edge devices collaboratively train a deep anomaly\ndetection\
    \ model. Production management is another application that has found usage\nof\
    \ AI in IoT based smart Industry. For, e.g., the authors in [210, 211, 212, 213,\
    \ 214]\nuse cloud based data driven systems along with machine and deep learning\
    \ algorithms\nto help with task dispatching, performance analysis as well as worker\
    \ activity recog-\nnition utilizing a variety of sensing modalities. The work\
    \ of [213, 214] are especially\ninteresting as they aim is to not only perform\
    \ production management but also pro-\npose data for various health related analysis\
    \ to create a safer working environment\non the factory floor. A fog system for\
    \ production management has been presented in\n[215] who use activity data to\
    \ determine resource allocation locations to contribute\nto management of a production\
    \ operation. Furthermore, product inspection, which\nis a common application of\
    \ instrumentation systems in a factory, has been performed\nby [216, 217] who\
    \ utilize images and sensor data in a cloud based system to monitor\nproduct quality.\n\
    A factory has a multitude of machines and equipment working round the clock\n\
    manufacturing goods. Maintenance is an important aspect of this operation where\n\
    regular checks are performed on the equipment to ensure that no breakdown occurs\n\
    during the production process, which might result in monetary loss or loss of\
    \ life.\n41\nTable 11. AI use for Smart Homes\nApplication\nNetwork\nSystem\n\

    \ with the data gathered by various sensors on these machines, it is often\nmore\
    \ beneficial to take an active approach rather than a passive one by using this\n\
    data for predictive maintenance purposes. Predictive maintenance utilizes data\
    \ from\nthe daily operation of machines in an industry to optimize the manufacturing\
    \ op-\neration [218] and is one of the main uses for AI in the industry. In [219,\
    \ 220], the\nauthors suggest a predictive maintenance scheme using SVMs utilizing\
    \ data from ac-\ncelerometers measuring vibration in a crane motor and data from\
    \ various sources in\na semiconductor manufacturing process, respectively, both\
    \ work in a cloud environ-\nment as evidenced from the architecture. Prediction\
    \ of failure can also be a regression\noperation, as was demonstrated by [221]\
    \ who use RNNs to predict future values of\na physical parameters of a pump using\
    \ a number of heterogeneous sensors used to\nmonitor it. As with the other two\
    \ systems, this system also had a cloud architecture.\nThe authors in [170] also\
    \ present a regression based health prognosis system for the\nindustry using a\
    \ CNN on machine data (Images, stress, temperature, vibration, po-\n42\nsition\
    \ and electromagnetic signal measurements). The use of IoT based AI in Smart\n\
    Industry has been presented in Table 12.\n3.7\nSmart Infrastructure\nAn application\
    \ within smart infrastructures also involves monitoring of civil structures\n\
    for structural health. The authors in [222] take a clustering approach to perform\n\
    health monitoring of a bridge using vibration data in a cloud setting.\nThey use\n\
    clustering to determine clusters of abnormal behavior in accelerometer measurements\n\
    from a bridge. In [223, 224, 225], accelerometer signals have been used where\
    \ as [226]\nhave used piezo electric transducers for performing structural health\
    \ monitoring of\nbridges formulated as a classification problem between different\
    \ damaged states of\na bridge. The prime sensing modality for monitoring has been\
    \ measuring vibration\nusing accelerometers, however, other sensors such as fiber\
    \ optic gratings can also be\nused to measure stress.\nThe second avenue for AI\
    \ applications in IoT for smart infrastructure is the use\nof IoT devices for\
    \ building environment control and energy management as well com-\nfort aware\
    \ control. This involves the prediction of building energy usage based on\nenvironmental\
    \ data (such as temperature, humidity) and electrical power data. The\nauthors\
    \ in [227] and [228] use electric power data and heat flow information in a\n\
    building to predict the energy requirements in the future so as to better manage\
    \ en-\nergy consumption. Ambience control of a museum has been performed in [229]\
    \ where\nthe authors use deep learning algorithms to predict the CO2 and humidity\
    \ levels\nfor the care of exhibits. Comfort aware energy management has been performed\
    \ in\n[230] where the authors use a CNN to regulate thermal comfort in a building\
    \ using\nvarious physical quantities. It can be noted that all of these mentioned\
    \ systems have\nbeen deployed in the cloud, this is due to the nature of the application.\
    \ However,\nthere have been efforts for developing fog/edge systems for smart\
    \ infrastructure. The\nauthors in [231] describe a framework for deploying edge\
    \ and fog computing services\nin smart buildings and demonstrate their systems\
    \ effectiveness for the case of energy\nmanagement. Table 13 summarizes the use\
    \ of IoT based AI in Smart Infrastructure.\n3.8\nSmart Transport\nMajor smart\
    \ transportation applications involve smart parking and transportation\nmanagement.\
    \ Smart parking aims to solve the problem of helping users finding park-\ning\
    \ spots in order to save time as well as reduce gas emissions and is therefore\
    \ a much-\nresearched topic for AI deployment towards smart transportation. Solutions\
    \ to this\nproblem have been formulated both as a regression problem as well as\
    \ a classification\none, both utilizing imaging and/or other occupancy sensing\
    \ modalities. Regression\nsolutions [232, 233, 234] are typically used to predict\
    \ a parking lots occupancy levels\nin the future whereas classification systems\
    \ [235, 236, 237] involve guiding drivers ac-\ncording to the shortest distance\
    \ as well as used for user localization purposes within\nsuch lots. In addition\
    \ to cloud based approaches, edge computing systems for smart\nparking have also\
    \ been devised as suggested in [238, 239] who deploy CNNs on edge\n43\nTable 12.\

    \ respectively. Another applica-\ntion of AI IoT for smart transportation involves\
    \ determining traffic flow as well as\nprediction of traffic flow for traffic\
    \ light control and other management tasks such as\naccident detection. In this\
    \ regard, video cameras are popular for detection of vehicle\ndensity on roads\
    \ for traffic congestion determination. However, with most cars having\na GPS\
    \ device and the commonality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\n\
    use the data from the GPS along with weather and generic traffic flow information\n\
    to determine traffic prediction. The nature of traffic flow prediction using sensing\n\
    modalities such as GPS require systems to be operated as cloud-based systems as\n\
    is the case in [240, 241, 242, 243]. Of these, Wangyang et al. [242] and Xiao\
    \ et al.\n[243] use deep learning based sequential modeling approaches to predict\
    \ traffic flow\nahead of time where as Aung & Naing [240] and Yunxiang Liu & Wu\
    \ [241] solve this\nthrough a classification formulation. A traffic management\
    \ system for public buses\nhas been proposed in [33, 244] where GPS data is used\
    \ to predict bus arrival times\nfor public transportation systems. Accident detection\
    \ has been performed using car\nposition and velocity information in a Vehicular\
    \ Adhoc NETworks (VANET) envi-\nronment by the authors of [245]. They do this\
    \ through a cloud based system that\ncan use this information to predict whether\
    \ an accident has occurred or not. Apart\nfrom typical sensing modalities, with\
    \ smart phones and user participation in social\nmedia, smart transportation systems\
    \ are expected to increasingly include more sens-\ning modalities [246] fused\
    \ together for use in decision making for traffic management\npurposes. Mukherji\
    \ et al. [247] use Wi-Fi signals to determine commuter traffic a\nsubway station.\
    \ They do this by using the measured signal strength of the Wi-Fi\nsignals along\
    \ with a Random Forest classifier in a cloud-based setting. Their system\nis able\
    \ to determine if a person is on the train or on the platform which can be used\n\
    to help with planning train times and routes. A summary of IoT based AI for Smart\n\

    This chapter presents a coverage of combinatorial optimization in IoT based smart\n\
    cities by deliberating on the most popular applications of optimization algorithms\n\
    and providing an insight to how those problems are formulated and worked upon.\
    \ It\nprovides a mapped overview of the optimization landscape in the smart city\
    \ domain\nwhile considering the IoT. Through this mapping, the common optimization\
    \ problems\nacross the various components of the IoT enabled smart city have been\
    \ identified. For\neach problem discussed, the objective function used, the nature\
    \ of the objective as\nwell as the constraints considered have also been elaborated\
    \ on.\n2\nOptimization and Heuristics in IoT Smart Cities\nAs has been observed\
    \ by [249], combinatorial optimization problems in the real-world\nare known to\
    \ be difficult to formulate and generally are hard to solve. Moreover,\nchoosing\
    \ the right algorithm is also a tedious task as each comes with a different\n\
    set of characterizations. This is very applicable to the IoT bases smart city\
    \ where\napplications in each component caters to a different environment and\
    \ aspect of the\ncity’s operation and therefore requires intricate design of the\
    \ problem. This chapter\ntakes guidance from the work of [249]. They note that\
    \ the most popular algorithms for\nuse in combinatorial optimization problems\
    \ are the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm\
    \ Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution\n(DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC).\
    \ Moreover, following from their discussion, six\nfactors are considered for each\
    \ application identified. These are:\n1. The type of application: This refers\
    \ to the problem being optimized within the\nsmart city domain.\n2. Data Setup:\
    \ For each application, we mention the data setup used. While doing\nso, we aim\
    \ to capture the various ways in which researchers have sourced data\nfor their\
    \ proposed method.\n3. Single-Parallel problems: Another thing to note in smart\
    \ city optimization\nproblems is whether a problem has been considered as a single\
    \ problem or\nmultiple sub-problems/parallel.\n4. Objective direction, function\
    \ and number of objectives: Maximization or mini-\nmization, lowest fitness function\
    \ value desirable or higher fitness function value\n49\nis desirable.\nSince we\
    \ list the objectives, we also covere the number of ob-\njectives inherently.\
    \ Single objective, where a single fitness is optimized for its\nbest value or\
    \ multi-objective where multiple objective functions need to be con-\nsidered\
    \ at the same time. The latter is a complex process as some objectives\nmay have\
    \ conflicts and thus requires the need to perform trade-offs with what’s\nacceptable.\n\
    5. Constraints: Constraints are a set of restrictions or prerequisites that may\n\
    sometimes be necessary to determine if a solution is considered valid or not.\n\
    Soft constraints are desirable but not necessary whereas hard constraints are\n\
    mandatory to be met. Constraints are put on the fitness function according to\n\
    application being considered. Covering this aspect is particularly important as\n\
    constraints are determined by the application being worked on.\n3\nMeheuristic\
    \ Algorithms\nMetaheuristic algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial\
    \ optimziation prob-\nlems in the real-world [249]. The aim of these algorithms\
    \ is to determine the minima\nor maxima of an objective function which translates\
    \ an optimization objective in to\none or more mathematical equations. Five algorithms\
    \ have been considered in this\nchapter, these are the Ant Colony Algorithm, Genetic\
    \ Algorithm, Particle Swarm Op-\ntimization Algorithm, Differential Evolution\
    \ and Artificial Bee Colony. As mentioned\nearlier, these have been chosen as\
    \ these were the most commonly used optimzation\nalgorithms identified by [249].\
    \ In this section, we provide a brief intuitive description\nfor each of them.\n\
    3.1\nAnt Colony Optimization\nAnt colony optimization is derived from the behavior\
    \ of ants searching for food\n[250]. It was observed that during this process,\
    \ each ant deposits a chemical called\npheromone on the path which it takes towards\
    \ the food. The more the ants take a\ngiven path, the more the pheromone is deposited\
    \ on it. Subsequent ants that want\nto go towards the food use the amount of pheromone\
    \ on a given path or sub-path\nto decide which path to take so as to determine\
    \ the optimal route to the food. In\nthe artificial ant colony optimization algorithm,\
    \ the points on the path that form the\nsub-paths are encoded on a graph where\
    \ each ant can only visit a given vertex (travel\non the same sub-path) once.\
    \ Each iteration starts with a number of artificial ants,\nan ant would choose\
    \ the next vertex to visit based on the level of pheromone on the\npossible sub-paths\
    \ available to it as well as whether that path has been used before.\nAt the end\
    \ of each iteration, the pheromone levels are updated so as to prioritize the\n\
    use of the most used path for ants in the next iteration.\n3.2\nGenetic Algorithm\n\
    A genetic algorithm [251] is based on evolutionary science. The idea behind the\
    \ ge-\nnetic algorithm is that starting from a given population set of organisms,\
    \ subsequent\n50\nreproduction will result in fitter organisms being produced\
    \ given that the organisms\nchosen for reproduction have some level of fitness.\
    \ To solve an optimization prob-\nlem, a genetic algorithm begins with a given\
    \ population size of strings also called\na chromosome. Each ‘chromosome’ consists\
    \ of a ‘gene’ which may represent points\nin the population. The sequence in which\
    \ the genes are present would represent a\nsolution to the problem. For e.g. for\
    \ a route scheduling problem, this may be the\ncoordinates of the stops. The ‘goodness’\
    \ of a chromosome is determined by a fitness\nfunction that quantifies how appropriate\
    \ a given chromosome is as a solution for the\nproblem. Choosing the right fitness\
    \ function is an important consideration in genetic\nalgorithms as it needs to\
    \ gauge the kind of optimization that is to be performed.\nThe optimization process\
    \ starts with an initial population of a given size. Once a fit-\nness function\
    \ has been defined, in each iteration, two or more chromosomes (parents)\nare\
    \ taken at random from the population and one or more offsprings are generated.\n\
    The random selection takes the selected parents fitness function value in to account,\n\
    however, its necessary that not all parents chosen are the fittest of the population\
    \ as\notherwise, diversity will be compromised, and the algorithm may get stuck\
    \ in a local\nminimum. The method by which these offspring are generated is called\
    \ the Crossover\nfunction and the number of parents mated to form offsprings from\
    \ them depends\non the crossover rate. The Crossover function defines the way\
    \ the genes within the\nchromosomes are exchanged. Usually, the crossover rate\
    \ has a high value. Moreover,\ndepending on some mutation rate, a given fraction\
    \ of all offsprings are mutated. Mu-\ntation depends on the mutation function\
    \ used and involves members of the offspring\nbeing swapped in some manner. When\
    \ one iteration of the offspring creation from\nthe parents in the entire population\
    \ is completed, the offsprings replace members of\nthe original population (typically\
    \ the weakest) and one generation of the GA is said\nto be completed. In order\
    \ to converge to a sufficiently good result, GA’s need to run\nfor many generations.\n\
    3.3\nParticle Swarm Optimization\nParticle Swarm Optimization is modeled on the\
    \ social behavior of animals rather than\nthe evolutionary biological behavior\
    \ on which Genetic Algorithms are based. PSO\n[252] is particularly based on the\
    \ behavior of a flock of birds searching for food. Each\nbird in the flock searches\
    \ for food and can communicate with other birds in the flock\nas soon as it finds\
    \ food or a good direction for it. Therefore, each bird has two food\n‘directions’\
    \ that it needs to consider, first is on an individual level which is called\n\
    the personal best and the second is on the flock level which is the global best.\
    \ Using\nthese two values the bird will proceed towards that path and will inform\
    \ other birds\nin the flock too. The idea here is that after enough time and with\
    \ all the individuals\nworking together, the swarm will find the place with the\
    \ highest concentration of\nfood. In terms of using PSO for optimization tasks,\
    \ individual birds are equivalent\nto a solution as in a GA and each is considered\
    \ as a point or a particle, collectively\nthey make up the swarm. This swarm population\
    \ may be initialized randomly or\nbased on some domain knowledge about the problem.\
    \ The highest concentration of\nfood represents the optimal solution for the whole\
    \ swarm where as a good direction\n51\nrepresents the local optimal solution for\
    \ each case. The aim here, like birds in a flock\nis to determine the global optimal\
    \ solution using information from each individual\nparticle. Each particle has\
    \ three aspects to it, its position, its velocity and a value of\nits current\
    \ position’s ’goodness’. This ’goodness’ as in the GA is defined by a fitness\n\
    function. Like birds, each particle has a personal best fitness value and is also\
    \ aware\nof the global best fitness value. For any particle, the new direction\
    \ of movement is\ndecided by a combination of the personal best and the global\
    \ best as well as the\nparticle’s intention to maintain its current movement.\
    \ Furthermore, several different\ntopologies can be utilized, and a neighborhood\
    \ can also be set for each particle to\nconvey positions when limiting the global\
    \ best parameter to the local best scheme\nrather than the whole swarm. The algorithm\
    \ may be stopped till the best solution is\nreached or no more improvement is\
    \ observed.\n3.4\nDifferential Evolution\nDifferential evolution [253] is a stochastic\
    \ evolutionary algorithm which is used for\noptimization problems for continuous\
    \ functions. The DE algorithm does not expect\ngradient information and thus it\
    \ doesn’t need to be differentiable. Like other evolu-\ntionary algorithms, a\
    \ solution is searched for in the design space by maintaining a\nset of individual\
    \ candidate solutions. In each iteration, the solutions with the best\nfitness\
    \ are combined together and retained for the next iteration. The aim is to im-\n\
    prove upon the fitness value and this process is repeated until a pre-decided\
    \ condition\nfor termination of this process is satisfied. Differential Evolution\
    \ is very similar to\nGenetic Algorithms in that both are evolutionary in nature,\
    \ however, the difference\nis that the DE uses real numbers in the chromosome\
    \ and also that the mutation oper-\nation consists of the difference between two\
    \ or more chromosomes of the population\nwith the possible addition of some type\
    \ of noise to create a new individual. Like\nGA, DE also suffer from getting stuck\
    \ in local minima. The DE algorithm also has\nthree control parameters, the population\
    \ size, the mutation factor and the crossover\nprobability.\n3.5\nArtificial Bee\
    \ Colony\nArticle Bee Colony [254] is a swarm intelligence algorithm based on\
    \ the behavior of\nbees. Within bees, there are different social classes who work\
    \ together to complete\ntasks such as harvesting pollen and nesting through the\
    \ use of smell, ’swing dance’\nand other methods. Bee colonies consist of three\
    \ types of bees, queen, male and\nthe worker bees which work on activities such\
    \ as searching for food, gathering and\nstorage of honey.\nAfter gathering honey,\
    \ the worker bee comes to the nest and\ninforms other bees about the location\
    \ of the honey source site through a dance. The\nABC algorithm simulates the behavior\
    \ of bees by considering three elements, the\nfood source, employed bees and unemployed\
    \ bees. The food source is represented as\nrevenue considering its distance and\
    \ quality, the higher the revenue, the better is the\nvalue. In computational\
    \ optimization terms, the food source is a potential solution\nto the objective\
    \ formulation of the considered problem and the quality or value of\n52\nthe food\
    \ source represents the fitness value of that particular solution. At the start,\n\
    all bees are used as scouts, searching for food sources. When a food source is\
    \ found,\nfor a high value food source, bees who find those food sources become\
    \ hire bees and\ncollect the food source. If the food source is of intermediate\
    \ value, the bees become\nfollow bees and if the food source value becomes low,\
    \ the bees become scout bees to\nlook for better food sources. Hire bees, the\
    \ bees with a food source location having\na high value, lead the follow bees\
    \ to develop solutions in their neighborhood in order\nto come up with more solutions.\
    \ A subset of the highest-ranking solutions are then\nconsidered before this process\
    \ is repeated again until the end conditions are met.\n4\nOptimization Applications\
    \ in Smart Cities\nSeveral tasks in smart city operations require the use of metheuristics\
    \ to be solved,\nthe aim being to optimize the resources present in the city.\
    \ This section presents\nthe different uses of optimization techniques for IoT\
    \ enabled Smart Cities.\nThis\ntask is performed for all eight components, Smart\
    \ Agriculture, Smart City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart\
    \ Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\nInfrastructure and Smart Transportation.\n4.1\n\
    Smart Agriculture\nSmart Agriculture involves the use of digital technologies\
    \ such as sensors and in-\ntelligent systems to improve agricultural productivity.\
    \ The sustenance of agriculture\ndepends on water, and it is central to the agricultural\
    \ production of food items around\nthe world. However, water is becoming an ever-scarce\
    \ resource due to the increasing\ndemand caused by human population growth, increased\
    \ economic activity by indus-\ntries and also due to climate change. It therefore\
    \ is necessary to utilize this precious\nresource wisely so as make use of it\
    \ in the best manner possible.\nOne approach\ntowards ensuring that water and\
    \ land is used appropriately is by introducing irriga-\ntion management schemes\
    \ such as irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the\nfarming process.\
    \ A summary of the optimization problems, objectives, constraints in\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and the use of IoT is illustrated in Figure 8.\nMeasurements in water irrigation\
    \ systems are typically performed by sensors\nplaced at different points in the\
    \ canals and rivers to determine water flow, volume and\nspeed. This information\
    \ regarding water movement can be combined with economic\ninformation such as\
    \ yeild, crop profit to optimize water distribution. Irrigation man-\nagement\
    \ through scheduling has been performed by the authors of [255, 256, 257, 258]\n\
    to maximize net return on crop profits, water use efficiency and to minimize leakage\n\
    losses. In [259] Fuqiang et al. aim to optimize water delivery through canals\
    \ while\nalso performing scheduling. They do this using a genetic algorithm and\
    \ work with\ntwo objectives, minimizing the difference between the time of water\
    \ delivery and wa-\nter demand and the fluctuation in water discharge of the main\
    \ canal. Their model\nwas applied to a district in China.\nThe authors in [260,\
    \ 261] work on optimal allocation of water. Of these, Ikudayisi\net al. [260]\
    \ use the differential evolution algorithm to minimize the water allocated to\n\

    \ terms of job creation, ensuring\nfood security and the yield of crops.\nWu et\
    \ al.\n[261] approach this as problem\nof reducing deviation between different\
    \ channels and minimizing water seepage to\nensure a more consistent supply to\
    \ all water channels. An approach presented by\nOcampo et al. [262] tackles this\
    \ problem not as a task of allocation directly but\nconsiders the scenario of\
    \ providing sufficient water to a smart farm while controlling\ntwo water pumps.\
    \ The objective function is formulated to minimize the energy cost\nof the water\
    \ pumps while maintaining sufficient supply of water to the plants on the\nfarms.\
    \ Constraints considered for such applications include the limited quantities\
    \ of\nwater being worked with, the time for which the water was available and\
    \ the area\nof land which was to be considered. Another allocation based scheme\
    \ is presented\nby Zhuo et al. [263] who use a genetic algorithm for an irrigation\
    \ system based on\na reservoir and two pumping stations. Their aim is to ensure\
    \ that there is no water\n54\nshortage. The objective function used by them is\
    \ the minimization of the annual sum\nof squared water shortage. Other work in\
    \ [264] also minimizes use of groundwater\nand increase benefit to the regional\
    \ water supply through reduction of water deficits\nin the Dujiangyan region of\
    \ China.\nA precision agriculture scheme is presented by Roy et al.\n[265] who\
    \ combine\nan IoT system consisting of sensors on plants using a GA based rainfall\
    \ predictor.\nCombining predicted rainfall information along with the sensed moisture\
    \ level in\nthe crops, they control plant watering. Lin et al. [266] propose a\
    \ framework for the\nmanagement of fertigation and irrigation in precision agriculture.\
    \ They perform short\nterm management and long-term management. Soil and crop\
    \ growth data is gathered\nfrom IoT based sensor systems. Long term planning refers\
    \ to the allocation of water\nand fertilizer resources to crops in terms of quantity\
    \ so as to meet demands whereas\nshort term refers to when and how to use them.\
    \ They use a genetic algorithm for long\nterm planning considering the allocation\
    \ of water and fertilizer for crops to maintain\npH value and electrical conductivity.\
    \ This information has been presented in Table\n16 while a summary of the identified\
    \ data sources used by each considered work has\nbeen provided in Table 17.\n\
    4.2\nSmart City Services\nAccording to the world bank, the amount of annual solid\
    \ waste generated is set to be\n3.40 billion tons [268] in 2050. Managing this\
    \ waste and its collection in an efficient\nmanner is imperative for health and\
    \ climate reaons. The most common application\ntowards smart city services optimization\
    \ is waste management as illustrated in Figure\n9 which summarizes the objectives,\
    \ constraints and the use of IoT.\nSmart waste collection systems include sensors\
    \ attached to trash cans which can\ninform the municipal authority about the status\
    \ of the garbage amount present in\nthem.\nOnce the trash cans are close to being\
    \ full, it is the responsibility of the\nmunicipal corporation to perform garbage\
    \ collection in an efficient manner. In this\nrespect, data provided by the sensors\
    \ on garbage cans can be used to determine\nan optimized route for garbage collection\
    \ to construct the Vehicle Routing Problem\n(VRP) in the Smart City Services domain.\
    \ As such, this problem has been performed\nkeeping in view various goals. The\
    \ minimization of the route distance taken by a\ngarbage tuck has been performed\
    \ by the authors in [269, 270, 271, 272, 273]. The\naim in this case is to determine\
    \ a route for garbage collection vehicles that minimizes\nthe total distance traveled\
    \ by the them. Zhang et al. [273] consider multi-vehicle\nallocation while considering\
    \ the single objective of minimizing route distance. Wei\net al. [274] use the\
    \ Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to determine garbage collection\nroutes resulting\
    \ in the minimum emission of CO2. Another optimization objective\nin route optimization\
    \ for waste management has been the minimization of the total\ntravel time, such\
    \ a target is described by the authors of [275, 276, 277, 278] who aim\nto reduce\
    \ travel time while considering emptying of waste bins. Another optimization\n\
    consideration in route optimization for waste management is to reduce cost. This\
    \ has\nbeen carried out by Tirkolaee et al. [279] who formulate a multi-objective\
    \ function of\ntravel cost and total useage cost of vehicles and determine the\
    \ route with the minimum\n55\nTable 16. Optimization in Smart Agriculture\nApplication\n\

    \ in\nSmart Grids has been illustrated in Figure 10.\nAn increasing population\
    \ has led to an increasing demand for electricity around\nthe world. This burdening\
    \ of the electricity grid has led to measures for increasing\nthe performance\
    \ of the electricity distribution system by reducing loss, prevent over-\nload\
    \ and reduce cost. The authors in [282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288] work on\n\
    the improvement of grid performance by minimizing cost and reducing power losses.\n\
    Power loss minimization is specifically targeted by [282, 286, 284]. Of these,\
    \ Ettappan\net al. [282] aim for the reduction of power losses, voltage deviation\
    \ and increasing\nvoltage stability. Atteya et al. [286] also address this problem\
    \ by considering net-\nwork redistribution to minimize losses in the grid whereas\
    \ Sakr et al. [284] focuses\non minimizing transfer losses in the smart grid to\
    \ accomplish this task. Nguyen and\nMohammadi [285] attempt the reduction of power\
    \ losses and line congestion by deter-\nmining the location of thyristor controlled\
    \ series compensator devices. The problem\nis formulated as a multi-objective\
    \ problem aiming to minimize loadability of the lines,\nactive power loss and\
    \ the reactance of the transmission line. A cost reduction-based\napproach to\
    \ improve grid performance is followed by Das et al. [283] who aim to\nreduce\
    \ cost of maintaining electrical stability and also the cost of management of\
    \ the\ndistribution network. They do this by considering changing the location\
    \ of energy\nstorage systems within the grid. Kanwar et al. [287] take maximizing\

    Distributed energy resource (DER) management is another area where optimiza-\n\
    tion algorithms are used in Smart Grids. The management of distributed energy\n\
    sources within smart grids is dependent on the interconnectivity provided by IoT\n\
    in the smart grid system.\nSmart meters within the smart grid provide real-time\n\
    information relating to power consumption which can be used for controlling DER\n\
    electricity. Moreover, IoT devices allow for switching loads and generation sources\
    \ as\nrequired. This assists in creating a virtual power plant to aggregate all\
    \ energy sources\nin a DER scenario. With global warming and a changing climate,\
    \ utilities around\nthe world are increasingly incorporating various renewable\
    \ energy sources within their\ngrid which often times are an economically convenient\
    \ option as well. However, many\n59\nof these sources such as wind and solar (photo\
    \ voltaic [PV]) do not offer a consistent\nsupply of power throughout the day.\
    \ In this regard, systems such as batteries as\nwell as conventional generation\
    \ plants need to be used together along with renewable\nenergy sources. For utility\
    \ companies, it is necessary to optimize power production\nso that the maximum\
    \ amount of energy is utilized from these renewable sources so\nas to reduce cost\
    \ to the user while also maintaining the quality of service. The au-\nthors in\
    \ [289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302] provide\n\
    a management scheme for DERs to minimize cost. In this regard, the authors in\n\
    [292, 293, 294, 297, 289, 290, 300, 301, 302] all formulate the problem of distributed\n\
    energy resource management as a single objective problem where the cost incurred\
    \ is\nminimized. On the other hand, the authors in [298, 295, 291] and [299] formulate\
    \ this\nas a multi-objective problem. Azaza and Wallin [299] not only target reduction\
    \ of\nelectricity production cost but also maximize reliability of the system\
    \ while reducing\nthe environmental impact of the distribution system. It is interesting\
    \ to note that the\nimprovement of system reliability is formulated as a minimization\
    \ problem as well.\nSimilarly, Das et, al. [291] consider the reduction of both\
    \ the total cost as well as\nthe environmental cost of the system. Their considered\
    \ scenario also consists of a\nPV, Wind Turbine and battery. The constraints considered\
    \ were constraints regard-\ning power flow, limitations on power and voltage values,\
    \ power balance constraint\nand power generation constraints on the renewable\
    \ energy sources. In [289, 302], a\nDER management system is developed for a microgrid\
    \ which consists of a controllable\ncollection of energy storage and generation\
    \ sources powered by IoT devices.\nPlanning in distribution networks has been\
    \ considered by the work of [303] and\n[304]. Mahdavi et al. [303] work on expanding\
    \ transmission lines utilizing the artificial\nbee colony algorithm to minimize\
    \ cost of network expansion, power losses in load\nand generation. On the other\
    \ hand, Maji and Acharjee [304] aim to determine the\nminimum number of Phase\
    \ Measurement Units (PMUs) to make the distribution\nnetwork observable. The constraints\
    \ used were power flow and balance of power as\nwell as limits on the number of\
    \ transmission lines available. The internet of things also\nfinds usefulness\
    \ in terms of the use of Phase Measurement Units that provide voltage\nand current\
    \ measurement capabilities within smart grids to perform maintenance and\nmonitoring\
    \ operations. A summary of this discussion has been provided in Table 20\nand\
    \ the data setups used by the covered research work is presented in Table 21.\n\

    ambulance dispatch increases mortality [307], moreover, economically speaking,\
    \ a\none-minute delay in response time for cardiac patients found that the mortality\
    \ in-\ncreases by 1% and adds annual costs of USD 7 billion in healthcare expenditure\n\
    [308]. Keeping this in mind ambulance deployment and location determination have\n\
    been of considerable interest in the area of optimization for smart health. These\n\
    two problems are specific cases of the Vehicle Routing Problem [309] and Maximum\n\
    coverage problem [310] sometimes called the Ambulance Routing Problem [311] and\n\
    Ambulance Location Problem [312]. The authors in [313] work on the optimal allo-\n\
    62\ncation determination based on fixed sites and a finite number of ambulances\
    \ while\nminimizing lateness of ambulance arrival using the Ant Colony Optimization.\
    \ Later\non, in their work in [314], they do a comparison with using GAs and find\
    \ that GAs\nprovide better performance. Kochetov and Shamray [315] attempt localization\
    \ of\nambulance fleet at base stations with the aim to minimize the average waiting\
    \ time\nfor arrival of ambulances. An interesting approach to this problem is\
    \ presented in\nYan et al. [316] who work on this problem from a scheduling perspective\
    \ where they\ncontrol scheduling of emergency vehicles to reduce the total cost\
    \ in terms of money\nand time using a Genetic Algorithm. Another approach for\
    \ sequencing vehicles to\nensure emergency vehicles reach their destination in\
    \ time is presented by Lu et al.\n[317] who aim to prioritize emergency vehicle\
    \ thoroughfare on traffic intersections.\nThey do this by minimizing the entrance\
    \ time of the vehicle by manipulating vehicle\norder. Constraints used for these\
    \ problems include constraints on the speed of the\nambulances, the flow of vehicles\
    \ on the road, specific road connections present as well\nas time constraints.\
    \ The internet of things serves a pivotal role in enabling the allo-\ncation and\
    \ routing of emergency vehicles. The connectivity provided by IoT through\nvehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication as well as vehicle to infrastructure communication\nfacilitates\
    \ providing a real-time indication of the vehicle’s location as well as the con-\n\
    dition of traffic in a given area. This information can then be used to determine\
    \ an\noptimal route for emergency vehicles as well as for their optimal deployment\
    \ to serve\npeople in need. Information about optimization methods for smart health\

    \ energy management has been the prime application of optimization in smart\n\
    homes, a summary of the objectives, constraints and the use of IoT has been shown\n\
    in Figure 12.\nSmart Homes \nHome Energy Management \nAppliance\nScheduling \n\

    \ as temperature etc for comfort determination in homes, smart meters\nprovide\
    \ interconnectivity betwen homes\nFigure 12. Optimization applications in Smart\
    \ Homes.\n64\nHome energy management refers to the development of demand side\
    \ manage-\nment schemes that aim to reduce the electricity cost billed to a customer\
    \ or maintain\ncomfort for the user. One way this is performed is by appropriate\
    \ appliance schedul-\ning. The idea here is to schedule the usage of appliances\
    \ in such a way that the\nmost power-hungry devices are turned on during off peak\
    \ hours when electricity costs\nmight be lower. The combination of the Smart Grid\
    \ and Smart Homes facilitates the\ndevelopment of optimization schemes that not\
    \ only benefit the customer (in terms\nof reduced electricity costs and maintaining\
    \ comfort) but also be useful for the util-\nities in ensuring that load profiles\
    \ (though minimizing the peak to average ratio)\nare more consistent thereby allowing\
    \ better planning of the power generation mix\nused by them. The authors of [319]\
    \ perform appliance scheduling for the purpose of\nminimizing electricity cost\
    \ and the waiting time for appliance usage. Interestingly,\nthey incorporate comfort\
    \ maintenance by adding it as a constraint. A similar ap-\nproach has been followed\
    \ by Bui et al [320] and Makhadmeh et al. [321] who aim to\nminimize the cost\
    \ of electricity usage with a constraint for maintenance of comfort.\nMakhadmeh\
    \ et al. [321] also include the reduction of waiting time rate for appliances\n\
    by the user and the reduction of the peak to average ratio of the power consumed\
    \ as\nconstraints. The authors in [322, 323, 324, 325] perform appliance scheduling\
    \ while\nconsidering electricity cost and peak to average ratio which need to\
    \ be minimized.\nAll of the authors present a multi-objective function for this\
    \ purpose combining the\nobjectives of minimizing the cost and the peak to average\
    \ power ratio. Azimi et al.\n[326] combine the problem of reducing cost and power\
    \ together as a single objective\nby considering the minimization of the ratio\
    \ of operating cost and load factor in a\nbattery supported system. The works\
    \ of [327, 328, 329, 330, 331] also consider user\ncomfort as part of the objective.\
    \ In [327], Essiet and Wang form a multi-objective\nminimization problem of electricity\
    \ cost, peak to average ratio for power and discom-\nfort of users in a smart\
    \ home supported by a renewable energy system consisting of a\nbattery and PV\
    \ system. In Chanra et al. [332], the authors aim to reduce electricity\ncost\
    \ by appliance scheduling in such a manner so as to make as much use of onsite\n\
    energy units as possible so as to reduce usage of utility provided electricity.\
    \ The\nenergy units they consider are a diesel generator, renewables and battery.\
    \ Another\napproach that aims to reduce cost of consumed electricity is presented\
    \ by Faia et\nal. [333] who formulate it as a problem of minimizing the energy\
    \ bill and the cost\nassociated with curtailment of power in a system with a battery\
    \ and a photovoltaic\nsystem. Work in [334, 330, 335, 336] also perform appliance\
    \ scheduling to reduce\ncost of electricity. Appliance scheduling for smart homes\
    \ has also been performed by\nFatima et al. [323] and Abid et al. [322] considering\
    \ a microgrid for homes where\ninstead of optimizing data from single homes, the\
    \ authors used data from connected\nsmart meters to determine an optimized control\
    \ scheme for appliances across the grid.\nThe constraints used for optimization\
    \ in smart homes are on the comfort needing to\nbe maintained, constraints on\
    \ the powerflow, time of operation, the maximum power\nthat is present or used\
    \ and which appliances are switchable appliances. Appliance\nscheduling is based\
    \ on smart meters as well as individual control and monitoring of\nappliances\
    \ using IoT systems. IoT devices enable the microgrid which is used to\ngather\
    \ data as well as control the switching on and off of sources from the houses\n\
    65\nelectricty supply. The information gathered from these IoT units can be processed\n\
    to optimize energy consumption patterns to reduce cost to the customer as well\
    \ as\nincrease comfort. The use of the considered optimization schemes for smart\
    \ homes\nhas been presented in Table 24 with the data setups presented in Table\
    \ 25.\n4.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the biggest enablers of the Industry 4.0 concept\
    \ has been the use of AI tech-\nniques to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing\
    \ and production process. This\nhas led to the development of cyber physical systems\
    \ aiming to assist in activity recog-\nnition [339], machine health prediction\
    \ [340] and production management in terms of\nbottleneck prediction [341]. Apart\
    \ from conventional AI applications of anomaly de-\ntection, classification and\
    \ regression, computational optimization also finds numerous\napplications as\
    \ it fits well with the objective of efficient and streamlined manufac-\nturing.\
    \ The major applications for the use of computational optimization have been\n\
    in the area of routing and location for logistics and are variations of the vehicle\n\
    routing problem and are typically represented as Multidepot Vehicle Routing Prob-\n\
    lem (MVRP), Vehicle Routing Problem Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows\n(VRPPDTW)\
    \ or Large-scale Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (LSDVRP). Figure\n13 summarizes\
    \ the objectives utilized, constraints and the role of IoT in optimization\nfor\
    \ Smart Industry.\nThe authors in [342] and [343] use the ABC and the GA respectively\
    \ to determine\nthe best location of service sites for logistic operations. Both\
    \ these approaches use\nmulti-objective formulations aiming to reduce cost of\
    \ operations, transportation as\nwell as the establishment of the centers. The\
    \ authors in Su et al. [344] use ACO,\nAlinaghia et al. [345] PSO and Utama et\
    \ al. [346] use ABC to address the problem\nof determining the best route for\
    \ logistics operations.\nThe routing and coverage\nproblem for logistics involves\
    \ determining the best route for either a single or multiple\nvehicles at a depot\
    \ which have to visit every customer. The works of [344, 345, 346]\nfocus on reducing\
    \ the cost incurred in the routing for vehicles in logistics as a single\nobjective\
    \ formulation. On the other hand, the authors of [347, 348] and [349] all\nwork\
    \ on the minimization of distance as their objective in determining the optimal\n\
    route for delivery vehicles trying to serve multiple locations.\nMounia and Bachir\n\
    [348] address routing in logistics as a multi-objective problem where they not\
    \ only\naim to minimize the distance traveled by the vehicles but also aim to\
    \ reduce CO2\nemissions and the number of vehicles used. A time based optimization\
    \ approach is\npresented by the authors of [350] and [351] with [350] also factoring\
    \ in reduction of fuel\nconsumption in their objective function formulation. Constraints\
    \ used for the routing\nand location determination problem are related to time,\
    \ capacity constraints for the\nvehicles, each customer being served only once,\
    \ constraints related to the route. The\ndetermination of the location and the\
    \ route for vehicles is dependent on real time\ninformation concerning the traffic\
    \ in the area as well as the loads to be collected from\neach site in addition\
    \ to other information which can be provided by IoT units. The\nusage of optimization\

    Smart Infrastructure\nWithin the infrastructure domain, the most common optimization\
    \ problem is the\narea of health monitoring of structures. Structural Health Monitoring\
    \ (SHM) is a\nnecessary application within the smart infrastructure domain as\
    \ it makes for safe\nusage of different structures of public use.\nThese structures\
    \ can be buildings as\nwell as transport structures such as bridges, tunnels.\
    \ Structural health monitoring\ntypically involves the use of sensors attached\
    \ to a structure at several points that can\ngauge some type of physical variable\
    \ (vibration, strain, acceleration, temperature,\ntilt etc) from the structure.\n\
    Data gathered from these connected sensors is then\nused to determine if any structural\
    \ damage has taken place or not.\nWithin the\ndomain of SHM, optimization algorithms\
    \ find application towards the Optimal Sensor\n69\nTable 27. Data setup for Smart\

    For the optimal sensor placement problem, the aim is to determine the best num-\n\
    ber and placement of sensors over a structure so as to reduce the number of sensors\n\
    used as well as improve the measurement process, both these aims result in increased\n\
    reliability of the SHM system as well as potentially lower the cost of the system\n\
    too. The authors in [353, 354, 355, 356, 357] work on the placement of sensors\
    \ for\nstructural health monitoring focusing on improving the effectiveness of\
    \ the deployed\nsystem. In this regard, [353] and [356] use the genetic algorithm\
    \ to solve a multi-\nobjective problem aiming to minimize the measurement error\
    \ and cost. Yang et al.\nin [355] formulate OSP as single objective minimization\
    \ where they aim to reduce\nthe ratio of sensor placement performance to the redundancy\
    \ of information resulting\nfrom each tested placement. Another approach that\
    \ works on the error is presented\nby [354] who use the Particle Swarm Optimization\

    \ It must be noted that the objective function is for-\nmulated as minimization\
    \ of negated accuracy and negated robustness measurement.\nOptimized structural\
    \ health monitoring for aircraft monitoring has been targeted\nin [358]. In their\
    \ setup consisting of vibration sensors, the authors optimize sensor\nplacement\
    \ by minimizing the cross correlation of the vibration waves in the sensing\n\
    network. The most common constraint for sensor placement is restrictions on the\n\
    places where sensors can be placed. This information has been provided in Table\
    \ 28\nand the data setups are presented in 29.\n4.8\nSmart Transportation\nOne\
    \ of the most popular optimization applications within smart cities are within\
    \ the\nsmart transport domain. These include parking system routing, traffic signal\
    \ control\nand scheduling. A summary of the applications, their objectives, constraints\
    \ and the\nrole of IoT is illustrated in Figure 15.\n71\nSmart TransportaƟon \n\

    Smart transport systems consist of sensors along roads and traffic intersections\n\
    to measure relevant parameters while also providing communication services between\n\
    vehicles and infrastructure. This allows for measurement of the current state\
    \ of roads\nin terms of traffic congestion and usage thereby allowing for the\
    \ use of optimization\ntechniques to improve trip experiences for users and make\
    \ the transportation system\nmore efficient. The authors in [361, 362, 363, 364,\
    \ 365] work on the minimization\nof time (wait and travel) in traffic signal control.\
    \ The aim of such systems is to\nreduce traffic build up on signal intersections.\
    \ Of these, the work in [361, 362] and\n[363] use the artificial bee colony and\
    \ the genetic algorithm respectively for a single\nobjective function of minimizing\
    \ delay time. An interesting approach for this problem\nis presented by Li et\
    \ al. [365] who use a multi objective formulation targeting the\nminimization\
    \ of the average travel time both overall and individually for all vehiclesl.\n\
    Another multi-objective approach in traffic signal control is presented by Chen\
    \ and\nYuan [366] who form a mixed problem of minimizing vehicle emissions and\
    \ travel\ntime together. Korkmaz [367] work on the estimation of delays in traffic\
    \ signals using\na genetic algorithm, they use it to minimize the difference between\
    \ the estimated\n72\nand simulated values.\nTang et al.\n[364] carry out distributed\
    \ optimization in a\nfog and cloud hierarchy.\nFirst, fog nodes optimize phase\
    \ timings within a single\ncycle and if the number of vehicles exceeds a threshold,\
    \ the results are sent to the\ncentral controller to further optimize over different\
    \ cycles so that a traffic jam is\navoided or alleviated. Zhang et al. [368] attempt\
    \ traffic signal optimization using\nmulti objective optimization functions of\
    \ reducing time delay and increasing traffic\ncapacity.\nConstraints used for\
    \ traffic signal control are timing constraints on the\nphase durations, flow\
    \ rate of vehicles and on the travel time.\nTraffic routing is also another important\
    \ aspect in smart transportation. This\ntypically involves the determination of\
    \ the best route to the destination keeping in\nview various criteria such as\
    \ reduction of distance, time, cost etc.\nThe problem\nof traffic routing is addressed\
    \ by the works of [369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375,\n376, 377, 378, 379]. The\
    \ authors in [369] and [370] use the ant colony optimization\nand genetic algorithm\
    \ to minimize the travel distance in parking system routing.\nThey aim to minimize\
    \ distance traveled by a driver looking to find a free parking\nspot, using the\
    \ algorithm, an optimized route is determined for the parking spot.\nIn, [371,\
    \ 373] and [372] the ant colony optimization algorithm is used to determine\n\
    the best route in a generic traffic scenario where cars can communicate with road\n\
    side units in a VANET architecture. Routing for public transport is performed\
    \ by\n[380] and [375] in a connected vehicle scenario aiming to minimize travel\
    \ time. An\neconomic objective approach to traffic routing is taken by the authors\
    \ of [376, 378]\nand [379] who minimize the total cost of the trip.\nMao [379]\
    \ also include traffic\ncongestion and travel time as well in their computation.\
    \ Hassoune et al. [381] work\non a parking guidance using the ant colony optimization\
    \ algorithm to reduce traffic\ncongestion and minimize distance. Constraints for\
    \ traffic routing are related to the\nroad network allowing travel in specific\
    \ directions, signaling and travel time. Within\nsmart transportation, IoT nodes\
    \ are used to determine occupied parking spaces and\nthis data is used for routing\
    \ applications in parking. Traffic routing is based on vehicle\nto vehicle and\
    \ vehicle to infrastructure communication provided by VANETs within\nthe IoT framework.\
    \ These systems enable cars to exchange data with each other and\nalso with fixed\
    \ infrastructure on the roads. This discussion is also presented in Table\n30\
    \ and the data setups for the covered work are presented in Table 31.\n5\nConclusion\n\
    This chapter provides coverage of the application of five popular computational\
    \ algo-\nrithms in the IoT enabled Smart City. It provides a mapping of the various\
    \ applica-\ntions to the specific smart city domain as well as highlights the\

    As discussed earlier, IoT finds usage in many different Smart City domains, both\
    \ for\nuse in classification/regression tasks as well as for optimization applications.\
    \ One\nof the most important applications of IoT within Smart Cities is within\
    \ the Smart\nHealth domain wherein IoT devices enable the monitoring of patients\
    \ for different\ndiseases such as heart disease etc. While there are a multitude\
    \ of IoT within Smart\nHealth, in order to develop algorithms on IoT sensor data,\
    \ the case of ambient assisted\nliving was chosen, in particular, this work considers\
    \ the case of fall detection.\n2\nIoT for Fall Detection\nThe United Nations estimates\
    \ that the number of old people (aged 60 and above) will\nbe 2.1 billion by 2050\
    \ and 3.1 billion by 2100 [382] leading to an increased old age\npopulation. With\
    \ people above 65 years suffering the greatest number of fatal falls\namong adults\
    \ aged 60 and over [383] healthcare costs related to fall related injuries\nrun\
    \ in to billions of dollars. These falls can result in injuries of moderate to\
    \ severe\nnature in the people experiencing the falls and may lead to decreased\
    \ mobility [384],\nespecially for the elderly [385]. Furthermore, following the\
    \ initial fall, the likelihood\nof experiencing additional falls increases [386]\
    \ and can lead to mental stress in the\nform of post-fall syndrome [387].\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things has spearheaded the development of cyber-physical systems\n\
    that facilitate the recognition of activities/events being performed by people\
    \ in their\ndaily life. One aspect of this application scenario is fall detection.\
    \ Falls can occur\ndue to a variety of reasons [388] and Fall Detection Systems\
    \ (FDS) are used for\npeople with different of health related ailments such as\
    \ in Parkinsons disease [389],\nepilepsy [390], arthritis, people suffering from\
    \ cardiovascular diseases and various\nneuro-degenerative diseases [391]. In any\
    \ scenario, it is pertinent that when a person\nundergoes a fall, they be provided\
    \ care as quickly as possible. Providing timely care\nafter a fall may improve\
    \ post-fall life quality of a patient. Fall detection Systems can\nplay a vital\
    \ role in contributing to the provision of timely care [389, 392] by alerting\n\
    healthcare professionals. As noted by [393] fall detection systems are necessary\
    \ for\nold people with cognitive impairments who may not be able to get up after\
    \ a fall for\nlong durations of time which may result in pressure sores and other\
    \ complications\nand due to vulnerability to injuries when experiencing a fall,\
    \ it may sometimes result\nin death [394].\n76\nA fall is an unintended and sudden\
    \ change of posture resulting in one resting on\nthe ground or some other lower\
    \ level elevation. The aim of a FDS is to monitor the\nmovement of a person and\
    \ determine when a fall has taken place with the aim to\nalert healthcare personnel\
    \ or other caregivers. Over the years different methodologies\nhave been suggested\
    \ to address this problem, however, before discussing the different\nmethods utilize\
    \ for fall detection purposes, it is important to mention what researchers\nenumerate\
    \ to be the traits of a ’good’ FDS [395].\n2.1\nChallenges/Requirements of a FDS\n\
    The following are the typical typical traits/requirements of a good fall detection\n\
    system.\n2.1.1\nNon-intrusiveness\nAn important requirement in fall detection\
    \ systems is to be non-intrusive. Any FDS\nshould not be an impediment in the\
    \ execution of daily activities of a person as it may\nrestrict movement or inconvenience\
    \ their lifestyle.\n2.1.2\nLow Latency\nAn FDS needs to be able to detect a fall\
    \ with low latency. Latency refers to the time\nduration between the occurring\
    \ of a fall and its detection. FDS need to detect falls\nas quickly as possible\
    \ to ensure that caregivers can be notified right away so that apt\ncare is provided\
    \ to the person. Low latency depends on not only the algorithm being\nused to\
    \ detect falls but also parameters like network speed and reliability. Sensor\
    \ data\ntransmission to the main system might also be included in this calculation\
    \ depending\non the FDS proposed.\n2.1.3\nLow power consumption\nPower consumption\
    \ is an important issue in FDS, especially for ones which are battery\npowered.\
    \ Many FDS are expected to be used by elderly people who might not be\nas regular\
    \ in charging the FDS, therefore FDS should consume as little power as\npossible.\n\
    2.1.4\nAllow mobility\nA FDS should not hamper mobility as it might be preventive\
    \ in adoption of a FDS\ntoo. FDS which require people to remain infront of a camera\
    \ at a certain viewpoint\netc can be difficult to deploy and use.\n2.1.5\nDifferentiate\
    \ between Falls and Activities\nA FDS should have low false positives and false\
    \ negatives. In other words it should\nbe able to confidently detect falls and\
    \ be able to differentiate them from activities of\n77\ndaily living such as walking,\
    \ sitting, jumping, running etc. Any false alarms will result\nin wastage of valuable\
    \ healthcare resources, on the contrary, any false negatives might\ncause the\
    \ patient/person having undergone the fall to not get appropriate medical\ncare\
    \ in time and lead to potential death or trauma.\n2.1.6\nNotify caregivers\nA\
    \ complete fall detection solution should have some mechanism of informing care-\n\
    givers whenever a fall is detected. Typically this is carried out in terms of\
    \ email,\nnotifications via some system or messages. Moreover, this process should\
    \ be quick so\nas to ensure the dispatch of any needed help as quickly as possible.\n\
    2.1.7\nTrack history\nA complete fall detection solution should be able to provide\
    \ the history about a\npatient in terms of falls that a person may have suffered\
    \ from as this will help monitor\nthe patients health and determine likelihood\
    \ to suffer from falls in the future. FDS\nmay sometimes also look at other biological\
    \ parameters during falls so as to help\ninvestigate the causes of falls using\
    \ the conditions prevalent at that time. Biological\nparameters that could be\
    \ measured include heart rate, perhaps an ECG or others as\ndeemed necessary based\
    \ on a patients history.\n2.2\nTypes of Fall Detection Systems\nFall detection\
    \ systems can be categorized in to three types based on the sensing\nmechanisms\
    \ used and their placement. These are Ambient Sensor based systems,\nVisual based\
    \ systems and Wearable Sensor based systems.\n2.2.1\nAmbient Sensor based systems\n\
    Ambient sensor based systems are also sometimes referred to as environmental sensor\n\
    based systems since these types of FDS rely on the use of a number of wirelessly\n\
    connected ambient sensors placed in a given area for the detection of falls. These\n\
    FDS make use of various sensors including Passive InfraRed (PIR) Sensors [396],\n\
    Acoustic sensors such as microphones, thermal sensors as well as sensors measuring\n\
    Wi-Fi signal strength etc. For e.g., the authors in [397] develop a fall detection\
    \ system\nbased on two PIR sensors and a vibration sensor to detect vibrations\
    \ on the floor\nwhen a person falls down. Using the PIR sensor to detect a persons\
    \ motion. feature\nextraction is performed on vibration measurements and an SVM\
    \ classifier is used to\ndetermine whether a fall has taken place or not. Another\
    \ approach presented in [398]\nutilize sounds in a home to determine falls in\
    \ the elderly. They do this by extracting\nfeatures in sound signals and like\
    \ [397] use a Support Vector Machine classifier to\ndetermine falls. The authors\
    \ in [399] make use of Wi-Fi channel state information\nfor fall detection. They\
    \ achieve this by feature extraction in the frequency domain\nfollowed by an SVM\
    \ classifier.\n78\nAmbient fall detection systems offer the advantage of not requiring\
    \ people to wear\nanything on their bodies and are thus nonrestrictive in that\
    \ sense. However, such\nsystems are prone to suffer high false positives due to\
    \ the large number of external\nfactors such as other heat emitting devices, multiple\
    \ people moving around at the\nsame time etc. Another issue that comes with ambient\
    \ fall detection systems is that\ndeployment could be cumbersome to cover a large\
    \ space, therefore they are typically\ndeployable in small places such as a home\
    \ or a small building but are very difficult\nto use outdoors due to the nature\
    \ of the setting as well as the possible sources of\nexternal interference.\n\
    2.2.2\nVision based systems\nVision based systems rely on the processing of video\
    \ frames or other visual infor-\nmation such as depth and thermal images or their\
    \ combination [400] to detect falls.\nTypically, the recorded data is sent to\
    \ a server or central computer which provides\nprocessing capabilities. Moreover,\
    \ recently, with the use of deep learning algorithms,\nsuch systems have found\
    \ to provide improved performance. For e.g. [401] use Convo-\nlution Neural Networks\
    \ on velocity information in video frames. Another approach\nthat uses CNNs is\
    \ given in [402] who model human motion from video frames using\nCNNs and then\
    \ use a logistic regression classifier to determine falls. Other approaches\n\
    with CNNs include the works in [403] and [404], both of which achieve very high\
    \ de-\ntection accuracy. Another DL network which has been useful in fall detection\
    \ systems\nbased on cameras is Long Short Term Machine, a recent example of that\
    \ is the use of\na CNN + LSTM combination on 360 degree video recordings of an\
    \ indoor facility to\ndetermine falls. The LSTM allows for capturing the changing\
    \ characteristics between\nvideo frames to provide fall recognition.\nEventhough\
    \ vision based FDS have been able to provide improved fall detection\nperformance\
    \ recently, like ambient sensor based systems, these systems suffer from\nsome\
    \ drawbacks. They are affected negatively in terms of performance and deploya-\n\
    bility from external factors such as occlusion, restricted mobility of the people\
    \ being\nmonitored, typically usable in environments over a small area, have high\
    \ computa-\ntional costs and are expensive. One other issue with vision based\
    \ systems is privacy,\nvision systems which use normal cameras pose risk of violation\
    \ to the privacy of peo-\nple being captured on video. The question of privacy\
    \ can be circumvented by the\nuse of depth cameras for e.g. a kinect [405, 406]\
    \ or using heatmaps using infrared\ncameras/sensors [407].\n2.2.3\nWearable Sensor\
    \ based systems\nWearable fall detection systems involve the use of a device attached\
    \ to the subject.\nThe wearable device monitors user activity by means of sensors\
    \ and can determine\nwhen a fall has occurred. Information about the fall is then\
    \ conveyed to a doctor or\nother medical professionals. Various types of sensors\
    \ can be used in these systems\nincluding inertial measurement sensors such as\
    \ accelerometers, gyroscopes, magne-\ntometers [408] or health sensors such as\
    \ ECGs, oxygen level and pulse rate sensors\n79\nas well. The devices that contain\
    \ these sensors can be worn on the hand, wrist, arm,\nchest, waist, legs, thigh\
    \ or even put inside shoes and are usually battery powered.\nWearable fall detection\
    \ systems have the advantage that they do not restrict move-\nment of the person\
    \ using them and consume less power than the other two approaches,\nhowever, a\
    \ disadvantage to this is the need to ’carry’ the device all the time. Another\n\
    disadvantage is the need to charge the device regularly which might be difficult\
    \ to do\nfor older people, a way this has been addressed in some approaches is\
    \ to make use of\nenergy harvesting [409].\n2.3\nTypes of Wearable FDS\nThere\
    \ are two types of wearable systems in use for fall detection purposes.\n2.3.1\n\
    Threshold based systems\nThe first of type of wearable FDS are threshold-based\
    \ fall detection systems where\nauthors have used various thresholding techniques\
    \ on sensor values measuring motion,\nparticularly the accelerometer. The major\
    \ advantage of threshold based fall detection\nsystems is their relative low computational\
    \ cost and use of sensor fusion techniques\nto improve fall detection accuracy\
    \ , however, the big disadvantage of such systems is\nthat threshold based systems\
    \ do not generalize well across subjects since people may\nhave different gaits,\
    \ this is especially true for people of different ages. As a result,\nthreshold\
    \ based FDS may suffer from having many false positives as well as false\nnegatives\
    \ since the FDS needs to differentiate between activities of daily living and\n\
    falls, which many times may appear to be fairly similar to each other in terms\
    \ of\nsensor readings.\n2.3.2\nMachine/Deep Learning based systems\nSince threshold-based\
    \ systems are rigid in terms of their usage, ML/DL methods\nprovide a flexible\
    \ method for fall detection. ML/DL algorithms can learn complex\npatterns from\
    \ sensor data which indicate to a fall while monitoring a persons activities\n\
    and therefore are useful in fall detection systems. As opposed to threshold based\n\
    systems, their generalizing capability allows them to be used across subjects.\n\
    A\ntypical ML framework for fall detection will involve data acquisition, prepossessing,\n\
    feature extraction and then usage of a suitable ML algorithm to make the inference\n\
    for a fall or no fall. A deep learning framework based FDS might have a similar\n\
    methodology, but depending on the DL algorithm used, feature extraction might\
    \ be\nomitted.\n2.4\nSensors used in Wearable FDS\nAs mentioned before, the sensors\
    \ used in wearable FDS are accelerometers, gyroscope,\nmagnetometer, ECG, Pulse\
    \ Rate and oxygen saturation levels. In this section, we will\ndiscuss briefly\
    \ the role of these sensors in wearable FDS and parameters of interest\nwhen using\
    \ them in FDS.\n80\n2.4.1\nAccelerometers\nAccelerometers, together with gyroscopes\
    \ are the most widely used sensors in wear-\nable FDS. One reason for this is\
    \ that both these sensors are typically present in\nsmartphones, which have been\
    \ used to either collect data for and/or deploy fall de-\ntection systems. An\
    \ accelerometer provides a measure of absolute acceleration and\nare used to detect\
    \ vibrations, force in a variety of applications involving monitoring\nof machines,\
    \ planes, civil architectures and more. In an FDS, an accelerometer is\nable to\
    \ capture the movement patterns of individuals which can be used to determine\n\
    falls.\n2.4.2\nGryroscope\nGyroscopes are used to measure tilt/orientation.\n\
    Gyroscopes find applications in\nvarious areas where orientation measurement is\
    \ required, for e.g. in airplanes and\nsubmarines where they are used in stabilization\
    \ systems, smartphones and game re-\nmotes for interactive gameplay, among other\
    \ things. Since orientation is an important\ncharacteristic of a fall, gyroscopes\
    \ are one of the most widely used sensors in FDS\nalong with acceleratorometers.\n\
    2.4.3\nMagnetometer\nA magnetometer is a device that measures the direction and\
    \ strength of magnetism\nrelative to the earths magnetic north. In addition to\
    \ other applications, magnetome-\nters are used in aircrafts for direction referencing.\
    \ These sensors are not very popular\nin FDS but have been proposed in some approaches\
    \ [410, 411] to be used for fall\ndetection in addition to accelerometers and/or\
    \ gyroscopes.\n2.4.4\nVarious Medical Sensors\nWearable fall detection systems\
    \ may also incorporate different types of medical sen-\nsors such as ElectroCardioGraphs,\
    \ ElectroMyoGraphs, Pulse Rate or Oxygen Level\nmeasurement in the FDS solution.\
    \ Even though there have been some approaches\nwhich have used medical sensors\
    \ exclusively for fall detection (such as EMG[412]),\nhowever, like magnetometers,\
    \ these sensors are usually used along with accelerome-\nters and/or gyroscopes.\
    \ Adding these sensors to fall detection systems has the added\nadvantage of assessing\
    \ falls from a health standpoint too as this information can be\nused to determine\
    \ risk of falls [413].\n2.5\nDesign considerations for Wearable FDS\nWearable\
    \ fall detection systems utilize sensor measurements to ascertain the occur-\n\
    rence of a fall. Since wearable FDS units are always attached to a persons body,\
    \ they\ncontinuously provide measurements of a persons movements and activities.\
    \ In order\nto use these measurements in a FDS, there are some design considerations\
    \ involved.\nWe discuss them in this section.\n81\n2.5.1\nSampling frequency\n\
    The sampling frequency dictates the number of sensor measurements recorded per\n\
    second. The sampling frequency used in an FDS should be high enough to capture\n\
    fall motion but not too high so as to increase data processing, storage requirements\n\
    as well as allow for energy efficient operation. In fact, depending on the position\n\
    of the sensors, significant reductions can be made in the sampling frequency used\n\
    for sensors with little or no change in performance as demonstrated by [414].\
    \ Such\nreductions could result in low power consumption by the wearable module\
    \ thereby\nenabling longevity of operation.\n2.5.2\nWindowing\nSince wearable\
    \ fall detection systems provide a continuous stream of sensor data, the\ndata\
    \ needs to be windowed for fall detection to be performed. Windowing refers to\
    \ the\nextraction of a subset of the sensor data stream in a sliding manner or\
    \ otherwise and\nis typically specified in terms of time duration for its size.\
    \ It is typical for wearable\nFDS designers to test different window sizes for\
    \ their fall detection algorithms. The\nsize of the window used would dictate\
    \ memory and computational requirements of\nthe unit used for deploying the FDS\
    \ system. Another important factor in windowing\nsensor signals is whether overlapping\
    \ is used during the windowing process or not.\nThis might be important to allow\
    \ for smooth transitions between different windows.\n2.5.3\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is the process of determining quantities from data which charac-\n\
    terizes it for a desired task appropriately. Feature extraction not only aims\
    \ to capture\nimportant aspects of the data being worked on but also to present\
    \ its content in a\nreduced size, thereby, making use of the data easier. Feature\
    \ extraction is a typ-\nical step of the a signal processing and machine learning\
    \ workflow and follows the\nwindowing step. There are different types of features\
    \ which have been computed\nfor fall detection applications, common feature computations\
    \ include the determina-\ntion of time domain features, frequency domain features,\
    \ statistical features etc. or\nsome combination from sensor data in FDS. Feature\
    \ extraction is followed by either a\nthresholding algorithm to sensor values\
    \ or a machine/deep learning model. For deep\nlearning, there have been some end\
    \ to end deep learning approaches which skip the\nstep of manual feature extraction.\
    \ In such approaches, deep learning networks such\nas CNN may be used to extract\
    \ features followed by other networks such as LSTM\nto determine falls, an example\
    \ is proposed in [415].\n2.6\nLiterature Review\nAs discussed previously, wearable\
    \ fall detection systems present several advantages\nwhen used for fall detection\
    \ purposes such as non-intrusiveness, ease of mobility, small\nsize of deployment,\
    \ low cost and that many implementations are typically standalone\nsystems. This\
    \ added with the fact that sensors and other components which are used\n82\nin\
    \ such systems have been becoming cheaper and cheaper to produce has resulted\
    \ in\na lot of interest in the development of wearable FDS by researchers and\
    \ technologists\nalike. Therefore, wearable FDS methodologies have gained considerable\
    \ interest in\nfall detection research. We discuss some of the popular methodologies\
    \ proposed in\nthis regard.\nThe authors in Mrozek et al. [416] present a complete\
    \ design of a wearable fall\ndetection system for an Internet of Things scenario.\
    \ They conduct two experiments\nwith their system, in one experiment, data is\
    \ collected from a gyroscope and an\naccelerometer and sent to the cloud for fall\
    \ detection (as a web service) while in\nthe second experiment, fall detection\
    \ is performed on the edge node (smart phone).\nThrough their experiments they\
    \ conclude that performing fall detection on the edge\nnode results in less network\
    \ traffic and storage requirements for the cloud. Algo-\nrithmically speaking,\
    \ they extract 3 second overlapping windows from measurements\nof both sensors,\
    \ perform feature extraction and pass it on to a boosted decision tree\nclassifier\
    \ for determining whether a fall has taken place or not. Moreover, the boosted\n\
    decision tree classifier was trained using the SisFall [417] dataset. Another\
    \ IoT based\nsystem is proposed by Marquez et al. [418] who develop a fall detection\
    \ system for\nIoT on the edge. They first gather data from an accelerometer and\
    \ a gyroscope placed\non the waist of multiple subjects and train a support vector\
    \ machine classifier on a\ncombination of raw sensor values and its standard deviation.\
    \ They are able to deploy\ntheir system successfully and achieve satisfactory\
    \ results. Moreover, feature selection\nis also performed before the classification\
    \ stage. A fog based fall detection model has\nbeen proposed by Sarabia-J’acome\
    \ et al. [419] who utilize a Long Short Term Memory\nRecurrent Neural Network\
    \ in their method. Edge nodes collect Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) measurements\
    \ and relay them to a fog node which processes the data to\ndetermine if a fall\
    \ has taken place or not. One motivation for them to develop RNN\nmodels over\
    \ a Convolutional Neural Network one is the requirement of less param-\neters\
    \ and thus less computational requirements. Their final model consists of a 1D\n\
    CNN layer followed by two LSTM layers and a fully connected layer for classification\n\
    and is trained using raw data (window of 15s) from the SisFall dataset.\nZurbuchen\
    \ et al. in [420] provide a comparison of various machine learning al-\ngorithms\
    \ for fall detection while using data from the SisFall dataset. They perform\n\
    experiments using Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting\
    \ tree,\nK-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines. Segments of 10 seconds\
    \ are ex-\ntracted from the trials in the SisFall dataset and various time and\
    \ frequency domain\nfeatures are computed for those segments. These are then passed\
    \ on to the classifiers.\nThrough their experiments, they find that Random Forest\
    \ and Gradient Boosting\ntrees perform the best among the considered methods.\
    \ Another comparison of var-\nious ML algorithms is provided by Chelli and P¨atzold\
    \ in [421] who compare the\nperformance of a number of machine learning algorithms\
    \ on two datasets, the Cogent\nLabs dataset [422] and the one provided in [423].\
    \ The algorithms they consider are\nan artificial neural network, K-NN, an ensemble\
    \ bagged tree (EBT) and Quadratic\nSupport Vector Machine (QSVM). They compute\
    \ several time and frequency domain\nfeatures from accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ signals and pass them on to the classi-\nfiers. Their best performing classifiers\
    \ were QSVM and EBT. Kerdjidj et al. in [424]\n83\nuse compressive sensing to\
    \ explore the use of different modalities for fall detection\npurposes. The performance\
    \ of accelerometer only and an accelerometer - gyroscope\nsensor combination in\
    \ a fall detection scenario is compared. A Shimmer device [425]\nis used to capture\
    \ data from 17 volunteers asked to perform activities of daily living\nas well\
    \ as fall like movements. They first extract segments of length 2.56 seconds\n\
    from their recordings before performing feature extraction and passing it on to\
    \ four\ndifferent machine learning classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector\
    \ Machines,\nDecision Trees and an Ensemble Classifier (EC). They conduct two\
    \ such experiments,\none with compressive sensing and the other without. Their\
    \ results indicate that the\nEC classifier and SVM perform the best with the help\
    \ of compressive sensing included\nin the pipeline. A ’transfer learning’ approach\
    \ towards fall detection is provided by\nFanez et al. in [426] and they test it\
    \ on the UMAFall [427] dataset and the FallOVI\ndataset (created by them). Using\
    \ a finite state machine which captures windows\nof accelerometer measurements\
    \ based on peak values, the authors convert the win-\ndowed segments into string\
    \ representations using symbolic aggregate approximation\n(SAX) [428]. During\
    \ training each user performs normal ADLs and falls for a short\nperiod of time.\
    \ Peak values are determined from sensor measurements and used to\ncreate bag\
    \ of words using SAX. After this, normal operation of the system starts\nand information\
    \ retrieval (term frequency - inverse term frequency) values are used\nto determine\
    \ what label to give to new SAX words derived from sensor values. If a\ndetermined\
    \ word is not similar (using Manhattan distance) to any word in the bag of\nwords\
    \ (K-NN clustering is used to group similar words), a fall event is suggested\
    \ to\nhave occurred. ’Transfer learning’ involves the use of clusters formed by\
    \ other users\n(performing activities only) as the starting point of the training.\
    \ Their experiment\ncompared an SVM classifier with their information retrieval\
    \ based scheme. They are\nable to detect falls all the time with the UMAfall dataset\
    \ but have a high number\nof false positives for the FallOVI dataset. An noticeable\
    \ aspect of this approach is\nthe use of clustering and ’feature extraction’ as\
    \ strings. In Giuffrida et al. [429]\nthe authors use data from the SisFall dataset\
    \ and an SVM classifier to differentiate\nbetween falls and no-fall samples. They\
    \ extract slices (of 1 second) from the SisFall\ntrials and label each slice as\
    \ containing a fall or not. A number of features were then\ncomputed for each\
    \ slice before feature selection was performed and an SVM classifier\nwas trained\
    \ to determine the output class.\nDeep Learning methods have also been widely\
    \ used for fall detection purposes.\nCasilari et al. in [430] explore the contribution\
    \ of the gyroscope sensor for use in\ncombined accelerometer-gyroscope based fall\
    \ detection systems.\nTo do this, they\nmake use of measurements from the SisFall\
    \ dataset, extract observation windows of\n5 seconds around peaks of accelerometer\
    \ sensor signal values over a trace and pass\nthem on to a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network with four convolutional layers, three\nmax pooling layers followed by\
    \ one fully connected layer for classification. Training is\nperformed in two\
    \ different sets of experiments, one including gyroscope data and the\nother without\
    \ it. They note that the results they get while using only accelerometer\nsignal\
    \ measurements are better than that when using data from both sensors. A\nCNN\
    \ is used for fall detection purposes by Santos et al. in [431] from accelerometer\n\
    measurements. Their network consists of six convolutional layers, two max pooling\n\
    84\nlayers in between followed by a fully connected layer for classification.\n\
    They use\ndata from the URFD dataset [432] and the Smart Watch and Notch datset\
    \ [433] in\ntheir experiments. They note that their model performs best when they\
    \ use data\naugmentation for both the datasets. However, this was achieved by\
    \ two different\nvariants of the same model. This highlights the point of a single\
    \ model not necessarily\nperforming well on all datasets. Another interesting\
    \ aspect of their work is the use of\nthe Mathews Correlation Coefficient to evaluate\
    \ performance of their algorithms. A\nmodified AlexNet [434] has been used in\
    \ [435] by Alarifi et. al. They collect tri-axial\ndata from inertial measurement\
    \ sensors consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer at six different\
    \ positions on a subjects body. A total of 16 activities of\ndaily living and\
    \ 20 falls were recorded by them. Feature extraction is then performed\nin terms\
    \ of various statistical measurements as well as frequency analysis. This is\n\
    followed by principal component analysis and then passed on to the classification\n\
    stage consisting of an optimized AlexNet ConvNet. Waheed et. al. in [436] develop\n\
    a FDS using a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. They\n\
    consider the binary case of fall and no fall and perform experiments using the\
    \ SisFall\ndataset as well as the UP-Fall dataset [437]. Their network consists\
    \ of eight layers\nin total. Two Bi-LSTM layers and two fully connected layers\
    \ with dropouts being\nused for regularization. Training is performed with creating\
    \ missing values in the\ndata to introduce noise tolerancy.\nCasiliri et al.\n\
    in [438] provide a performance\ncomparison for a CNN network on multiple public\
    \ fall detection datasets. The aim\nof their work is to test the cross-application\
    \ of a similar CNN network trained on\ndifferent datasets. They set their experiments\
    \ up by training a four layer CNN on\neach dataset separately for fall detection\
    \ on 14 datasets (using similar positions of\nsensor placement) on windows of\
    \ 5 seconds for accelerometer signals. Their results\nindicate a very good performance\
    \ of the network for the SisFall dataset, however, it\ndoesn’t perform very well\
    \ for most of the other datasets, in some cases, performing\nless than random\
    \ chance, which is quite surprising. Their experiments do however,\nhighlight\
    \ an issue with the well accepted notion that an algorithm developed on some\n\
    benchmark dataset will necessarily work similarly well with other datasets.\n\
    The\nauthors suggest that the erratic performance of their method could be due\
    \ to the\ndifference in the nature of the data in terms of sampling frequency\
    \ used, range of\nthe sensor and the varying type of movements. Another cross-dataset\
    \ approach for\nfall detection has been proposed in [439] where the authors use\
    \ a combination of a\nCNN and Long Short Term Memory network to extract features\
    \ followed by a K-\nNearest Neighbor classifer to detect falls as well as identify\
    \ the subjects within four\nfall datasets, DFNAPAS [440], SisFall, UniMiB-SHAR\
    \ [441] and ASLH [442]. The\nnetwork is trained using the DFNAPAS dataset, before\
    \ training the network however,\ndata augmentation is carried out for the fall\
    \ class. Their best results are achieved\nfor a value of K = 3 and they achieve\
    \ good results for all experiments. They observe\nthat using a deep learning architecture\
    \ for feature extraction purposes along with a\nmachine learning classifier performs\
    \ better than a using a fully connected layer at the\nclassification stage.\n\
    Post fall intelligence is an important research area in the field of fall detection\n\
    as it can be useful in determining various post fall injuries [443] and serve\
    \ as an\n85\nintelligence parameter [444] for doctors. Jung et al. in [445] also\
    \ target detection\nof pre-impact falls for wearable airbag deployment. Their\
    \ method involves the ap-\nplication of a threshold on determined features from\
    \ accelerometer and gyroscope\nmeasurement measurements. The thresholds are then\
    \ applied to a dataset collected\nby them and also on the SisFall dataset. The\
    \ threshold is determined by performing\na grid search on the extracted features\
    \ from their dataset to maximize specificity and\nsensitivity. They do note that\
    \ some activties like sitting down quickly on a chair or a\nmattress triggered\
    \ false positives. Moreover, when applied to SisFall, their methods\nperformance\
    \ is not as high as achieved by methods based on ML/DL. Koo et. al.\n[446] present\
    \ experiments for post fall detection from a combination of self collected\ndata\
    \ and the SisFall dataset. They conduct tests using sliding windows as well as\
    \ dis-\ncrete windows from these signals and compute statistical features from\
    \ them. After\nfeature extraction, two different classifiers, the artificial neural\
    \ network and support\nvector machine are tested with the computed features as\
    \ well as raw sensor values.\nThey find that both ANN and SVM are suitable for\
    \ use in post fall detection sce-\nnarios. Another approach looking at the different\
    \ phases of a fall has been presented\nin [447] where Hsieh et. al. use accelerometer\
    \ sensor data to differentiate between\nfive phases of a fall, pre-fall, free-fall,\
    \ impact, resting and recovery and the initial\nand end static phases. To do this,\
    \ they compute various time domain and statistical\nfeatures and test five classifiers,\
    \ SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision\nTrees and Adaptive Boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost). For their experimental setup, the best\nresults were achieved using\
    \ the K-NN classifier. In Musci et al. [448], the authors\npropose a RNN based\
    \ method to differentiate between falls, pre-impact falls (state\nwhere a person\
    \ is in a dangerous state of transition which may result in a falls) and\nnormal\
    \ activities. Their motivation for including preimpact falls is to enable timely\n\
    deployment of a fall protection system. First, they label data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset\nto form three classes. They then extract windows of duration 1.28 seconds\
    \ with an\noverlap of 50% from the sensor signals and pass them on to their network\
    \ which\nconsists of two fully connected layers and two-layer LSTM layers. Moreover,\
    \ due to\nan imbalanced training set, they define a new balancing loss function.\
    \ Their method\nresults in fall detection good results for the three classes considered.\
    \ A CNN-LSTM\napproach has been proposed in [449] by Yu et al. for detection of\
    \ pre-impact fall and\nfalls in the SisFall dataset. They provide a comparison\
    \ of standalone CNN, LSTM\nand a combined CNN-LSTM architecture for this task\
    \ and also implement them on\na Jetson Nano. They define a pre-impact fall as\
    \ the time interval where a subject\ntransitions from a controlled state to a\
    \ state which may lead to a fall. First, they\nlabel data in the SisFall dataset\
    \ as described in [448] to form a three class problem.\nThey achieved their best\
    \ results for their CNN+LSTM model having four CNN layers\nfollowed by two LSTM\
    \ layers and a fully connected layer for classification. Their ap-\nproach highlights\
    \ the combined capability of CNN-LSTM for feature extraction. An\naspect of fall\
    \ intelligence is direction, in [450] Lee et al. use the velocity vector from\n\
    the acceleration sensor in a smartphone for fall detection with direction and\
    \ then\nlater on in [451], they use the standard deviation of the accemerometer\
    \ and gyro-\nscope sensor measurements from a smart phone to determine falls and\
    \ fall direction.\nThey perform a small experiment and are able to differentiate\
    \ between left, right,\n86\nfront and backward falls. More work on fall detection\
    \ with direction was performed\nby the authors in [452] who use an accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope combination along\nwith a kalman filter for tilt estimation. Fall\
    \ detection is then performed using an\nSVM classifier. Falls with direction detection\
    \ has been attempted in [453, 454] by\nthe same authors. They collect accelerometer\
    \ data from various subjects and extract\nthree features from the recordings for\
    \ each axis, the mean, standard deviation and\nprincipal components (using Principal\
    \ Component Analysis). These are then passed\non to a SVM classifier to differentiate\
    \ between a forward, backward, left and right\nfall and ADLs.\nWhile direction\
    \ aware fall detection is an important determination in terms of post\nfall intelligence,\
    \ fall detection with severity is necessary since it could help provide\nindications\
    \ to falls with immediate recovery or otherwise, as falls without immediate\n\
    recovery would be more detrimental to health than a fall with immediate recovery\
    \ as\nhas been suggested in [455]. In [456] the authors attempt to classify between\
    \ different\nfalls (direction: forward, backward, right, left and intensity: hard,\
    \ soft [fall on knees\nfirst, then on floor]) and five different ADLs using accelerometer\
    \ data. They collected\ndata for their experiments using a triaxial accelerometer\
    \ mounted on the chest. Fea-\nture extraction consists of first concatenating\
    \ acceleration values in each axis and\nthen using a Debauchies-2 level-3 wavelet\
    \ which are then sent to the classification\nstage. In the classification stage\
    \ five different classifiers, an ANN, a Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) Network,\
    \ Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (LDA) are used through a voting machine to determine\nfalls. A voting machine\
    \ (VM) involves multiple classifiers giving a vote towards any of\nthe multiple\
    \ classes and the sum of the vote is compared against a vote threshold to\ndetermine\
    \ the event that has taken place. In their work, the authors train individual\n\
    VMs for all the activity and fall types in their dataset by structuring them all\
    \ in par-\nallel and adding a comparator function at the end of the pipeline.\
    \ Moreover, a K-NN\nmulticlass classifier also feeds in to the comparator and\
    \ is trained while training of\nthe other classifier, it is provided the true\
    \ value of the activity being input to the\nclassification stage. The authors\
    \ show that their dataset works very well. A valuable\ninsight about their work\
    \ is the ensembling mechanism the authors have employed to\ndetermine fall directions.\
    \ In [457], Hussain et al. propose a fall detection system that\ncan first determine\
    \ falls and then the type of fall using data from the SisFall dataset.\nThey accomplish\
    \ this in a hierarchical setup where their system first considers fall\ndetection\
    \ as a binary problem, whether a fall has taken place or not, and if a fall\n\
    has been detected, it classifies between the various falls in the dataset. Their\
    \ system\nis designed to work with 10 second non-overlapping windows of accelerometer\
    \ and\ngyroscope signals. Data from each record is first low pass filtered before\
    \ two different\ntypes of feature sets, consisting of various time domain and\
    \ statistical features, are\ncomputed on the data. This is then followed by the\
    \ machine learning stage where\nthree different classifiers are tested, K-NN,\
    \ SVM and RFC. In the fall detection stage,\nstatistical features are computed\
    \ from ADL and fall signals and sent to the three clas-\nsifiers for the preliminary\
    \ binary classification. After a fall has been determined to\nhave happened, numerous\
    \ other statistical and time domain features are then com-\nputed on the data\
    \ before being sent to the next stage to determine the type of fall\n87\nactivity\
    \ taking place. In their experiments, the authors find that K-NN is most effec-\n\
    tive in differentiating between falls and ADLs where as RFC performs the best\
    \ when\nthe different fall activities need to be determined. This work highlights\
    \ the usefulness\nof a hierarchical approach towards non-binary fall detection.\
    \ One proposed method\nto perform combined activity recognition and fall detection\
    \ has been presented in\n[458]. In this, Li et. al. use multi-modal sensor fusion\
    \ and a Bi-LSTM classification\nnetwork to differentiate between five activities\
    \ of daily living and a fall. The sensors\nthey use are an inertial sensor placed\
    \ on the wrist, waist and ankle as well as a radar\nsensor. After pre-processing\
    \ both the inertial measurement and radar signals, various\nstatistical and moment\
    \ computations were performed to be used as features. These\nwere passed on to\
    \ the multilayer Bi-LSTM network after feature selection to deter-\nmine the output\
    \ class. One thing to note is that both both [458] and [421] consider\nfall as\
    \ a single category rather than considering falls as a detailed problem (direction\n\
    and/or severity) in itself. More recent work by We et al. [459] also considers\
    \ ac-\ntivity recognition and fall detection together. They use inertial measurement\
    \ sensor\ndata from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset [460] and the SmartFall\
    \ dataset [433].\nThe MobiAct dataset contains data from four falls and nine activities\
    \ of daily living\nwhereas the SmartFall dataset has non-fall and fall recordings.\
    \ In their experimenta-\ntion, they compare the performance of different machine\
    \ learning models and several\ndeep learning models, including a CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM\
    \ combination and Gated\nRecurrent Units. The machine learning models are trained\
    \ by computing time and\nfrequency domain features whereas the deep learning models\
    \ are trained using raw\nsensor data. They find that the GRU designed by them\
    \ consisting of two GRU units\nfollowed by a softmax classification layer is the\
    \ best performing model. Another deep\nlearning approach utilizing sequential\
    \ modeling for a fall detection system that also\nconsiders ADLs has been presented\
    \ by Seng¨ul et al. [461]. They collect their own\ndata for two types of falls\
    \ and four activities of daily living. After data augmentation\non the minority\
    \ classes, they use a Bi-LSTM for classification. Le et al. [462] propose\na non-binary\
    \ fall detection scheme utilizing a collection of time, frequency frequency\n\
    domain features in addition to the three Hjorth parameters of activity, mobility\
    \ and\ncomplexity. They use data from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset and the\
    \ UP-Fall\ndataset. They are able to achieve good results on both datasets using\
    \ all three feature\ntypes with a random forest classifier.\nThe use of attention\
    \ based models has also been finding increasing usage in fall\ndetection research.\
    \ Yhdego [463] use an attention model to perform binary fall de-\ntection. The\
    \ fall dataset is collected by them and after windowing, the authors use\ntime2vec\
    \ positional encoding on the data. Their network consists of three attention\n\
    blocks each consisting of multiheaded self attention followed by normalization\
    \ and a\nfully connected network. After the attention blocks follow two fully\
    \ connected layers.\nThey find that their network incorporating attention performs\
    \ well in differentiating\nbetween fall and non-fall samples. Another interesting\
    \ approach using attention is\npresented by Liu et al. [464]. Inorder to apply\
    \ attention on both temporal (step wise)\nand spatial (channel wise) aspects of\
    \ the signals, a gated scheme is suggested. A fully\nconnected layer is used to\
    \ determine the embeddings before positional information is\nadded to the data.\
    \ Positional encoding is only used for stepwise attention as channel\n88\nwise\
    \ positions are not useful. Self attention is performed in the step-wise part\
    \ of the\nnetwork and is carried out for the individual channels in a pairwise\
    \ fashion across all\ntime steps while the channel wise attention is performed\
    \ across the different channels\nacross all time-steps. The outputs of these two\
    \ units are combined through a fully\nconnected network which weighs them before\
    \ concatenation and classification.\n2.7\nFall detection Datasets\nThere are several\
    \ datasets published for use in algorithm development for fall detec-\ntion as\
    \ has been noted in [438]. Of these, for this case study, we choose two datasets,\n\
    these are the SisFall and the K-Fall dataset. The SisFall [417] dataset is chosen\
    \ as\nit contains recordings of elderly people which are most at risk from injury\
    \ due to\nfalls and therefore should provide a good representation of activities\
    \ of the elderly. It\nshould be noted that its one of the most used dataset for\
    \ fall detection purposes [438].\nThe other dataset used is the K-Fall [465] dataset.\
    \ It was released on the pattern of\nthe SisFall dataset and includes more activities\
    \ compared to SisFall. A summary of\nthe datasets is presented in the next section.\n\
    2.7.1\nSisFall Dataset\nThe SisFall dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ recordings of 19 types of\nactivities of daily living and falls. Two accelerometers\
    \ and one gyroscope were placed\non the waist and used for making the measurements.\
    \ This location was chosen so as\nto ensure that all body movements while performing\
    \ the activities/falls were captured\nby the sensory system. Furthermore, the\
    \ data recordings involved 23 young people\nbetween the ages of 19-30 years old\
    \ and 15 elderly people between the ages of 60-75\nyears. The dataset contains\
    \ annotated sensor measurements of each of these ADLs\nand falls recorded as well\
    \ as video recordings of sample experiments. There are four\nmain types of falls\
    \ present, six of them are forward falls , three backward falls, four\nlateral\
    \ falls and two vertical falls. The types of falls performed were directed through\n\
    a survey taken from elderly people living independently as well as the ones living\n\
    in retirement homes and include scenarios of slipping and tripping. Moreover,\
    \ they\nare preceded by various types of ADLs being performed to make the recordings\
    \ as\nclose to a real world scenario as possible. The ADLs recorded were approved\
    \ by\nmedical personnel and were chosen so as to be similar to falls. The ADLs\
    \ include\nhigh mobility activities such as walking up/down stairs, jogging as\
    \ well as activities\nwhich can be confused with falls such as quickly sitting\
    \ in a chair, bending at the\nknee and stumble while walking etc. In total, there\
    \ were 2706 ADL recordings and\n1798 fall recordings. The SisFall data is utilized\
    \ in this study as it has been the\nthe dataset of choice for several previous\
    \ research approaches addressing the subject\nof fall detection [466, 467, 468,\
    \ 436, 469] and also because the volunteer makeup\nconsists of both men and women,\
    \ young adults and the elderly. The ADLs and Falls\nin the SisFall dataset have\
    \ been presented in Table 32 with a brief description of the\nactivities and falls\
    \ provided as well.\n89\nTable 32. ADL and Falls present in the SisFall dataset.\n\

    \ the SisFall dataset and contains 15\nfall types and 21 ADLs. The falls in K-Fall\
    \ are the same as those in SisFall. However,\nin the case of ADLs, they remove\
    \ the activity of sitting in and getting out of a car\nand combine some of the\
    \ activities while adding static activities of sitting on a chair,\nsitting on\
    \ a sofa and lying down.\nA total of 2729 ADL recordings and 2346 fall\nrecordings\
    \ are present in the dataset. This dataset is included in the study to test\n\
    cross-dataset fall detection. The details of the K-Fall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table\n33.\n2.8\nExperiments\nThis section discusses the experiments conducted\

    \ and severity. The second, third and\nfour experiments involved the inclusion\
    \ of activities of daily living classification in\naddition to the fall classes\
    \ considered in the first experiment. Moreover, experiment\nfour presents results\
    \ for a cross-dataset fall detection scenario.\n2.8.1\nFall Detection with Severity\
    \ and Direction consideration\nThis section describes the work on fall detection\
    \ considering severity and direction\nwhile only considering sensor data for falls.\
    \ The experiment has been performed as\ntwo tasks, one for determining falls considering\
    \ direction only and the other while\nconsidering both direction as well as severity.\n\
    2.8.1.1\nData Labeling\nTo perform fall detection that is direction and severity\
    \ aware, we only considered fall\n91\ndata from the SisFall dataset. As can be\
    \ seen from Table 32, most of the falls in\nthe dataset have been labelled as\
    \ either being in the forward, backward or lateral\ndirection.\nHowever, two of\
    \ the falls (F06 and F07) are not labeled in terms of\ndirection. For the considerations\
    \ of this research work, these were assigned the labels\nof Forward and Lateral\
    \ respectively using the videos of sample trials provided by the\ndataset authors.\n\
    Concerning fall severity, while the original labels from the dataset contained\
    \ in-\nformation for most falls for direction, the approach followed by Gibson\
    \ et al. [456]\nwas used to determine the severity of falls. According to the\
    \ practice followed by\nthem, all falls where in some support was used to soften\
    \ the impact of the fall were\nconsidered as soft falls whereas all falls where\
    \ the subject fell directly were classified\nas hard falls. This resulted in six\
    \ classes for fall types with hard and soft for ima-\npact and forward, backward\
    \ and lateral for direction. These are Forward Soft Falls\n(FSF), Forward Hard\
    \ Falls (FHF), Backward Soft Falls (BSF), Backward Hard Falls\n(BHF), Lateral\
    \ Soft Falls (LSF) and Lateral Hard Falls (LHF). These labels have\nbeen summarized\
    \ in Table 34.\nTable 34. Labeling used for Fall only classification for the SisFall\

    \ Direction and Severity.\n2.8.1.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology used for this\
    \ experiment follows a typ-\nical machine learning pipeline as shown in Figure\
    \ 17. First, we pre-process the data\nwhich involves extraction of sensor segments\
    \ representing falls. This is followed by\nfeature extraction that aims to extract\
    \ useful representations from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor data. Lastly,\
    \ feature selection is carried out where we aim to\nreduce the number of features\
    \ used in the last stage that is classification.\nData Pre-processing\nRecordings\
    \ in the SisFall dataset vary in length between 12 and 100 seconds. The\ntrial\
    \ recordings for falls in the SisFall dataset consist of subjects performing various\n\
    activities before experiencing the fall. For a sound feature extraction process,\
    \ we\nextract equal duration segments of sensor readings from these trials that\
    \ represent\nthe fall taking place along with some part of the pre-fall activity\
    \ being performed.\nTo do this, for each record we first calculate the acceleration\
    \ magnitude (also called\nthe Signal Magnitude Vector (SMV) ) [430] for all sensor\
    \ value samples within a trial\nrecording. The SMV can be calculated as given\
    \ in Eq.1.\nSMVj =\nq\f\fAxj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAyj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAzj\n\f\f2\n(1)\n\
    93\nwhere SMVj represents the SMV value for a sample j in a given trial. The SMV\n\
    is calculated for all samples and the sample location for the SMV peak value is\n\
    determined within the trial. This is then used as the midpoint for extracting\
    \ a 2.5\nsecond segment from the trial. A segment length of 2.5 seconds was chosen\
    \ as it was\nvisually found to capture all the falls as well as some part of the\
    \ pre-fall activity being\nperformed. Using this scheme, segments were extracted\
    \ for all the fall trials in the\ndataset.\nThere are a total of 1798 fall samples\
    \ in the dataset, after the labeling used, there\nwere a total of 838 samples\
    \ for the forward fall category, 360 samples for the backward\nfall category and\
    \ 600 samples for the lateral fall category. Sample waveforms for the\nthree directions\
    \ of falls and three severity levels have been shown in Appendix A.\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is used to convert inputs in to more useful representations.\
    \ In\nthis experiment, we take cue from the work of [420, 470] who use various\
    \ time and\nfrequency domain features successfully for fall detection and recognition\
    \ of activities\nof daily living. Table 35 lists the features computed for each\
    \ extracted segment. Each\nof these features have been computed for every axis\
    \ of the considered accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor measurements.\nTable 35.\

    \ total numbers of X fall below\nit. Therefore, the 25th Percentile (also called\
    \ the First Quartile) is the number in X\nbelow which exactly 25% of the values\
    \ fall. Similarly, 75th Percentile (also called\nthe Third Quartile) is the number\
    \ in X below which exactly 75% of the values fall.\nAnother important quantity\
    \ concerning percentiles is the Interquartile Range (IQ\n94\nRange), also called\
    \ the Midspread. The IQ Range is the difference between the 75th\nPercentiles\
    \ and the 25th Percentiles.\nDelta\nThe Delta represents the difference between\
    \ the minimum and maximum\nvalue of a set of numeric values X.\nKurtosis\nIt’s\
    \ a metric for how much a distribution’s tails diverge from that of\na normal\
    \ distribution. A large Kurtosis values indicates to larger extremity of the\n\
    divergences which can be thought of as outliers. The Kurtosis for a set of numerical\n\
    values X can be calculated as given in Eq. 2.\nKurtosis(X) =\n1\nNσ4\nN\nX\ni=1\n\
    (xi − µ)4\n(2)\nMean\nFor a set of values X, the arithmetic mean or the average\
    \ returns the\ncenter value of X. Mathematically it is given in Eq. 3.\nMean(X)\
    \ =\nPN\ni=1 xi\nN\n(3)\nMedian\nFor a set of values X, the median indicates to\
    \ the central tendency of\nX. It divides a set of values in to two equal parts.\
    \ For a set X of size N arranged in\nascending order, the median can be calculated\
    \ as in Eq. 4.\nMedian(X) = X[N + 1\n2\n]\n(4)\nMaximum\nFor a set of values X,\
    \ the maximum value represents the largest\nvalue in the set X.\nMinimum\nFor\
    \ a set of values X, the minimum value represents the smallest\nvalue in the set\
    \ X.\nSkewness\nThe Skewness measures the lack of symmetry in the probability\
    \ dis-\ntribution of data around its mean. It is calculated as in Eq. 5.\nSkewness(X)\
    \ =\n1\nNσ3\nN\nX\ni=1\n(xi − µ)3\n(5)\nStandard Deviation and Variance\nThe Standard\
    \ Deviation measures the\nvariation of a set of numerical values around its mean.\
    \ For a set of numerical values\nX, the standard deviation can be calculated as\
    \ in Eq. 6.\n95\nStd(X) =\nsPN\ni=1(xi − µ)2\nN\n(6)\nwhere µ is the Mean of X.\
    \ The Variance of X is the square of the Standard\nDeviation.\nPower Spectral\
    \ Density\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is an indication\nto the power content\
    \ of a signal with respect to its frequency. It therefore helps to\nunderstand\
    \ the distribution of power in the signal for the different frequencies that\n\
    comprise it. The PSD has been computed using the Welch method [471]. Once the\n\
    PSD has been computed, the mean, median and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values\nof\
    \ the PSD are computed.\nPower Spectral Entropy\nThe Power Spectral Entropy (PSE)\
    \ is a measure of\nthe entropy in the power spectrum of a signal and indicates\
    \ to the complexity present\ntherein. It is computed as an entropy calculation\
    \ on the normalized PSD estimate.\nSimilar to the PSD computation, the Welch method\
    \ was used to estimate the PSD\nbefore PSE calculations were performed.\nThe aforementioned\
    \ quantities were computed for all windowed samples of the fall\nrecordings. In\
    \ total, this resulted in 96 features being computed for each segment.\nBefore\
    \ these features are passed on to the next stage, normalization was performed\n\
    feature wise for each sensor.\nFeature Selection\nFeature selection is an important\
    \ step in the machine learning pipeline. It not only\nhelps to reduce the feature\
    \ set size used in an application which helps computationally\nbut may also result\
    \ in performance improvement as observed by [472]. Feature se-\nlection is performed\
    \ using Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE)\n[473] which involves\
    \ determining the importance of features by eliminating features\niteratively\
    \ and looking at classifier performance. It starts by developing a model us-\n\
    ing all the available features within the dataset, in every iteration, the feature\
    \ that\nhas the ’least importance/contribution’ is discarded and a new model is\
    \ fitted with\nthe remaining features. This process is carried out until a pre-decided\
    \ number of\nfeatures remain. Since in this work, our goal is to reduce the number\
    \ of features\nfrom the original count, we perform manual tests by establishing\
    \ a baseline for the\nperformance of our models. The baseline is formed by using\
    \ all features for each\nof our classification tasks and using the highest weighted\
    \ F1-score achieved as the\nperformance goal cut-off for the reduction of features.\
    \ This step will ensure that we\natleast get the same performance as the original\
    \ feature set.\nClassification\nClassification refers to the usage of a classification\
    \ algorithm, also called a classifier\n96\nto determine the output ’label’ or\
    \ category given a set of input values called features.\nIn the current setting,\
    \ the classification problem is a supervised one wherein the\nclassifier is provided\
    \ inputs and their corresponding output labels which allow it\nto learn the relationship\
    \ between the input and the output.\nOnce this mapping\nhas been sufficiently\
    \ learned (a process called training) the trained classifier can\nbe provided\
    \ unlabeled inputs for it to predict an output label value or class. The\nefficacy\
    \ of the classifier in predicting the correct output is measured through various\n\
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc. This experiment consists\
    \ of\ntwo classification experiments being performed, one is the direction only\
    \ experiment\nwhere the classifiers used are trained to distinguish between the\
    \ three direction of falls\ngiven the input feature set and another experiment\
    \ where the classifiers are trained\nto determine fall directions and severity\
    \ together.\nFour different classifiers were tested to perform these tasks, these\
    \ are the Random\nForest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and\
    \ Extreme Gradient\nBoost (XGBoost). All of the classifiers were trained using\
    \ five fold cross validation\nwith a stratified split and a parameter search being\
    \ performed for tuning purposes.\nSupport Vector Machines\nSupport Vector Machine\
    \ is a supervised learning\nalgorithm that, in its simplest form tries to fit\
    \ a line in between data samples of two\ndifferent classes to separate them. The\
    \ criteria used by the SVM to fit this line is\nthe maximization of the distance\
    \ between the line and the (data) points closest to it.\nThis concept of using\
    \ a line to separate two dimensional data can be extended to two\ndimensional\
    \ planes being used for separating three-dimensional data and hyperplanes\nfor\
    \ higher dimensional data. SVMs are quite flexible in that they can not only be\
    \ used\nto work with linearly separable data but also with data that is not linearly\
    \ separable.\nThis is achieved using Kernel functions which map the nonlinearly\
    \ distributed data\nin to a higher dimensional space to make it linearly separable\
    \ (as much as possible).\nThere are several kernel functions available to be used\
    \ for this purpose such as the\nhyperbolic tangent, radial basis, sigmoid, polynomial\
    \ etc. Optimizing the SVM re-\nquires the tuning of the cost parameter C, a small\
    \ value of C indicates an underfit\nwhereas a very large value of C indicates\
    \ an overfit.\nEven though, the current experiment considers using SVMs for a\
    \ classification\ntaks, it should also be mentioned that SVM’s are not limited\
    \ to application towards\nclassification problems and they have also been used\
    \ for regression applications too.\nDecision Tree\nDecision Trees are one of the\
    \ most widely used classification\nalgorithms due to their interpretability. The\
    \ aim of the algorithm is to come up with\nas simple a solution as possible while\
    \ successively dividing the data in to simpler and\nsimpler classification tasks\
    \ based on the values of the features. For a classification\nproblem, given a\
    \ set of input features of the training set, decision trees use the values\nof\
    \ the features to divide or split the dataset in to more simpler sub problems.\
    \ The\naim being to get the largest information gain when choosing the feature/s\
    \ for the\nsplit. Each split point in a decision tree is called a node and each\
    \ split is called a\nbranch. Branches from a given node represent all the possible\
    \ outcomes from that\n97\nnode and may contain subsequent decision nodes as well\
    \ which are called child nodes.\nEach branch ends at a node called the leaf node\
    \ where data points are assigned a\nclass label.\nDepending on the number of input\
    \ features and the output classes, decision trees\ncan be built to classify the\
    \ dataset in a ’complete’ manner due to its iterative parti-\ntioning scheme.\
    \ However, this is undesirable since that would lead to overfitting of the\nmodel\
    \ and also because such trees would lead to a complicated model, which is not\n\
    desirable since that would impact interpretability. The process of removing branches\n\
    and replacing them by leaf nodes is called pruning. Pruning aims to increase the\n\
    models generalizations capabilities and increase robustness. Two paramters which\n\
    are used for this purpose are tree depth limits the number of child nodes present\
    \ in\nevery branch and the number of features used at each split.\nRandom Forest\
    \ Classifier\nRandom forest is a bagging approach towards de-\ncision trees where\
    \ instead of deciding on where to split for each node, for each tree\na random\
    \ subset of features is used and the feature/threshold to split the data is\n\
    determined within that subset of features to separate the data in the best manner\n\
    possible. This process is repeated multiple times which results in various trees\
    \ pro-\nducing possibly different predictions. The predictions from each tree\
    \ are combined\nto form an ensemble either through majority voting or by averaging.\
    \ The imple-\nmentation of Random Forests used in this work uses the averaging\
    \ approach. There\nare several parameters that are important in the tuning of\
    \ Random Forests are the\nnumber of trees created before the averaging process\
    \ starts, the number of levels in\neach tree and more.\nExtreme Gradient Boost\n\
    Extreme Gradient Boost is another ensemble based\ntree algorithm, however compared\
    \ to the RFC, XGBoost uses boosting instead of\nbagging. In boosting, the input\
    \ samples are uniformly weighted and first a ’weak’\nlearner (classifier) is created\
    \ for a given task that doesnt perform well but is sufficient\nin the sense that\
    \ it is better than random guessing. In subsequent iterations of the\nlearner,\
    \ input samples which werent classified correctly by the learner are reweighted\n\
    by assigning larger weights to them while the weights for correctly classified\
    \ inputs\nis reduced. This step is repeated for a number of times with different\
    \ weak learners\nbeing trained.\nThe decision of the weak learners are combined\
    \ through majority\nvoting to determine the output class. Parameters used to tune\
    \ XGBoost are the\nmaximum depth allowed in each tree, the weight settings etc.\n\
    2.8.1.3\nResults\nAs mentioned previously, two separate experiments were conducted,\
    \ first was to dif-\nferentiate between fall directions only and the other to\
    \ differentiate between fall\ndirection as well as severity. The results from\
    \ those experiments are presented here.\nThe metrics considered for judging model\
    \ quality is the F1-score. The F1-score is the\nharmonic mean of the precision\
    \ and recall and is given as in Eq. 7.\n98\nF1 Score = 2 ∗ (Precision ∗ Recall)\n\
    Precision + Recall\n(7)\nwhere Precision is the ratio of the True positive samples\
    \ divided by the sum of the\nTrue positive and False positive samples as given\
    \ in Eq. 8. It is also called positive\npredictive value as it indicates to the\
    \ capability of the classifier to identify correctly\nthe samples of a given class.\n\
    Precision =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Positive\n(8)\nand recall indicates\
    \ to the models capability to identify the samples of a given\nclass over the\
    \ whole dataset. It is also called the sensitivity and is the ratio of the\nTrue\
    \ positives to the sum of the True positives and False Negatives as shown in Eq.\n\
    9.\nRecall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Negative\n(9)\nWe report on\
    \ the F1-scores for each class when discussing classification perfor-\nmance and\
    \ deciding on the best classifier. Moreover, for the best classifier identified\n\
    the precision and recall have also been provided.\nFall direction\nIn this experiment,\
    \ fall segments labeled for direction only were used as input to the\nclassifiers.\
    \ To establish a baseline to be used as a reference in the feature selection\n\
    process, all computed features (96 in total) were passed to the four classifiers.\
    \ The\nbest performing model was found to be the SVM with a weighted F1-score\
    \ of 90.4%.\nFeature selection was then performed keeping in view baseline performance\
    \ of the\nSVM classifier so as to retain or improve this performance baseline\
    \ when choosing a\ngiven number of ’top’ features. Following this rule, feature\
    \ selection resulted in 90\nfeatures. The results are given in Table 36. It can\
    \ be observed from the table that\nthe SVM has outperformed the other algorithms\
    \ in detecting forward and lateral falls\nwhereas it achieves a slightly lower\
    \ F1-score for the backward fall class. Overall the\nSVM has shown to be better\
    \ at discriminating falls with direction.\nTable 36. Fall F1-scores (Fall direction\

    \ experiment, fall segments from the dataset were labeled for direction and\n\
    severity based on the labeling shown in Table 34 and passed to each of the classifiers\n\
    after feature selection. Like before, to establish a baseline, all computed features\
    \ (96\nin total) were passed to the four classifiers. The best weighted F1-score\
    \ of 78.44% was\nachieved by the SVM classifier. We used this value as the baseline\
    \ we aim to achieve\nafter feature selection. With this condition the number of\
    \ features were reduced to\n93. The performance achieved for each of the four\
    \ tested classifers is summarized in\nTable 37. It can be observed that the SVM\
    \ is the best performing classifier for all fall\ntypes bar FHF where the random\
    \ forest classifer achieves a slightly higher F1-score.\nThe highest F1-score\
    \ overall is achieved for the class BSF where as the lowest has\nbeen achieved\
    \ for LHF. When looking at fall direction, falls in the forward direction\ncan\
    \ be seen to be the hardest to identify followed by lateral falls. No such pattern\n\
    can be noted for soft/hard falls.\nTable 37. Fall F1-scores (Fall severity and\

    Discussion\nTo summarize the results from both experiments, we present the individual\
    \ F1-\nscores, Precision and Recall for the best performing classifier in each\
    \ case. These\nhave been presented in Table 38 and Table 39.\nTable 38. Best Results:\

    92.46\nIn both cases the best performing classifier was the SVM. This is inline\
    \ with\nthe findings of other research work as found from the literature review\
    \ [424, 429].\nA surprising outcome during this work was the unsatisfactory performance\
    \ of tree\nbased algorithms contrary to [420], we attribute this to the difference\
    \ in the data\nsegmentation scheme and also the fact that we follow different\
    \ labelling for the data\n100\nTable 39. Best Results: Fall direction and Severity\n\

    in terms of a direction and severity aware system. Moreover, the final weighted\
    \ F1-\nscores for the fall direction experiment was 92% and for the fall direction\
    \ and severity\nwas 79.53% which resulted in an improvement of just above 1% in\
    \ both cases with a\nsmall reduction in the number of features utilized, 90 and\
    \ 93 respectively compared to\n96 in the original feature set. Commenting on the\
    \ direction, the hardest to predict fall\nwas in the lateral direction and the\
    \ classifier incorrectly predicted forward falls and\nlateral falls in both the\
    \ scenarios tested. This highlights the difficulty in capturing\nthe difference\
    \ between these two fall directions using the features considered.\n2.8.2\nFall\
    \ Detection with Severity and Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using\
    \ Wavelet Pooling and K-NN\nThis section provides a framework for a fall and activity\
    \ recognition system. It aims\nto determine an appropriate sensor modality to\
    \ use and the window size to be used\nfor the task. The framework does this as\
    \ a problem of differentiating between various\nactivities of daily living as\
    \ well as various types of falls with regard to fall datection\nbeing direction\
    \ and severity aware. To do this, data from the SisFall dataset is used\nand after\
    \ suitable pre-processing and feature extraction, machine learning algorithms\n\
    are utilized to differentiate between different activities of daily living and\
    \ falls\n2.8.2.1\nData Labeling\nSince we aim to perform activity recognition\
    \ and fall detection with direction and\nseverity, the ADL labeling of the original\
    \ dataset has been modified. This labeling\nhas been shown in Table 40. As can\
    \ be observed from Table 40, the activities Walking\n(W), Jogging (J), Sitting\
    \ (S) and Standing (SB) have been considered for this work\nwhich are typical\
    \ activities in ADL detection problems. Each of these labels includes\ndata from\
    \ multiple original activities, for e.g. activities with original labels of walking\n\
    upstairs and downstairs, walking slowly and walking quickly have been considered\
    \ as\nwalking in this work. A similar scheme has been used for the other three\
    \ activity\nlabels as well. Some of the activities such as being on one’s back\
    \ change to lateral\nposition, wait a moment, and change to one’s back (D14),\
    \ getting in and out of the\ncar (D17), stumble while walking (D18), and gently\
    \ jumping without falling while\ntrying to reach a high object (D19) have not\
    \ been considered. The reason for this\nis that they have very few samples to\
    \ be considered as standalone activities (only\none type of sub-activity and also\
    \ because most of these are not considered in typical\n101\nADL detection scenarios).\
    \ For falls, the labeling same as that for the direction and\nseverity experiment\
    \ has been retained.\nTable 40. ADL Labels used for SisFall Recordings.\nActivity\

    \ work with individual parts being elab-\norated upon in the proceeding subsections.\
    \ As can be seen, the first stage consists of\ndata preprocessing, followed by\
    \ feature extraction and then evaluation or classifica-\ntion.\nData Preprocessing\n\
    Data preprocessing for this experiment was performed in a similar manner to section\n\
    2.8.1 for most recordings. The SMV was computed for the complete recording and\n\
    windowed segments of a fixed duration were extracted.\nWindowed segments are\n\
    extracted in this manner from all considered activities in the SisFall dataset\
    \ except\nthe activities of D01, D02, D03 and D04 which consist of a single trial\
    \ per subject of\nduration 100s. In such cases, continuous windowed segments of\
    \ duration n seconds\nare extracted from the recordings. It is also pertinent\
    \ to mention here that since\nboth accelerometers are placed at the same position,\
    \ we only consider one of the\naccelerometers along with the gyroscope readings\
    \ present in the recorded trials. To\ndetermine the value of n as well as the\
    \ appropriate sensor modality to use for the\nfinal system, experiments were performed\
    \ on the developed framework and the results\nhave been discussed in subsequent\
    \ sections.\nFeature extraction\nIn this experiment, feature extraction consists\

    \ wavelet decomposition and then performing pooling,\nthe inspiration for this\
    \ type of feature extraction came from the work of [475].\n103\nWavelet Decomposition\n\
    Wavelets can be used for a variety of applications\nsuch as spectral analysis\
    \ where they are used to analye a signal in the time-frequency\ndomain, denoising,\
    \ compression and signal enhancement. A wavelet is a function of\nfinite duration\
    \ and has an average value of zero, an example of a mexican hat wavelet\nis shown\
    \ in Figure. 19. The width of the wavelet is called its scale and it is analogous\n\
    to frequency in an inverse manner. A large value of the scale (wider window) allows\n\
    for capturing of low frequency components of the signal whereas a small scale\
    \ value\ncaptures low frequency components.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0.2\n0.1\n\

    \ (Mexican Hat).\nWavelets are convolved with an input signal to produce two sets\
    \ of coefficients.\nThese are called the detail and approximation coefficients.\
    \ The detail component\nrepresents the high frequency component captured by the\
    \ wavelet whereas the ap-\nproximation component represents the low frequency\
    \ part. Since the wavelet has\nonly been convolved once with the signal, these\
    \ coefficients are said to be level 1\ncoefficients. At each level, resulting\
    \ coefficients are downsampled by half to result in\na lower resolution signal.\
    \ Subsequent approximation components can be convolved\nwith the wavelet to result\
    \ in approximation and detail components for the next level\nthus forming what\
    \ is called a wavelet decomposition tree.\nTo perform wavelet decomposition, in\
    \ this experiment, we make use of the Haar\nwavelet [476] shown in Figure. 20.\
    \ Level 4 haar wavelets were computed for each of\nthe extracted segments of the\
    \ signals.\nSpatial Pooling\nThe results from the decomposition provide a large\
    \ number\nof features which would pose a problem for use in the proceeding classification\
    \ stage.\nIn order to reduce the feature dimension size, Spatial Pyramid Pooling\
    \ [477] was\nused. Spatial Pyramid Pooling is an adaptive pooling method which\
    \ was developed\nto address the issue of fluctuating input sizes in CNNs for image-based\
    \ applications,\nand it entails converting varying-size convolutional feature\
    \ maps into fixed-length\nsummarizations. These summarizations, having uniform\
    \ length can then be passed\non to the fully connected parts of the CNN where\
    \ a fixed length input is necessary.\n104\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n\

    Figure 20. Haar Wavelet.\nGiven a pooling size pxp, adaptive pooling works by\
    \ dividing the input in to pxp pieces\nwhile computing the size of each piece\
    \ automatically and performing any necessary\npadding. Once these pieces are created,\
    \ a pooling operation is typically performed\n(max pooling or average pooling\
    \ for e.g.) on each of these pieces to summarize the\ninput into an output of\
    \ fixed size pxp. This results in a fixed output length for any\nsize of the input.\
    \ In this experiment, 4-2-1 1D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used\non the detail\
    \ and approximation coefficients of the wavelet decomposition of activity\nand\
    \ fall data. This process has been shown in Figure 21. Each coefficient set was\n\
    divided in to four and two parts and then max pooling was used to determine the\n\
    maximum value in these divided parts and the coefficient set as a whole.\nThese\n\
    maximum values were then concatenated together to form the seven valued output\n\
    from that coefficient set. Furthermore, the results for each coefficient set within\
    \ each\naxis were also concatenated to form the feature vector for a sensor axis\
    \ measurement.\nThis operation was performed for each axis of accelerometer and\
    \ groscope sensor\ndata with the final feature vector of 210 values consisting\
    \ of the concatenations of\nthe individual vectors for each axis. It is hypothesized\
    \ that this way local as well as\nglobal information at each level of the wavelet\
    \ coefficients can be captured. For the\nwavelet decomposition, tests were performed\
    \ with level values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and\nit was determined that level-4 produced\
    \ the best results.\nClassification\nA hierarchical classification approach is\
    \ employed to discriminate between the vari-\nous activities and falls considered\
    \ from the SisFall dataset. Hierarchical classification\ninvolves the division\
    \ of a complex taxonomic classification problem in to a set of\nsubsets that are\
    \ potentially easier to differentiate as the task becomes more localized.\nHierarchical\
    \ classifiers have been used in multiple different applications [478] where\n\
    they have been found to improve upon the performance of many flat classification\n\
    schemes. The classification framework used in this work combines hierarchical\
    \ clas-\nsification with a vote based system. The classification problem is divided\
    \ into three\nparts, each with its own classifier to indicate to the subclass\
    \ of the output. The clas-\n105\nMaxpooling Size = 4\nMaxpooling Size = 2\nMaxpooling\

    \ 1-D Spatial Pyramid Pooling.\nsifier in part one consists of differentiating\
    \ whether a given recording is a fall or one\nof the four considered ADLs. In\
    \ order to train this stage, the activities of Standing,\nWalking, Sitting and\
    \ Jogging along with all falls combined in to one class are passed\nto the classifier.\
    \ This dilutes the original ten-class problems in to a five-class sub\nproblem.\
    \ The output of this stage is the determination of whether a given recording\n\
    is either one of the four ADLs (Standing, Walking, Sitting or Jogging) or a fall.\
    \ If a\nrecording has been detected to be a fall, it is sent to the second and\
    \ third stages.\nThe second and third stages work in parallel on samples detected\
    \ as falls from\n106\nthe first stage in the form of a voting machine. These two\
    \ stages vote individually\non the direction and severity of the detected fall\
    \ samples. In order to train them,\nfall samples were relabeled to represent direction\
    \ and severity only and are fed to the\nclassifiers. For the direction, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a three-class\nproblem of determining fall directions\
    \ as being Forward, Backward or Lateral. For\nthe severity classifier, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a two-class problem\nof a fall being either Soft or\
    \ Hard. After a signal has passed through all necessary\nstages, the outputs of\
    \ the individual stages are combined to indicate to the activity\nor type of fall\
    \ being fed at the input.\nFour classifiers were tested for each part of the hierarchical\
    \ scheme, the classifiers\nconsidered were K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\
    \ Machines, Random Forests\nand eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Parameter tuning was\
    \ performed using gradient\nsearch for each classifier over a range of values\
    \ for each parameter.\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nCompared to the SVM which attempts\
    \ to create a deci-\nsion boundary between classes on a global level, the K-NN\
    \ algorithm operates locally.\nStarting from a data point, the 1 Nearest Neigbhor\
    \ algorithm will assign each new\nsample the class of its neighbor. However, using\
    \ a single neighborhood point to assign\nnew classes may lead to erroneous classes\
    \ being assigned. Therefore, typically mul-\ntiple neighboring points are used\
    \ to determine the label for a given point. In K-NN,\n’K’ represents the number\
    \ of points used in the neighborhood to assign labels to data\nsamples. Each considered\
    \ sample is assigned the majority label within a neighbor-\nhood of K points around\
    \ it. In this manner, the K-NN algorithm is successively able\nto create a decision\
    \ boundary separating the data in to the different output classes.\n2.8.2.3\n\
    Results\nThree experiments were performed in this section. The first was to choose\
    \ the best\nclassifier to use, once that was determined. experiments were conducted\
    \ to determine\nthe observation window size and different combination of sensor\
    \ modalities. We used\nthe weighted F1-score as our training metric due to the\
    \ imbalance in the samples\nof the different classes in the data. Moreover, for\
    \ evaluation purposes, we report on\nthe individual F1-scores for each output\
    \ class and provide discussions as necessary.\nFurthermore, for the best performing\
    \ results, the Precision and Recall and Specificity\nwere also specified. Specificity\
    \ can be calculated as given in Eq. 10. It is also called\nthe True Negative Rate\
    \ and indicates to a classifiers capability to correctly detect\nsamples which\
    \ don’t belong to a given class. These metrics have been computed on\na one versus\
    \ all basis.\nSpecificity =\nTrue Negative\nTrue Negative + False Positive\n(10)\n\
    The data after the feature extraction stage was split in to a train/test partition\n\
    based on a 75/25 ratio with a parameter grid being searched through to obtain\n\
    107\ntuning parameters for maximizing the weighted F1-score while using five-fold\
    \ cross\nvalidation.\nClassifier Selection\nThis test was conducted to determine\
    \ the best classifier to use for the proceeding\nexperiments of observation window\
    \ selection and sensor modality selection. Here,\nexperiments were performed for\
    \ the considered window durations for each activity\nand the classifier which\
    \ provided the best performance overall was chosen. The mean\nF1-scores for each\
    \ output class for each classifier are shown in Figure 22. It can be\nobserved\
    \ that in general K-NN and SVM perform better compared to the ensemble\nmodels,\
    \ the RFC and XGBoost. However, since the K-NN slightly outperforms the\nSVM in\
    \ eight of the ten considered classes, we choose K-NN as the classifier for this\n\
    framework.\nBHF\nBSF\nFHF\nFSF\nJ\nLHF\nLSF\nS\nSB\nW\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    \ Window Duration\nAn important consideration in working with activity recognition\
    \ systems is to de-\ntermine the appropriate observation window size for the analysis\
    \ of sensor signals\nto accomplish the ADL recognition/fall detection task. The\
    \ size of the observation\nwindow is important as a smaller observation window\
    \ increases the response time of\nthe activity recognition/fall detection system\
    \ and it can also impact the time taken\nin the computation of features. In order\
    \ to find the best observation window size,\nwe perform experiments using five\
    \ values, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds. The classification\nresults in terms of the\
    \ F1-score are presented in Table 41. For each case, samples\nof duration equal\
    \ to half of the observation window were extracted around the peak\nvalue of the\
    \ SMV. From the table, it can be observed that an observation window\n108\nof\
    \ size 3 seconds produces the best results for six out of the ten output classes.\
    \ It\nonly produces poorer results for the classes BHF, BSF and S, SB where window\
    \ sizes\nof 2 seconds, 6 seconds and 4 seconds respectively perform better than\
    \ the 3 second\nwindowing case. Upon further investigation of this phenomenon\
    \ using the result of\nother classifiers, it was observed that the activities\
    \ of (BHF and BHF) were best rec-\nognized by all the classifiers with a window\
    \ size of 2 seconds (for the case of K-NN,\nthere is a small difference between\
    \ the 2 second and 6 second case), for the other two\nactivities of S and SB too\
    \ the F1-score was obtained for the 4 second duration (for\nthe activity S, the\
    \ difference in performance over windows larger than 4 seconds is\nvery small).\
    \ This could be attributed to the feature aggregation process in the max\npooling\
    \ operation in the different spatial segments.\nTable 41. Performance for different\

    Sensor Modality\nThe second experiment in designing the proposed system is the\
    \ determination of\nthe best sensor modality to use.\nUsing a single sensor would\
    \ result in less data,\nfaster processing and reduced hardware costs compared\
    \ to the multisensor approach\ncombining accelerometer and gyroscope. To do this,\
    \ the classification framework was\ntested with 3 second windowed segments of\
    \ the combined acceleromter and gyroscope\ndata as well as data of the accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope sensors individually. The\nresults of this experiment are presented\
    \ in Table 42. It can be observed that using\na combination of both accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope data together produces the best\nresults for eight of the ten\
    \ output classes. An accelerometer-only system produces\nbetter results for the\
    \ detection of activity SB and the fall FHF. The outcome of this\nexperiment agrees\
    \ with previous work for fall detection by Waheed et. al. [436] on\nthe SisFall\
    \ dataset.\n2.8.2.4\nDiscussion\nTable 43 reports on the best results obtained\

    \ 43, the best recognized ADLs are W and J whereas the best rec-\nognized fall\
    \ is BSF. The worst performing class in ADLs is SB whereas the worst\nperforming\
    \ fall is LHF. Upon further inspection of the cause of the bad performance\nwith\
    \ LHF, looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that LHF was most\ncommonly\
    \ confused with FSF which resulted in a reduction of the classification per-\n\
    formance for this class. On the other hand, in the case of FSF (the second worse\n\
    performing class), looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that FSF was\n\
    confused with LSF and FHF. Furthermore, the specificity values indicate that there\n\
    has been very little mis-identification for each of the classes. When talking\
    \ about\nthe activity S, it was observed that samples from this activity were\
    \ confused with\nthe activity W which resulted in the sub-par performance of the\
    \ classifier for its\nrecognition.\n110\n2.8.3\nFall Detection with Severity and\
    \ Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using CNN-XGBoost\nThis section presents\
    \ a scheme for performing fall detection considering fall direction\nand severity\
    \ as well as activity recognition. Inertial sensor data taken from the SisFall\n\
    dataset is used to develop the methodology. Data pre-processing is first carried\
    \ out\nin terms of windowing and relabeling. Then, data augmentation is carried\
    \ out for\nclasses which do not have a sufficient number of samples. Lastly, feature\
    \ extraction is\nperformed along with classification. This work considers fall\
    \ and activity recognition\nas a holistic problem, in that different types of\
    \ falls and activities are considered\nthereby producing a more ’complete’ recognition\
    \ system for use in cyber-physical\nsystems. Moreover, towards this end, a CNN-XGBoost\
    \ combination is proposed.\n2.8.3.1\nMethodology\nThe proposed scheme follows\
    \ a typical deep learning so-\nlution framework. First, inertial sensor data from\
    \ the IMU sensors contained within\nthe SisFall dataset is pre-processed to extract\
    \ windowed segments, then data aug-\nmentation is performed for minority classes,\
    \ followed by feature extraction and then\nclassification. This has been illustrated\
    \ in Figure 23 and a discussion is provided for\neach of the steps in the proceeding\
    \ sections.\nData Pre-processing\nBefore the IMU sensor recordings can be used\
    \ for ADL and fall detection, raw sensor\nmeasurements need to be suitably processed.\
    \ In this experiment, data pre-processing\nconsists of two steps, the first is\
    \ the extraction of uniform sized windows as was\nperformed in the previous section\
    \ from the IMU recordings and the next is data\naugmentation. Since windowing\
    \ of the signals has already been discussed previously,\nonly data augmentation\
    \ is discussed here.\nData Augmentation\nThe use of deep learning methods require\
    \ a suitable\namount of data to be present for them to learn the data pattern\
    \ sufficiently well. Un-\nfortunately, due to the nature of the problem considered,\
    \ the relabeled data from the\nSisFall dataset contains a reduced amount of data\
    \ for some of the classes, especially\nfall classes and also for the ADL of Standing.\
    \ In order to alleviate this shortcom-\ning, data augmentation was employed to\
    \ increase the number of samples from these\nclasses. Three augmentations were\
    \ performed for each of the extracted recordings\nfor the classes SB, FHF, FSF,\
    \ BHF, BSF, LHFand LSF. These were the addition of\nnoise, scaling and resampling\
    \ after inerpolation [439]. For augmentation with noise,\nwhite gaussian noise\
    \ was added to the extracted windows of the considered classes.\nThe noise was\
    \ generated using a standard deviation equal to 0.01. The addition of\nthe noise\
    \ simulates measurement noise during recording which might be encountered\nwhen\
    \ IMU based fall detection systems are employed. For scale based augmentation,\n\
    the original extracted window was multiplied by a random number from the uniform\n\
    distribution between 0.8 and 1.2 thereby scaling it between 80% and 120% of its\
    \ orig-\ninal form. By doing so, changes in amplitude over the same type of activity/fall\
    \ are\nincorporated. This could indicate to a change in fixation (loosening etc)\
    \ of the sensing\n111\nPeak SMV Detection\nWindowing\nCNN\nXGBoost Classifier\n\

    \ different physique and subsequent fall intensity response.\nLastly, in order\
    \ to incorporate sampling inconsistencies, the windows are first upsam-\npled\
    \ and then downsampled. This was done by a scale of ten. With this strategy,\n\
    each from original window were produced three additional samples. An illustration\n\
    for the results of the augmentation process for an X-axis accelerometer measurement\n\
    for a lateral fall has been shown in Figure 24.\nFeature extraction\nThe aim of\
    \ feature extraction for a classification problem is to produce a representa-\n\
    tion of the input that can be better used to indicate to the output class. In\
    \ this regard,\nresearch in the area of fall detection with inertial sensors has\
    \ made use of different\ntypes of hand crafted features such as statistical, time\
    \ and frequency domain as well\nas wavelet transforms [479, 480, 481, 482]. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNNs\nor Covnets) are a set of neural networks developed following\
    \ the visual cortex within\nthe brain [483]. CNNs perform operations on inputs\
    \ by introducing convolutions of\n112\nFigure 24.\nIllustration of data augmentation.\n\
    (X component of Accelerometer,\nLateral Fall)\nseveral filters with learnable\
    \ weights to gauge the importance of each datapoint in\nthe input. These layers\
    \ containing the filters and to which the input is provided are\ncalled convolutional\
    \ layers. Through these learnable weights, CNNs are able to cap-\nture temporal\
    \ and spatial dependencies of the input. Moreover, using the same filters\nfor\
    \ different inputs reduces the number of parameters as the weights are reused.\
    \ This\nallows CNNs to develop a deeper understanding of the provided input compared\
    \ to\ntypical multilayer perceptron models. CNNs have revolutionized the field\
    \ of computer\nvision where they have been used for a variety of tasks such as\
    \ classification, object\ndetection, segmentation and object counting [484, 485]\
    \ and they have also successfully\nbeen used for applications within the speech\
    \ and other time series signal application\ndomain [486, 487, 488]. In this experiment,\
    \ rather than using hand crafted features\n113\nas in the previous experiments,\
    \ a CNN has been used to perform feature extraction\nin order to take advantage\
    \ of the spatial and temporal dependency capturing capa-\nbilities of CNNs. CNNs\
    \ are usually comprised of several convolutional (Conv) layers.\nWithin a multilayer\
    \ CNN, the earlier Conv layers capture low level features from the\ninput with\
    \ more complex features being computed by the successive layers. Also,\nCNNs may\
    \ employ pooling layers between convolutional layers so as to reduce the\nsize\
    \ of the input passed on to successive layers and therefore reduce computation.\n\
    The proposed network along with the XGBoost classification stage is illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 25.\nConv\n64 filters (3x1)\nConv\n64 filters (3x1)\nConv\n64 filters\

    XGB classification\nStage\nFigure 25. CNN Network for feature extraction and XGBoost\
    \ classification stage.\nAs seen from the figure, the network consists of four\
    \ Conv layers of 64 filters\neach.\nThese layers have filters of size 3x1 and\
    \ are used to extract features from\nraw inertial sensor measurements. Each Conv\
    \ layer is followed by a Relu activation\nfunction which applies a non-linearity\
    \ to the output of the Conv layers. To condense\nthe output of the first three\
    \ Conv layers, a pooling layer is utilized. Instead of max\npooling, average pooling\
    \ is used in this network. Max pooling picks out the largest\nvalue of the patch\
    \ of data being observed currently, in contrast, average pooling uses\nthe average\
    \ of the data being observed. Average pooling has been successfully used in\n\
    114\nplace of max pooling in a variety of scenarios [489, 490]. Normalization\
    \ is performed\nusing a batch normalization layer for each Conv layer. The output\
    \ of the last Conv\nlayer are feature maps derived from the input raw inertial\
    \ sensor measurements from\nboth the accelerometer and the gyroscope.\nClassification\n\
    Classification is carried out by using a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) clas-\n\
    sifier. The output from the CNN is first flattened and then provided as an input\
    \ to\nthe XGBoost stage. The parameters of the XGBoost classifier are tuned through\
    \ a\nparameter search over a range of values. We make use of an XGBoost classifier\
    \ due\nto its suitability for a large dimensional input which results from the\
    \ flattened CNN\noutput.\n2.8.3.2\nResults\nIn order to use the proposed CNN for\
    \ feature extraction, it must first be trained\naccordingly. In order to train\
    \ the network, a fully connected layer with a softmax\noutput was added as the\
    \ final stage to serve as the intermediate temporary output\ndeterminant stage.\
    \ The windowed data from the SisFall dataset was divided in to\nthree sets, train,\
    \ validation and test in a stratified manner. A learning rate of 0.01\nwas used\
    \ for the network with a batch size of 20 and the stochastic gradient descent\n\
    was used as the optimizer. Moreover, the metric chosen was the average of the\
    \ recall\nscores of all classes together, also called as the unweighted average\
    \ recall (UAR).\nThe recall is considered as one wants the system correctly classify\
    \ as many positive\nsamples for every class as possible. The final network was\
    \ determined using early\nstopping. The unweighted average recall (UAR) can be\
    \ computed as,\nUAR =\nk\nX\nn=0\n\x10\nTPn\nTPn+FNn\n\x11\nk\n(11)\nwhere k stands\
    \ for number of classes and TPn stands for the number of True\nPositive samples\
    \ in the nth class and FNn stands for number False Negative samples\nin the nth\
    \ class. Therefore, the average of the individual recall scores from all classes\n\
    was aimed to be maximized.\nData from the training set was provided to the CNN\
    \ network after performing data\naugmentation on the minority classes, during\
    \ training, the validation set was used\nto observe performance of the network\
    \ and determine the best performing instance.\nOnce training was finished, the\
    \ last fully connected classification layer was removed\nand replaced by an XGBoost\
    \ classification stage. To train the XGBoost stage, the\nweights of the final\
    \ best performing CNN model were loaded in to CNN layers of\nthe network and input\
    \ samples were then passed through them as before. Using the\noutput of the CNN\
    \ stage as an input for the XGBoost, a search was then carried\nout to determine\
    \ the optimal parameter values. After training of the XGBoost stage,\nthe completely\
    \ trained CNN-XGBoost model was tested using the test set.\nTwo\n115\nsets of\
    \ tests were performed, one while considering all ADLs as a single class versus\n\
    individual falls and the other considering common individual ADLs and individual\n\
    falls.\nOne ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all ADLs present in the\
    \ SisFall dataset were combined in to one\nclass to build a generic ADL versus\
    \ fall system. The results are presented in Table 44.\nIt can be observed from\
    \ the table that the ADL class has been detected with perfect\nrecall score. Among\

    \ From Table 45,\nwhen looking at the recall achieved for the individual activities,\
    \ it can be observed\nthat the best recognized activities are W and J with each\
    \ achieving a recall of around\n97%. The worst performance in terms of ADLs was\
    \ achieved for the activity SB for\nwhich a recall of 83.78% was attained. Considering\
    \ the case of falls, out of the six\nfalls, the worst recall score of 75% was\
    \ achieved for BHF and LHF whereas the best\nrecall score was of 95.83% was achieved\
    \ for BSF and LSF. The fall class FSF was also\n116\nnot identified well, achieving\
    \ a recall score of 77.08%. Furthermore, as observed from\nthe table, a high value\
    \ of specificity was obtained for all ADLs and falls indicating\nto correct determination\
    \ of negative samples for each class as well. Investigating the\nperformance of\
    \ the network from the confusion matrix, it was observed that the worst\nperforming\
    \ activity SB was equally confused as S and W, this can be attributed to\nthe\
    \ fact that the SB activity includes slight bending which could lead to confusion\
    \ for\nthe classifier. For the worst performing falls, it was observed that BHF\
    \ was confused\nwith LHF and LSF whereas LHF was confused with FHF and FSF. The\
    \ confusion\nbetween the falls is apparent from plots shown in Appendix A where\
    \ BHF has very\nsimilar accelerometer signal values to these classes.\n2.8.3.3\n\
    Discussion\nInorder to better understand the performance of the network for the\
    \ various fall\ndetection types from Tables 44 and 45, the performance of the\
    \ network for fall severity\nhas been illustrated in Figure 26. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls are better detected\ncompared to hard falls with UARs for the\
    \ individual ADL and fall experiment being\n79.63% for hard falls and that for\
    \ soft falls is 89.58%. For the one ADL and individual\nfall experiment, the difference\
    \ is less stark, being 85.18% for hard falls and 88.88%\nfor soft falls.\n60\n\

    network\nThis section presents a discussion on fall detection with severity and\
    \ direction along\nwith ADL recognition on the SisFall and the K-Fall datasets.\
    \ Two experiments were\nconducted in this regard, one with all ADLs as one class\
    \ versus the six fall types\nconsidered and another for individual ADLs and falls.\n\
    2.8.4.1\nData Labeling\nSince this experiment also uses the K-Fall dataset, the\
    \ labeling scheme for K-Fall\nis shown in Table 48. The labeling for the SisFall\
    \ dataset was retained the same\nfor the individual ADL and fall experiment.\n\
    However, for the one ADL and fall\nexperiment, all activities were labeled as\
    \ a single class ADL.\n2.8.4.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology consists of the two\
    \ steps of data preprocessing and classifi-\ncation. Data preprocessing has been\
    \ performed in the same manner as in section\n2.8.3.1. Therefore, this section\
    \ focuses on the ConvLSTM network used. The net-\nwork used in this work is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 28. It consists of four layers, the first\nof these is the ConvLSTM\
    \ layer. The ConvLSTM layer combines the properties of\nsequential learning associated\
    \ with LSTMs with the feature extraction capabilities\nof convolutional neural\
    \ networks and they have found successful use in the human\nactivity recognition/fall\
    \ detection domain [491, 492]. By replacing the simple matrix\nmultiplication\
    \ within LSTM cells by a convolutional operation, the ConvLSTM can\ncapture spatio-temporal\
    \ dependencies as opposed to the temporal only qualities of-\nfered by LSTMs.\
    \ Such spatial information is useful for the problem of fall detection\nwhere\
    \ not only the sequence contained within the recordings is important but also\n\
    the spatial information is also important to determine things like direction for\
    \ e.g.\nThe ConvLSTM layer is followed by a Self-Attention layer to incorporate\
    \ attention\n119\nTable 48. Labeling for K-Fall Dataset\nActivity Code\nAssigned\

    mechanism. Through the attention layer, important parts in the signal which can\n\
    help to determine the output class correctly are identified. For the current work,\
    \ a\nglobal attention mechanism which looks at the complete sequence is used.\
    \ After the\nattention layer follow two fully connected layers, one with a relu\
    \ activation function\nand the other with a softmax function to determine the\
    \ output class.\n2.8.4.3\nResults\nTwo experiments were performed in total on\
    \ the two datasets considered. The\nexperiments consisted of a fall vs ADL scenario\
    \ and another scenario in which ADLs\nwere conisdered individually to provide\
    \ a combined fall and ADL recognition system.\nThe results for each of the experiments\
    \ have been presented in this section. The\nnetwork was trained using an Adam\
    \ optimizer for 40 epochs with early stopping\nbeing used to retain the best performing\
    \ model before running it on the test set.\nAlso, during training, the network\
    \ was tasked to maximize the average recall of all\nclasses combined to ensure\
    \ that positive samples of each class were prioritized for\ncorrect detection,\
    \ however, in addition to recall, the precision, specificity and F1-\nscore have\
    \ also been reported in the results presented for the sake of completeness.\n\
    One ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all the ADLs were considered\
    \ a single class while the categories for\nfalls were retained as per individual\
    \ directions and severity levels. Table 49 presents\nthe results for this experiment\
    \ with the SisFall dataset for which an average recall of\n90.02% was achieved.\
    \ It can be observed that the network is able to determine ADLs\nvery well achieving\

    \ ADLs in\nthis case have been detected very well, resulting in a recall of 99.72%.\
    \ Considering the\nperformance of falls, the best performing fall classes were\
    \ BSF and LSF for which a\nrecall of 96% was achieved. The worst performing fall\
    \ class in this case was FSF with\na recall of 85%.\nIndividual ADL vs Individual\
    \ Falls\nIn this experiment, individual ADLs were considered as separate classes\
    \ in addition\nto the six fall classes mentioned before. This exercise was carried\
    \ out to assess the\ndesigned systems performance as a combined ADL recognition\
    \ and fall detection\nsystem. The result for the SisFall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table 51. The average\nrecall achieved for this experiment using the SisFall\
    \ dataset is 91.49%.\nConsidering fall performance, it can be observed from Table\
    \ 51 that the class\nBSF is the best recognized fall, having a recall of 94.74%\
    \ with the fall LHF being\nthe worst recognized one with a recall of 73.68%. The\
    \ best recognized ADL is the\nclass W with a near perfect recall of 99.06%. The\
    \ worst recognized ADL is S with\n96.98% which is not a large difference compared\

    \ dataset is\nSB with a recall of 97.5% with the worst being the class J.\n2.8.4.4\n\
    Discussion\nWhen comparing the performance of ADLs and falls overall for both\
    \ experiments,\nit can be observed that ADL recognition performance was much better\
    \ than the\nperformance for fall detection. For both experiments conducted, when\
    \ comparing the\nperformance of the network across datasets, the network performs\
    \ better on the K-Fall\ndataset compared to the SisFall dataset. This could be\
    \ attributed to the difference\nin the volunteer make up of the participants as\
    \ K-Fall mostly had young people\nvolunteering to perform falls whereas SisFall\
    \ contains a wide variety of age groups\nand gender make up in its volunteers.\
    \ To gather further insights in to the performance\nof the network in terms of\
    \ fall detection for the two experiments conducted across both\ndatasets, Figure\
    \ 29 illustrates the networks performance for falls for both datasets\nand experiments.\
    \ An average recall of 88.37% was achieved for the SisFall dataset\nand 91.49%\
    \ for the K-Fall dataset for the one ADL vs individual falls experiment\nand 88.57%\
    \ and 91.33% respectively for the individual ADL and individual falls\nexperiment.\
    \ It can be observed that the classes LSF, FHF and BSF were recognized\nvery well,\
    \ each achieving a recall of nearly 90% or higher. The class FHF was also\ndetected\
    \ sufficiently well, achieving an average recall of more than 86% across all\n\
    experiments. For SisFall, the least performing class was LHF and for K-Fall it\
    \ was\nBHF.\nFigure 30 investigates the performance of the network when considering\
    \ different\nfall severity levels for all the experiments. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls have\nbeen consistently better recognized compared to hard falls.\
    \ This difference is largest\n(6%) when individual ADLs are considered as separate\
    \ classes for both datasets. For\nthe experiment where ADLs are grouped in to\
    \ a single class, there is only a slight\n123\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n\

    99.87\n96.56\nonly detection system that considers the direction as well as the\
    \ severity of falls was\npresented. Inertial measurement sensor data from a publicly\
    \ available dataset was\nused to carry out this task. Following a typical machine\
    \ learning pipeline, the data\nwas first preprocessed by extracting equal duration\
    \ segments from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor signals based on the acceleration\
    \ magnitude. This is followed\nby the computation of various time and frequency\
    \ domain features for each of these\nsegments. The next step is feature selection\
    \ and classification which is performed by\nusing four different machine learning\
    \ algorithms popular in fall detection systems.\nFirst, a baseline performance\
    \ is established and then feature reduction is performed\naiming to maintain or\
    \ improve algorithm performance by elimination of redundant\nfeatures. It was\
    \ observed that the weighted F1-score improved slightly (by just over\n1%) for\
    \ both experiments.\nThe other three experiments considered activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection\nsimultaneously. For the second experiment, utilizing\
    \ inertial sensor data, a hierarchi-\ncal classification framework using wavelets\
    \ and adaptive pooling was presented. To\nachieve this, inertial sensor recordings\
    \ (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the Sis-\nFall dataset were utilized and\
    \ windowed segments were extracted from each recording.\nFollowing this, a level-4\
    \ haar wavelet was used to extract wavelet coefficients from\nthese windowed segments\
    \ and then 4-2-1 1-D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used to\n126\nsummarize the output\
    \ of the wavelet feature coefficients at each approximation and\ndetail level\
    \ before the max pooled coefficients were concatenated to form the final\nfeature\
    \ vector. A hierarchical classification scheme was then used consisting of three\n\
    classification stages, one for determining individual ADLs versus a generic fall\
    \ and the\nsecond and third for fall direction and severity respectively with\
    \ both voting together\nto determine the severity and direction of a fall. Towards\
    \ this end, experiments were\nconducted to determine the most appropriate size\
    \ of the observation window as well as\nsensing modality used. It was found that\
    \ for the proposed setup, a window duration\nof 3 seconds produced the best results\
    \ while using data from both the accelerometer\nand gyroscope. In the third experiment,\
    \ Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer\nand gyroscope) data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset is first windowed into non-overlapping\nsegments of duration 3 seconds.\
    \ After suitable data augmentation for the minority\nclasses, the windowed segments\
    \ are passed to a Convolutional Neural Network for\nfeature extraction. The CNN\
    \ is trained to maximize the unweighted average recall\nfor the validation partition.\
    \ Once the CNN is trained, an XGBoost last stage is used\nfor classification.\
    \ Experiments conducted on the test set achieve an unweighted aver-\nage recall\
    \ of 88% for both the one ADL versus individual falls and individual ADLs\nversus\
    \ fall experiments. In comparison with other techniques used for this task, the\n\
    proposed scheme produces sufficiently better results, thereby demonstrating the\
    \ effi-\ncacy of the proposed method. Lastly, a ConvLSTM network with attention\
    \ has been\nused for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\
    \ Using data from the\nSisFall and the K-Fall datasets, two experiments were conducted\
    \ on inertial sensor\ndata. The first considered falls versus ADLs and the other\
    \ combined ADL recognition\nand fall detection. Results for both experiments achieved\
    \ an average recall of more\nthan 90%. The results from the cross-dataset performance\
    \ indicate to the robustness\nof the designed methodology.\nTable 55 presents\
    \ the F-1 scores for the four experiments considering fall detection\nwith direction\
    \ and severity for the SisFall dataset. For experiment 1, only the fall\ndetection\
    \ with direction and severity part has been reported. A progression can be\nobserved\
    \ in the detection of falls wherein an increase of nearly 8.5% in the average\n\
    F1-score was achieved.\n127\nCHAPTER VI\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n1\nConclusion\n\
    This dissertation provided a coverage of the use of Internet of Things towards\
    \ the\ndevelopment of smart communities. While doing so, the main applications\
    \ of ML/DL\nalgorithms as well as optimization algorithms were discussed and mapped.\
    \ Further-\nemore, other technological components of the IoT such as sensing,\
    \ communication,\nsecurity and privacy were also talked about. Lastly, considering\
    \ the case of smart\nhealth, specifically fall detection, experimentation and\
    \ analysis was conducted and\nthe results presented.\nIn this regard, the usage\
    \ of inertial sensor data has been very popular as they do\nnot restrict a users\
    \ movement and are also easy to deploy compared to other methods.\nFour approaches\
    \ that considered fall detection with direction and severity were pre-\nsented.\
    \ In this regard, four experiments were conducted, first was the development\n\
    of a fall only detection system whereas the other three were for a combined ADL\
    \ and\nfall system. For the other three experiments, a hierarchical and two deep\
    \ learning\nbased approaches were tested. The designed methodologies were compared\
    \ to the\nstate of the art and were found to outperform them.\n2\nContribution\n\
    The Internet of Things has spearheaded tremendous change in society by allowing\
    \ for\ncapturing measurements in different facets of our daily lives. With such\
    \ a fundamental\nimpact being made, it is pertinent that researchers commit to\
    \ analyzing the current\npenetration that IoT possesses in city operation and\
    \ also providing impetuses for\nnew and novel application development. This work\
    \ aims to address these needs by\ndiscussing the use and role of the internet\
    \ of things in smart communities.\nThe\ncontribution of the work are as follows:\n\
    1. Provide a coverage of the IoT based smart city ecosystem in terms of the tech-\n\
    nologies utilized. Discussion has been provided about the sensors, communi-\n\
    cation technologies as well as the IoT architectures that enable IoT smart city\n\
    development. Finally a review of the security and privacy issues was also dis-\n\
    cussed.\n2. Present a study of the uses of ML and DL methods for different applications\
    \ of\nsmart cities in an IoT context. To this end, the type of architecture employed\n\
    and the data source type were also covered.\n128\n3. The use of optimization algorithms\
    \ in IoT smart cities has been provided. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is\
    \ the first comprehensive review of optimization\nalgorithms in IoT Smart Cities.\n\
    4. Considering the case of smart health, methodologies have been devised for the\n\
    novel case of fall detection with direction and severity detection. In this respect,\n\
    the performance time, frequency domain and statistical features on inertial\n\
    sensor data has been analyzed and presented.\n5. A combined activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection framework with fall di-\nrection and severity consideration\
    \ has been discussed.\nFour approaches in\nthis regard have been presented, one\
    \ utilizing time-frequency information us-\ning wavelets along with a hierarchical\
    \ classification scheme, third a Convolu-\ntional Neural Network-eXtreme Gradient\
    \ Boost combination and the last being\na ConvLSTM has been proposed. The proposed\
    \ approaches has been shown to\noutperform the state of the art in the field.\n\
    3\nFuture Work\nThe IoT is revolutionizing development of smart city applications.\
    \ There are several\nopportunities. Some of these are listed below:\n• IoT Systems\
    \ for Smart Cities\n– A major research area is in the security and privacy of\
    \ IoT in smart cities in\nterms of encryption techniques, authentication protocols,\
    \ data anonymiza-\ntion techniques and other methods to prevent unvalidated access\
    \ to the IoT\nnetwork. As mentioned before technologies such as blockchain could\
    \ help\nintroduce access tracking and control, secure device discovery, prevention\n\
    of spoofing, data loss while ensuring that end to end encryption is also\nused.\n\
    – Of the data transfer standards developed till now for IoT, many are not\ncompatible\
    \ with each other. Work needs to be carried out in this regard to\nenable intercommunication\
    \ of sensor nodes using different protocols while\nutilizing low power, which\
    \ is imperative for sensor nodes in the network.\n– Another area to work on, is\
    \ the development of efficient storage techniques\nand low power hardware which\
    \ can reduce operational costs. From a de-\nployment perspective, decentralized\
    \ systems have been proposed as the\nbest solutions to increase reliability of\
    \ the application. Techniques such as\nfederated learning allow for decentralized\
    \ DL system deployments.\n• AI/Combinatorial Optimization in IoT Smart Cities\n\
    – The development of data fusion techniques that can make the use of het-\nerogeneous\
    \ data sources easier, intelligent data reduction/feature selection\nmethods to\
    \ ensure that redundant or ’uninteresting’ data is not part of the\n129\nAI development\
    \ pipeline. This will help in a quicker turnaround time as\nwell as improved performance\
    \ of deployments. Current methods need to be\nused as well as new ones be researched\
    \ for making ML and DL algorithms\nmore explainable to suit the various applications\
    \ in a smart city.\n– Hybrid and novel optimization methodologies (for e.g. graywolf\
    \ optimiza-\ntion [493]) which combine characteristics of multiple heuristic schemes\n\
    could potentially outperform singular methodologies.\nThere have been\nseveral\
    \ works which combine multiple optimization techniques.\n– Reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) has the potential to provide solutions to com-\nbinatorial optimization\
    \ problems as covered in [494]. The idea is to use\nmachine learning and reinforcement\
    \ learning to get rid of human created\nheurists which may lead to optimizations\
    \ towards local optimums. Agents\ncan be trained to search for these heuristics\
    \ to automate the process.\n• Smart Health: Fall detection\n– The addition of\
    \ additional sensor modalities apart from intertial sensor\nmeasurements might\
    \ help improve performance for the worst detected\nclasses from the experiments\
    \ conducted. Various authors have incorpo-\nrated medical or pressure sensors\
    \ in their fall detection systems.\nData\nfrom these sensors can be used together\
    \ as an input to a deep learning\nnetwork. This additional information gathered\
    \ for subjects while under-\ngoing a fall could also describe valuable health\
    \ parameters that can be used\nfor diagnosis or early detection of ailments which\
    \ might be the underlying\ncause of falls.\n– Another work opportunity in the\
    \ data science domain would be the as-\nsessment of this problem considering a\
    \ data centric approach, where, in\ncontrast to a model centric approach where\
    \ the focus is on developing the\nbest model, data centric focuses on working\
    \ with data to improve applica-\ntion performance using systematic procedures\
    \ for labeling, augmentation\netc. Such systematic procedures and qualitative\
    \ data analysis would aid\nin cross-dataset algorithm deployment as well.\n130\n\

    \ in-depth contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), cov-\nering\
    \ the fundamental concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols,\
    \ and performance\noptimization techniques via a systematic survey and synthesis\
    \ of the related literature. The negative\nimpacts of climate change and the increasing\
    \ global population on food security and unemployment\nthreats have motivated\
    \ the adoption of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an\nindispensable\
    \ underlying technology in precision agriculture and greenhouses to improve food\n\
    production capacities and quality. However, most related Agri-IoT testbed solutions\
    \ have failed to\nachieve their performance expectations due to the lack of an\
    \ in-depth and contextualized reference\ntutorial that provides a holistic overview\
    \ of communication technologies, routing architectures, and\nperformance optimization\
    \ modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although IoT applications\nare\
    \ founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT) varies based on the\
    \ speciﬁc performance\nand user expectations as well as technological, architectural,\
    \ and deployment requirements. Likewise,\nthe agricultural setting is a unique\
    \ and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not\napply, hence the\
    \ need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these via the\
    \ following\ncontributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts,\
    \ technologies, and architectural\nstandards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the technical design requirements of a robust,\nlocation-independent, and\
    \ affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking\nfault-tolerance\
    \ techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control (MAC)\n\
    protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth case\
    \ study on how to\ndesign a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, affordable, adaptive,\
    \ stable, autonomous, and cluster-based\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\
    \ taxonomy of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics\nthat can guarantee an\
    \ optimized network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new\n\
    taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\nnetworks and a three-tier objective framework with remedial\
    \ measures for designing an efﬁcient\nassociated supervisory protocol for cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks.\nKeywords: Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE); cluster-based Agricultural\
    \ IoT (CA-IoT); fault management\n(FM); multi-objective optimization (MOO); wireless\
    \ sensor network-based Agricultural IoT (WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT)\n1. Introduction\

    \ tutorials have been authored on this subject, they present\nmere classifications\
    \ of communications trends on classical IoT [2,5–8] without any context-\nspecific\
    \ technical considerations of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For\
    \ instance,\nthe authors in [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure,\
    \ platforms, standards,\ndevelopment trends, and possible network solutions in\
    \ agriculture. Similarly, the roles of\nindustrial IoT (thus, identification-based\
    \ IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR codes [5],\nbarcodes) and communication-based\
    \ IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave [6], MQTT [5,6],\nLoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE\
    \ [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field Communication (NFC) [5],\nand power\
    \ line area network) were reviewed in terms of current research trends, applications,\n\
    and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition\n\
    capacities, the authors concluded that WSN technology is more energy-efficient\
    \ and suitable\nfor Agri-IoT than the costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT\
    \ technology has not\nyielded its intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to several technical\nchallenges that have not received adequate\
    \ contextual research considerations [14]:\n1.\nThe agricultural setting is a\
    \ unique area where conventional IoT technologies do\nnot apply. Existing Agri-IoT\
    \ solutions are location-restricted because they are mostly\nbased on Wi-Fi or\
    \ cellular communication technologies and electricity grids with\nconstrained\
    \ coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting lacks access\nto\
    \ reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based technologies,\
    \ and the\nintended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income earners\
    \ with limited\ntechnological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly utilize\
    \ architecture-\nrestricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,\
    \ routing over low-power\nand lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication\
    \ standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Zig-\nBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE))\
    \ [15], which are difﬁcult to access\nin typical African farms. Consequently,\
    \ Agri-IoT users in Africa expect a context-\nrelevant solution that is affordable,\
    \ simple to deploy and operate by non-experts,\nlocation-unrestricted, supportive\
    \ of large-scale farm management, and based on freely\navailable technologies\
    \ that do not require licensing. Thus, they are unlike popular IoT\nuse cases\
    \ such as medical, vehicular, and industrial IoT, whose designs are mainly\naffected\
    \ by critical factors including security, stable connectivity, and interference,\n\
    respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on affordable battery-powered SNs,\
    \ which\nmake architecture, low-power communication technology, power optimization,\
    \ cost,\nfault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability, and environmental impact\
    \ critical design\nfactors in order to address its resource or deployment-induced\
    \ challenges [12,16,17].\n2.\nHigh susceptibility to faults and failures: Agri-IoT\
    \ networks are vulnerable to faults\nand failures since the resource-constrained\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in hostile envi-\nronments to autonomously operate\
    \ via a network supervisory protocol with limited\npost-deployment maintenance\
    \ services. This supervisory protocol must incorporate\nsufﬁcient power optimization,\
    \ auto-fault management (FM), and self-adaptability\ntechniques in order to achieve\
    \ the desired performance expectation. Due to the lack of\nan in-depth and context-relevant\
    \ tutorial that bridges the gap between theoretical tax-\nonomies and real-world\
    \ designs, most canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those\nauthored in [1,10,11,17–20],\
    \ suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments.\n3.\nAgri-IoT technology\
    \ lacks comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN de-\nsign to ﬁeld deployment.\n\
    The power- and resource-constrained SNs that form\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT network\
    \ in the aforementioned context require limited\ndata transmission rates, computational\
    \ capabilities, memory capacities, commu-\nnication distance, and operational\
    \ stability. Consequently, the associated routing\nprotocol [9,12,17,21], communication\
    \ technology, and routing architecture [22–24]\nmust support mechanisms that ensure\
    \ packet size and communication distance mod-\neration [16], efﬁcient channel\
    \ access management (CAM), and SN’s tasks manage-\nment. It is not a mere application\
    \ of conventional IoT to a farm, as many authors\nattempted [1,10–12,17–20,23,25,26],\
    \ which lacked application-speciﬁc requirements\nsuch as dense network inter-connectivity,\
    \ higher information perceptibility, compre-\nIoT 2023, 4\n268\nhensive intelligence\
    \ services, remote monitoring, smart decision making, and the\nexecution of precise\
    \ control/actuation actions on the farm.\n4.\nSuperﬁcial consideration of desired\
    \ communication technologies of Agri-IoT with-\nout considering the cluster-based\
    \ architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related surveys and\ntutorials focused on high-power-demanding\
    \ communication technologies (Wi-Fi and\ncellular-based technologies), the centralized\
    \ architecture-constrained ZigBee standard,\nand the operation principles of conventional\
    \ IoT as authored in [1,10,11,14,18,19]\nwithout an in-depth consideration of\
    \ the unique case of Agri-IoT. It is well estab-\nlished that the cluster-based\
    \ architecture is the best candidate for Agri-IoT applica-\ntion [12,16,17,24];\
    \ however, there are no systematic evaluations to cement this fact.\nFor instance,\
    \ most benchmarking WSN-based IoT testbed solutions are founded on the\nZigBee\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi,\ncellular-based,\
    \ and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards. These standards also thrive on\nwired or\
    \ ﬁxed IP-based infrastructural backbones, total Internet/electricity coverage,\n\
    and highly complex graph-based and centralized routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19],\n\
    leading to a lack of global signiﬁcance because Africa, which is the focus of\
    \ this study,\nhas less than 50% electricity/Internet coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee,\
    \ Wi-Fi and cellular-\nbased communication technologies with centralized or ﬂooding-based\
    \ routing archi-\ntecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive, complex to\
    \ manage, location-restricted,\nenergy-inefﬁcient, and over-reliant on ﬁxed supporting\
    \ infrastructure. Therefore,\nan in-depth contextual assessment of how low-power\
    \ communication standards such\nas LoRa, SigFox, and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT\n(CA-IoT) networks can be of immeasurable beneﬁts\
    \ to the IoT community and farmers.\n5.\nThe role of Agri-IoT in eliminating food\
    \ insecurity, improving crop quality, alle-\nviating global poverty, and increasing\
    \ agricultural production volumes has been\nunderestimated [2,7,8,10,16,28,29].\
    \ The agricultural sector, which has been hindered\nby climate change, is the\
    \ largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT\nhas emerged\
    \ with the most promising opportunities to address food and employ-\nment insecurity\
    \ issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the\nfarmers. However,\
    \ these beneﬁts have not been fully realized due to insufﬁcient\nresearch publicity.\n\
    To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufﬁciently\
    \ consid-\nered these technical issues and provided sufﬁcient technical guidelines\
    \ for the designers of\nAgri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order\
    \ to achieve satisfactory network\nperformance. Additional realistic research\
    \ is needed regarding the contextual evaluation\nof SN design and deployment factors,\
    \ fundamental network design concepts and require-\nments, multi-objective optimization\
    \ (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the\nassociated routing protocol,\
    \ and efﬁcient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the\nAgri-IoT using\
    \ the cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibil-\n\
    ity of using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such\
    \ as BLE\nvia cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less,\
    \ cheaper, energy-\nefﬁcient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network\
    \ is imperative. Furthermore,\na broader contextual overview covering all vital\
    \ aspects such as the fundamental concepts\nof Agri-IoT, technical design requirements\
    \ of SNs and WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the\nbenchmarking communication standards,\
    \ routing protocols, and testbed solutions, and an\nin-depth case study on how\
    \ to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, adaptive, and CA-IoT\nbased on the\
    \ performance and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a refer-\n\
    ence document can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model\
    \ and\noptimize the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between\
    \ the simu-\nlated networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can\
    \ be addressed. By way of\naddressing these technical challenges, this tutorial\
    \ presents the following contributions:\n•\nPerform an in-depth synthesis and\
    \ review (1) the basic concepts of Agri-IoT, (2) the\ncomprehensive design considerations\
    \ of these networks, (3) the technical design re-\nIoT 2023, 4\n269\nquirements\

    taxonomy of routing architectures, and deﬁne appropriate routing paradigms for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT using the core PHY layer design metrics: affordability, self-\n\
    healing capacity, energy-efﬁciency, location independence, and network adaptability.\n\
    •\nSystematic synthesis of canon cluster-based routing protocols to uncover the\
    \ plethora\nof possible research gaps, derive a realistic taxonomy of MOO metrics\

    \ designers to build adaptive, robust, fault-tolerant, energy-efﬁcient, affordable,\n\
    and optimized CA-IoT networks in both simulation and real-world implementations.\n\
    Overall, this tutorial is motivated to provide a contextualized, in-depth understanding\n\
    of this technology and assist the reader in designing robust, affordable, and\
    \ optimized Agri-\nIoT networks that can act as reliable game-changers to avert\
    \ the stipulated challenges. Also,\nthe critical design, deployment, and QoS requirements\
    \ of WSN-based Agri-IoT networks\nfrom theoretical modeling to real-world deployment\
    \ are unveiled in order to bridge the\nexisting gap between the theory and practice\
    \ of this technology [1,14].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized into the\
    \ following sections: Section 2\nprovides a brief background comparative overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT technologies,\nwhile Section 3 focuses on their components,\
    \ protocols, architectural layers, and proposed\narchitectural layers for WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT technology. Section 4 presents the detailed\ncontextual design and\
    \ implementation requirements of Agri-IoT networks, while Section V\ndeduces the\
    \ unique characteristics, challenges, and proposed performance expectations of\n\
    the associated routing protocols for the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. Sections 6–8\
    \ present\nsystematic surveys on routing protocols, FM techniques, and the canon\
    \ real-world testbed\nimplementations of WSN-based Agri-IoT solutions. Section\
    \ 9 examines how the above\ndiscussions have evolved using a case study of cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) for precision\nirrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and\
    \ future works, while Section 11 concludes\nthe paper.\n1.1. Comparative Overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT Technologies\nA comparative overview of the underlying\
    \ technologies (i.e., WSN, IoT, and Agri-\nIoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT\
    \ are compared from the perspective of architectural\nvariations, users’ expectations,\
    \ and design and implementational differences in Table 1.\nAs depicted in Figure\
    \ 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,\nresource-constrained\
    \ SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled data\nto a BS\
    \ for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily requiring\n\
    the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway, and\
    \ the\nevent sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.\
    \ A node\nmay route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location\
    \ and assigned\ntasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution\
    \ of the actuation actions.\nAlthough the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,\
    \ they constitute the\ninevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying\
    \ innovation of the WSN-based\nAgri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists\
    \ of IoT devices that sense and transmit\ntheir sampled information directly or\
    \ via telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-\ntracking purposes, mostly\
    \ via the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT\ndevices can\
    \ connect to the Internet/IoT cloud via ﬁxed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE\n\
    cellular/mobile networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions.\n\

    The main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure\
    \ 3\nand Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the ﬁeld-deployed SNs or IoT\
    \ devices),\na base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers,\
    \ and the user’s monitor-\ning/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g.,\
    \ SNs and BS) in Agri-IoT are mostly\nbattery-powered and must be equipped with\
    \ sensing, computing, and communication\nabilities to form infrastructure-less,\
    \ robust, self-healing, and self-conﬁgured WSNs for data\ncollection and event\
    \ management [33]. The core units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS\nare compared\
    \ and contrasted in Table 2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT\n\
    devices can sense, process, and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet\
    \ or IoT\ncloud without a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform\
    \ likewise via\na BS. This resource-sufﬁcient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user\
    \ and the WSN or\nactuator control system. It can also process the received data\
    \ and locally execute actionable\ndecisions via the actuator of the farm event\
    \ being monitored. The received data can also be\nrelayed to the analytical data\
    \ engines in the IoT cloud via a wired and wireless medium for\nfurther processing\
    \ and actions [13]. The resource-constrained WSN sublayer mainly uses\ndata-centric\
    \ protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment densities, high network dynamics,\n\
    and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric protocols are fragile and\
    \ not\nstandardized, they are more suitable than the high resource-demanding ID-based\
    \ IPv4 or\nIPv6 protocols in the addressing space of the WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n\

    \ WSN and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm\nmanagement systems\
    \ to achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring\nand control.\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud\nservers,\
    \ and the remote interface application, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 5. Uniquely,\n\
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication\n\
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].\
    \ Also,\nmost Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between\
    \ the BS/gateway\nand the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database\
    \ and receives ac-\ntionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical\
    \ decision results for\nactuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most\
    \ dominant technology in the global\nsmart farming use cases in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT application, which are\
    \ frequently supervised by the associated routing protocol,\ninclude network construction/management,\
    \ data sensing, data processing/aggregation,\nfault tolerance, and communication\
    \ [9,12]. Also, the routing architecture must be supported\nby the associated\

    \ WSN-based\nAgri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure\
    \ 2.\n1.2. Classiﬁcations of IoT Applications and Speciﬁc Roles of Agri-IoT\n\
    Generally, IoT technology is application-speciﬁc. However, it has limitless applications\n\
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based\
    \ IoT sys-\ntems can be broadly classiﬁed into condition monitoring and event-tracking\
    \ categories [34],\nas illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe monitoring-based applications\
    \ involve real-time event data collection and analysis,\nsupervision, and operational\
    \ control of systems. In contrast, tracking-based applications\ntrack changes\
    \ in the phenomenon of interest, such as the locations of objects, persons,\n\
    transported goods, animals, and vehicles. Both application domains can be subdivided\n\
    into industrial, environmental, and societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where\
    \ speciﬁc\nexamples are provided for each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based\
    \ ap-\nplications may include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial\
    \ process\nmonitoring [5,29], process control [2], greenhouse automation [7],\
    \ precision agriculture\n(e.g., irrigation management, crop disease prediction,\
    \ prediction of production quality,\nIoT 2023, 4\n274\nand pest and disease control)\
    \ [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid net-\nwork monitoring/control\
    \ [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth. Conversely,\nspecific\
    \ examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat tracking, traffic\
    \ tracking,\nplant/animal condition tracking, and military target tracking, as\
    \ outlined in Figure 6.\n1/21/22, 10:55 AM\n701.svg\nEcology: Wildlife Tracking\n\

    \ \nFigure 6. Generalized taxonomy of IoT applications.\n1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and\
    \ Use-Cases\nThe concept of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data\
    \ processing/planning,\nand smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies,\
    \ big data, and cloud computing\ntechniques to provide proﬁtable solutions, as\
    \ presented in Figure 7. These principal roles\nin Figure 7 deﬁne their use cases.\
    \ For instance, monitoring the state of crops or the\nclimate of the ﬁeld using\
    \ Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers to know precisely the\namount of pesticides,\
    \ water, and fertilizers required to attain optimal crop quality and\nproduction\
    \ volume. However, the QoS requirements, the routing techniques, architectural\n\
    requirements, and the operational dynamics differ from one use case to another.\
    \ This\ntutorial focused on the critical and unique design requirements of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT,\nwhich is the backbone of the smart agricultural initiative [35].\
    \ The resulting use-cases in\nFigure 7 can be explained as follows:\n1.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT system mostly\n\
    comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical data\
    \ engines\nmine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict\
    \ future climate\nconditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop\
    \ and precise farming\npractices can then be predeﬁned to improve agriculture\
    \ production capacity and\nquality.\n2.\nAgri-IoT for Precision Farming: This\
    \ is the most famous application of Agri-IoT, whereby\nfarming practices (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer application, etc.) are precisely and accu-\nrately controlled\
    \ to optimize these resources. Here, the SNs are mostly ﬁtted with soil\nsensors\
    \ to collect a vast array of microclimatic data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and salinity) that can enable farmers to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertiliz-\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n275\ners, and pesticides needed by the crops to minimize resources’\
    \ costs and produce\nhealthier crops. Additionally, the BS controls the event\
    \ actuation system via accurate\ndata-driven real-time decisions on the crops\
    \ using climate data, crop growth data,\nand disease infection data.\n3.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides more accu-\n\
    rate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting, temperature,\n\
    soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management. This allows\n\
    precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming practices.\n\
    4.\nAgri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs are\
    \ attached\nto livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical\
    \ location, and log\ntheir performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate\
    \ sick animals to avoid\ncontamination and reduce stafﬁng expenses.\n5.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-\n\
    time data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting\n\
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,\n\
    for proper planning.\n6.\nAgricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such\
    \ as DroneSeed, are ﬁtted with\nmobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural\
    \ data or perform activities such\nas ﬁeld surveillance, crop planting, pest control,\
    \ farm spraying, crop monitoring, etc.\nFor example, for Agri-Drones, all the\
    \ above use cases utilize the WSN-based Agri-IoT\nframework.\n1/21/22, 11:01 AM\n\

    \ established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could\nnot meet\
    \ both performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the\n\
    fundamental concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies.\n\
    To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct\
    \ a systematic\nassessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT\
    \ and propose a suitable option for\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally,\
    \ the conventional IoT ecosystem consists\nof the network architectural layers\
    \ and the data management platforms [2,7,8], which\nare further grouped into devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to\ncloud), platforms/applications’\
    \ cloud, and agents/users. Due to the domain-speciﬁc\nrequirements of IoT applications\
    \ and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices\nIoT 2023, 4\n276\n\
    with application-speciﬁc requirements, there are generally no uniﬁed or standardized\n\
    IoT architectural layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently\
    \ adapted\nfrom the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer\
    \ [5], the cloud-based [7],\nthe service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and\
    \ the fog-based [2,7,29], as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n714.svg\n\

    \ in the state of the art of IoT ecosystem.\nThe fog-based architecture was adapted\
    \ from the three-layer parent architecture to in-\nclude cloud computing by offering\
    \ computing, storage, and network information between\nthe clients and the cloud\
    \ services [29] in a decentralized manner. Here, cloud computing\nand fog/edge\
    \ computing architectures only differ in where data computing occurs. These\n\
    layers are not uniﬁed because the respective network layers do not cover all underlying\n\
    technologies that transfer data to all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are\
    \ based on com-\nplicated centralized and ﬂooding-based routing architectures,\
    \ high-resource-demanding\nand capital-intensive Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication\
    \ technologies. As well, they\nrequire wired infrastructural support in the farm,\
    \ which is too complex, location-restricted,\nand capital-intensive for most low-income\
    \ and non-expert farmers to implement and\nmanage. Consequently, they are unsuitable\
    \ candidates for the resource-constrained SNs\nin WSN-based Agri-IoT. By implication,\
    \ there are no reference guidelines for designing\nAgri-IoT participants and supervisory\
    \ protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery,\nsmoothing out SN’s integration,\
    \ unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-\nIoT reference models,\
    \ among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 3, consists of:\n1.\nAgri-IoT network architectural layers: This shows\
    \ how the physical network elements,\nnetwork operation principles, and operational\
    \ techniques interact throughout the\nentire ecosystem.\n2.\nNetwork supervisory\
    \ software/routing protocol and routing architectures: This con-\ntains the virtual\
    \ arrangement of multiple network elements [8] and the event sam-\npling/routing\
    \ protocol that constructs the routing architecture, supervises sampling\nand\
    \ moderates all communications in the PHY layer.\n3.\nData management platform:\
    \ It hosts all high-resource-demanding data analytic en-\ngines, event databases,\
    \ and remote control algorithms in a cloud model.\n2.1. Proposed Architectural\
    \ Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nIn designing an efﬁcient Agri-IoT system of global\
    \ signiﬁcance, it is imperative to\npropose suitable architectural layers and\
    \ evaluate how the various components interact in\nthese layers. With the emerging\
    \ advances in low-power, freely available, and boundless\ncommunication standards\
    \ (e.g., BLE) and unfulﬁlled potentials of CA-IoT network [12,16],\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n277\na new framework of cluster-based architectural layers for the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT ecosys-\ntem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center portion\
    \ of Figure 5 presents the key\ncomponents/technologies required in each layer,\
    \ while the Things taxonomies of hardware\ncomponents from the related literature\
    \ [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.\nThe underlying layers\
    \ in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows:\n1.\nIntegrated\
    \ Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related\napplications\
    \ that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT\nsystem\
    \ to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals\n\
    healthy. This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-speciﬁc\n\
    functionality, high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in\
    \ the\ncloud. This layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer;\
    \ however,\nthese are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management\
    \ sublayer\nmaintains end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that\
    \ data are transferred\nto the correct user. It also ensures that the correct\
    \ user executes the actuation.\n2.\nInformation Management Layer: This handles\
    \ data processing, storage, and other special-\nized cloud services and functionality\
    \ that make precise, actionable decisions. In Agri-\nIoT, the sensory data are\
    \ preprocessed locally to optimize communication power\nbut can be further processed\
    \ using analytic engines in the cloud for better decision\nmaking and remote monitoring\
    \ and control. This layer can be embedded in the above\napplication layers and\
    \ hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT ecosystem.\n3.\nNetwork Management\
    \ Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates devices over\na network,\
    \ and it coordinates with the above application layers. It also contains the\n\
    BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud information network.\n\
    By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication standards\n\
    such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah (low-power\n\
    Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the traditional\
    \ cellular\nnetworks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa, among others.\
    \ Unlike clas-\nsic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity utilize\
    \ low-power commu-\nnication standards. Also, since every communication standard\
    \ for the resource-limited\nWSN sublayer comes with unique resource speciﬁcations\
    \ and design tradeoffs be-\ntween power consumption, routing architectural constraints,\
    \ and bandwidth [4,14,17],\nthe best connectivity option must be selected to achieve\
    \ the desired application goals.\nConsequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity\
    \ technologies can be classiﬁed using\nseveral distinct parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption rates, uplink/downlink data\nrates, packet size, SN-count per BS\
    \ (gateway), network routing topology, the SNs’\nsensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver\
    \ power, frequency bandwidth, channel\nwidth, etc. (refer to the right portion\
    \ of Figure 5).\n4.\nPhysical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the\
    \ ﬁeld and all devices such as\nSNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices\
    \ that interact with the environment.\nThis layer senses and collects the necessary\
    \ information from the connected devices in\nthe WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT\
    \ networks, the sampled microclimatic data\ncan be processed and stored on the\
    \ local BS, the cloud, or both. The activities in the\ncloud or application layers\
    \ are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n2.2. Associated Hardware Components\
    \ and Technologies Required in the Proposed Architectural Layers\nTo precisely\
    \ model and design an Agri-IoT network of desired expectations (refer to\nFigure\
    \ 2) using the proposed architectural layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge\
    \ of the\nprincipal components and technologies used in each of these layers and\
    \ how they interact\nand adapt for their intended functions is imperative. As\
    \ depicted in the middle of Figure 5,\nthe Agri-IoT ecosystem is composed of the\
    \ following core components/technologies:\n1.\nThings: The Things unit is the\
    \ physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset\nand the BS or actuator\
    \ controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It\ncomprises\
    \ the monitored/tracked asset (for example, ﬁeld, crop, or animal), the SNs,\n\
    or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators, IoT-enabled\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n278\ndevices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling,\
    \ and routing technology\nin the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are\
    \ resource-constrained, freely\navailable communication standards such as Zigbee,\
    \ BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE P802.11ah\n(low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for\
    \ both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.\nThe Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet\
    \ via gateways (BS).\n2.\nGateway (BS): The BS interfaces the WSN out in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the applications situated\nin the cloud servers. This unit aligns with the\
    \ network management and actuator\ncontrol layer shown in the middle of Figure\
    \ 5. The WSN sublayer may have more\nthan one BS(s), each with the capacity to\
    \ handle most resource-demanding com-\nputational tasks besides actuation execution,\
    \ network construction, scheduling of\nevent sampling, and network supervision\
    \ services. They may also allow bidirectional\ncommunication with the cloud/user\
    \ and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices,\nthe BS can be equipped with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT,\
    \ cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\nor wired ethernet communication technologies\
    \ to interact with the cloud, and low-\npower communication standards such as\
    \ LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS,\nBLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate\
    \ with the sensor ﬁeld. However, Agri-IoT\nnetworks require that both upper-layer\
    \ and lower-layer communication technolo-\ngies of the BS should be low-power,\
    \ freely available, easy to deploy and manage,\nand platform-independent. The\
    \ BS may preprocess or relay the raw data to the cloud\nfor remote data processing.\
    \ The BS(s) locations are strategically chosen to optimize\nnetwork communication\
    \ costs.\n3.\nIoT Cloud: The Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It\
    \ consists of an on-\npremises or remote server farm that hosts the applications\
    \ layer, event data analytic\nengines, security protocols, robust IoT applications,\
    \ user interface, and event database.\nThe high resource-demanding data-processing\
    \ tasks are mostly executed by well-\nequipped cloud-hosted applications to manage\
    \ and store huge amounts of data,\nprovide monitoring and data analytical services,\
    \ enable communication with devices,\nand manage information access. The merits\
    \ of edge computing can be exploited to\nensure that large amounts of data are\
    \ post-processed off-device to reduce the response\ntimes of the cloud.\n4.\n\
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-\n\
    monitor the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation\n\
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical\n\
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application\n\
    layer itself.\n2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers\n\
    Although there is no uniﬁed, certiﬁed, and ﬂexible Agri-IoT architecture layer,\
    \ any\nsuitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure\
    \ 8 must satisfy\ncertain quality requirements, including:\n1.\nSimultaneous data\
    \ acquisition, analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators.\n2.\nMinimization\
    \ of huge raw data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to\nmaximize\
    \ actionable information quality.\n3.\nProvision of reliable network architecture\
    \ that supports energy-efﬁcient routing, sta-\nble connectivity, self-adaptability,\
    \ fault tolerance, operational simplicity/ﬂexibility,\nplatform independence,\
    \ affordability, and location independence of Agri-IoT designs.\n4.\nSupport for\
    \ automated/remote device management and updates.\n5.\nEasy integration of each\
    \ layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions via\nspeciﬁed APIs.\n\
    6.\nUtilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ and simple\nto deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying communication\
    \ technologies\nin the PHY and network layers as well as based on open standards\
    \ to guarantee\ninteroperability.\nIoT 2023, 4\n279\n3. Design and Implementation\
    \ of Agri-IoT Networks\nDespite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT, its potential\ncontributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass\
    \ the least complex, capital-intensive,\npure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3b and 7. Due to the broader applicability\nand higher signiﬁcance\
    \ of the WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT\nnetworks, this\
    \ study focuses on the former technology whose design and implementation\ninvolve\
    \ four crucial phases, namely:\n1.\nCustom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ location-independent, and\nadaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less\
    \ and easily manageable WSN.\nThe SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective,\
    \ architecture-deﬁned, and context-\ndeﬁned components so that the system operates\
    \ stably and efﬁciently, becomes afford-\nable to farmers, and easily integrates\
    \ to any real-world scenario without any expensive,\nﬁxed/wired backbone connections.\
    \ The low-power capabilities of the SNs help to\neasily integrate them into any\
    \ precision farms and greenhouses to operate over the\nentire crop season without\
    \ many technical hindrances.\n2.\nPhysical deployment of the SNs in the ﬁeld,\
    \ selection of the WSN’s communication\ntechnology, and design of a suitable supervisory\
    \ protocol to coordinate the construc-\ntion of appropriate event routing architecture,\
    \ the duty-cycle schedule of event sam-\npling to the BS, fault management, data\
    \ management, and network maintenance.\nAdditionally, a range of techniques such\
    \ as network participant mobility, cross-layer\ndesign, MAC techniques, data aggregation,\
    \ self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle\nschedule, security measures, localization,\
    \ and communication speciﬁcations of the\nSNs can also be exploited in the associated\
    \ routing protocols.\n3.\nSelection of appropriate BS/gateway communication technology\
    \ and design of a\nsuitable higher protocol to update the cloud database and execute\
    \ the actuation\nactions based on users’ requests or decisions on processed event\
    \ data.\n4.\nDesign of data analytical engines and applications in the cloud and\
    \ users’ remote\nmonitoring and control interface app, which is beyond the scope\
    \ of this tutorial.\nThese call for a systematic application-speciﬁc assessment\
    \ of the hardware components\nselected for every use case.\n3.1. Sensor Nodes\
    \ Design Considerations\nAs illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for\
    \ the WSN-based Agri-IoT network\nconsists of four main units, which include the\
    \ following:\n1.\nSensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment\
    \ and records the\nphysical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and can\nbe contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil\
    \ moisture\nsensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature\
    \ and\nhumidity (refer to Figure 3c).\n2.\nController Unit: This unit hosts the\
    \ processor, storage, and connection pins for the\nother units and all auxiliary\
    \ peripherals. The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT\nSNs are Arduino-based\
    \ and Raspberry-Pi-based (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due\nto their ability\
    \ to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, other off-the-shelf,\napplication-speciﬁc\
    \ controllers such as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere\nGreenStar\
    \ Rate Controller, Viper Pro multi-function ﬁeld computer, Radion 8140,\nTrimble\
    \ Field-IQ, etc. are also available.\n3.\nCommunication Unit: This unit is the\
    \ principal determinant of the node’s power\nconsumption, operational stability,\
    \ and affordability, as well as the routing architecture\nin the associated supervisory\
    \ protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows the available\ncommunication technologies,\
    \ but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, freely available,\
    \ simple, and reliable communication standard. Conse-\nquently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee,\
    \ LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates based on\nIoT 2023, 4\n280\nthe\
    \ support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the selection\
    \ must be\njustiﬁed from the technology requirement metrics via a decision matrix.\n\
    4.\nPower Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate battery\
    \ size\nand probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during the\
    \ SNs’\ndesign according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.\

    \ SNs and Designing the Supervisory\nSampling/Routing Protocol\nAfter custom-building\
    \ or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity is to deploy\nthe SNs on the\
    \ ﬁeld and design a contextualized supervisory protocol to coordinate the\naforementioned\
    \ network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in the ﬁeld can be either random\n\
    or deterministic. Both options require different methods to optimize the resulting\
    \ network’s\nperformance. For instance, under the deterministic approach, the\
    \ optimal parameters such\nas node uniformity and density must be predeﬁned based\
    \ on the distance thresholds of the\nassociated communication technology (i.e.,\
    \ connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource\noptimization mechanisms, the\
    \ type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the\nphysical parameter\
    \ to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,\nthe best\
    \ ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data sizes\
    \ as\nwell as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using\
    \ a cluster-based\nrouting architecture [9,24,26].\nBeyond the physical installation\
    \ of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations,\nthe remaining activities,\
    \ such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM,\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n281\nnetwork maintenance, sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling,\
    \ network adapt-\nability to turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization\
    \ mechanisms, and network\nreconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the\
    \ associated routing protocol [12,16,17,26,36].\nThis places crucial merits on\
    \ the physical locations of the SNs in the ﬁeld, thorough synthe-\nsis of network\
    \ design factors, and assessment of available routing architectures/techniques,\n\
    since this protocol manages all post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized\
    \ into\nthe core objectives of the routing protocol and its architecture, which\
    \ include power op-\ntimization, self-healing of any faults without the obstruction\
    \ of its normal operation,\nand self-adaptability to all turbulent and scalable\
    \ conditions. From the analysis above,\nwe can derive the critical primary factors\
    \ to consider when designing a routing protocol\nfor Agri-IoT networks, which\
    \ are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following\ncategories: SNs speciﬁcations,\
    \ security issues, application-speciﬁc factors, communication\nstandard compatibility\
    \ and capacities, and other auxiliary factors. At the PHY layer level,\nwhich\
    \ is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors can translate into the\
    \ stipulated core\ndesign objectives, which can be addressed via phase-based multi-objective\
    \ optimization\n(MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].\n1/21/22, 10:18 AM\n\

    \ 2023, 4\n283\nCost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition\
    \ to being\ninfrastructure-less, ﬂexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components\
    \ so that the\nsystem is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions\
    \ are too expensive and\ncomplicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,\
    \ and maintenance costs of\nthe resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept\
    \ to a minimum so that it can be\neasily acquired.\nSecurity Issues in Agri-IoT:\
    \ Security is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that\nhandle sensitive\
    \ information, especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-\nIoT networks\
    \ lack the requisite resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based,\n\
    distributed, and infrastructure-less WSN systems to achieve adequate data conﬁdentiality,\n\
    authenticity, integrity, and other security requirements, the security of the\
    \ agricultural\ndata is rarely a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated\
    \ routing architecture, such as\nthe clustering architecture, has an embedded\
    \ capacity to resolve on-site security issues.\nIn addition, both on-site and\
    \ remote information access types (e.g., via a smartphone or\ndesktop computer)\
    \ must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure and security\nprecautions\
    \ to secure unwanted access to sensitive information.\nThe Application-Speciﬁc\
    \ Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-deﬁned\nfactors vary based\
    \ on the Agri-IoT application, the ﬁeld settings, network maintenance prac-\n\
    tices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,\
    \ among other\nfactors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant\
    \ operational efﬁciency\nfactors of the routing software design objectives. Since\
    \ the collected ﬁeld data itself cannot\nmake sense without using analytic data\
    \ engines and predictive algorithms in machine learn-\ning, the BS or the application\
    \ layer in the cloud should deﬁne appropriate data-processing\nframeworks to obtain\
    \ accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data.\nCommunication Standards\
    \ of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sub-\nlayer of Agri-IoT network\
    \ places hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio\ntransceivers,\
    \ code space, and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to\nenhance\
    \ power savings [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a\n\
    typical Agri-IoT is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability,\
    \ simplicity,\nadaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing\
    \ capacity, and event\ndata quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural\
    \ limitations constrain\nthe network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned\
    \ technical challenges on\nthe network’s operational efﬁciency, interconnected\
    \ SNs that form the WSN are expected\nto withstand extra operational disruptions\
    \ caused by unfavorable weather conditions in\nthe ﬁeld [2,4]. Consequently, the\
    \ de facto PHY-layer communication standards for this\nlow-power, low bandwidth,\
    \ and distance-limited communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs\nhave been the energy-efﬁcient\
    \ platforms such as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suit-\nable MAC technique\
    \ is imperative in the routing architecture to curb all channel access\nchallenges.\
    \ For instance, the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and\n\
    the MAC layer speciﬁcations for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduled operation modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized\
    \ or mesh-based\narchitectures. BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based\
    \ routing architecture.\nConsequently, Agri-IoT network designers must make the\
    \ most appropriate and critical de-\ncisions regarding the network’s communication\
    \ requirements when designing the routing\nprotocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design decisions\nregarding energy-efﬁcient\
    \ multihop routing, architectural requirements of routing proto-\ncol, bandwidth,\
    \ routing table capacities, total communication cost, and the desired MAC\ntechnique.\
    \ Additionally, the physical conditions within the agricultural environment such\n\
    as atmospheric dust concentration, physical obstruction to wireless signal transmissions,\n\
    and the terrain need to be considered.\nAuxiliary Factors and Available Software\
    \ Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors can be\nnon-exhaustive depending on the\
    \ designer’s ﬁnancial capacity, user interface, information\nrequisition model,\
    \ cloud activities, operational expectations, and the available software\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n284\ntools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design software\
    \ tools for Agri-IoT exper-\niments (thus, in both simulations and real-world\
    \ testbed deployments) that can be used\ninclude NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink\
    \ [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39],\nGloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39],\
    \ SENSE [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39],\nShawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41],\
    \ among others. The key features that are frequently\nconsidered when selecting\
    \ any of these software platforms include Python or MAT-\nLAB/Simulink compatibility\
    \ for software model and hardware prototype integration\nduring real-world operation,\
    \ compatibility with low-power communication standards\n(e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee,\
    \ and SIGFOX), operating system support, programming lan-\nguage implementation,\
    \ the density of simultaneously simulated or ﬁeld-deployed SNs,\nco-simulation\
    \ with other hardware, documentation, easy access to upgraded versions,\nand installation\
    \ challenges [39]. MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly\nused experimental\
    \ tools, since these software tools are well-equipped with the stipu-\nlated features.\n\
    4. Unique Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nUnlike the\
    \ traditional IoT, which generally relies on ﬁxed hardware to route network\n\
    trafﬁc, a WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actua-\n\
    tion, and wireless communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed\
    \ across\nthe farm to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node\
    \ may perform\nadditional tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation),\
    \ network construction,\ndata redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in\
    \ multihop networks), and network\nmaintenance practices based on the network\
    \ size, application speciﬁcity, and associated\nrouting techniques. Also, the\
    \ WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous conditions\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration, and motion, using a\nwide\
    \ variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN. Therefore, assuming\
    \ that the\naccuracy and precision of event data in upper layers are preserved,\
    \ the Agri-IoT’s lifespan\nand its operational efﬁciency are rooted in the WSN’s\
    \ robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual\nexegesis into the design and maintenance\
    \ of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to con-\nventional IoT and wireless\
    \ ad hoc communication networks, the operational efﬁciency of\nthe WSN sublayer,\
    \ as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-speciﬁc characteristics\nand\
    \ resource-constrained factors such as:\n•\nHigher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in either a deter-\nministic or random manner to provide\
    \ the desired redundancies, spatial variability of\nsoil, topography, distributed\
    \ monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event\nreporting, and fault\
    \ tolerance. However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission\noverlaps,\
    \ data redundancies from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing\n\
    interferences, and packet collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence\
    \ of\ncommon standards in the ISM band [42].\n•\nLimited Power Supply: The SNs\
    \ are frequently battery-powered, which does not only\nconstrain their data transmission\
    \ rate, computational capabilities, and communication\ndistance but also subjects\
    \ Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service and data outlier\nfaults due to rapid\
    \ power depletion beyond certain thresholds [26,43]. Consequently,\nnetwork power\
    \ management through data-management-related, architectural-related,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters has been one of the principal research focuses\nin WSN-based IoT\
    \ applications to improve network lifetime.\n•\nFault Management (FM) (i.e., fault\
    \ detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance): The\nresource-constrained WSN\
    \ is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to high\ndeployment densities\
    \ and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25]. Al-\nthough faults\
    \ are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence\nrates\
    \ and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or tolerated\n\
    without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated WSN’s\
    \ rout-\ning protocol is well-equipped with efﬁcient self-healing and fault-avoidance\
    \ (power-\nsaving) mechanisms [12].\nIoT 2023, 4\n285\n•\nSelf-Adaptability and\
    \ Scalability: Although WSNs are application-speciﬁc, the topologi-\ncal dynamism\
    \ is inevitable due to node failures, node mobility, and scalable conditions.\n\
    Therefore, the associated routing protocol and network architecture must adapt\
    \ to\nthese dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconﬁguration and reactive multihop\
    \ event\nrouting techniques [44,45].\n•\nNetwork Architecture: The underlying\
    \ routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs\na network architecture that\
    \ can be ﬂat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based,\nand tree architectures)\
    \ or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the\npossible measures\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient local data processing, network maintenance,\nscalability,\
    \ minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and re-\nduced\
    \ network management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network\ntopology\
    \ indirectly determines the resulting network’s ﬂexibility, scalability, reliability,\n\
    communication strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12].\n\
    •\nMostly Requires On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in\
    \ a typical\nWSN-based Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to\
    \ execute on-farm\nactuation.\nProposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing\
    \ Protocols for Agri-IoT and\nRealization Mechanisms\nFrom the systematic evaluation\
    \ of the unique characteristics and challenges of the\nWSN sublayer, a three-tier\
    \ cluster-based framework that constitutes the condensed ex-\npected core design\
    \ objectives and their corresponding remedial strategies of WSN-based\nrouting\
    \ protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure 10. Suppose the\
    \ corre-\nsponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated routing\
    \ protocol. In that\ncase, the desired power optimization, self-healing, and auto-adaptability\

    \ and strategies of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols.\nThe importance of this\
    \ three-tier framework can be expanded on as follows:\n•\nAn adaptive and scalable\
    \ WSN-based routing protocol, as proposed in Figure 10, normally\nconstructs a\
    \ routing architecture that supports multihop routing, self-reconfiguration,\n\
    self-healing, and local network administration at a minimal routing table size,\
    \ commu-\nnication cost, and and control message complexity requirement. Since\
    \ communication\nIoT 2023, 4\n286\nis the principal power consumer, the operation\
    \ of the routing protocol must invlove\nfewer control messages. Also, it must\
    \ adapt to network turbulence due to SN failures.\nThe cluster-based architecture\
    \ exhibits the highest potential compared to related ar-\nchitectures [9,16,17,26].\
    \ The cluster heads (CHs) efﬁciently coordinate these activities\nby registering\
    \ and tolerating all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults,\nincreasing\
    \ the network size and SN density.\n•\nDue to the high vulnerability of SNs to\
    \ faults and failures, it is imperative to deploy\nsuitable FM techniques that\
    \ can detect, tolerate, or avoid possible root faults such\nas SN-out-of-service\
    \ and data outliers [25]. The adaptive clustering approach can\neffectively resolve\
    \ SN-out-of-service faults, while the threshold-based decision theory\nat the\
    \ local nodes and global levels can be suitable candidates for event data outlier\n\
    detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since power mismanagement is the root\n\
    cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance techniques optimize\
    \ the\nnodes’ power consumption rates.\n•\nFigure 10 also outlines the suitable\
    \ measures for power optimization in the WSN\nsublayer of Agri-IoT. In clustering\
    \ approaches, power consumption in the constrained\nWSN can be managed via message\
    \ complexity control, connectivity-related metrics,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46].\nIn addition to local\
    \ data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error\nchecks) and local\
    \ network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics),\nsuitable MOO\
    \ and multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering\narchitecture,\
    \ total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as\n\
    a design optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations\
    \ of the\nWSN phase of Agri-IoT.\nTo achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there\
    \ is a need for an architecture-speciﬁc\nmulti-objective assessment of the WSN’s\
    \ design cycle; from this, the associated parameters\nand theoretical models can\
    \ be derived and then theoretically optimized and validated\nexperimentally. A\
    \ novel holistic MOO framework can help realize these expected goals in\nboth\
    \ simulation and real-world Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists\
    \ the\nneed to carry out a systematic survey and assessment on existing routing\
    \ architectures, FM\nschemes, and routing protocols, and how these evolved in\
    \ existing real-world realization\ntestbeds of Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature\
    \ synthesis can help assess these qualitative\nperformance indicators constituting\
    \ the root QoS metrics in Figure 10 as well as deduce\napplication-speciﬁc guidelines\
    \ for improving CA-IoT networks using a precision irrigation\nsystem as a case\
    \ study.\n5. State of the Art on Routing Protocols for WSN-Based Agri-IoT Applications\n\

    \ requirements. This section\npresents a systematic synthesis of WSN-applicable\
    \ routing protocols under network ar-\nchitecture, the route discovery process,\
    \ and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11.\nTo help Agri-IoT designers\
    \ make well-informed decisions concerning architectural selection,\nwe classiﬁed\
    \ the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery process,\n\
    and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual\
    \ reasons why\nthey can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event\
    \ routing in every protocol\ncan either be source-initiated or destination-initiated,\
    \ and the optimal path selection from\nthe constructed routing architecture can\
    \ also be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-\nbased, or parameter-determined\
    \ using location-related, weight-based, and content-based\nmetrics [13]. Also,\
    \ routing protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms\nthat\
    \ ensure balanced network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efﬁcient multihop\
    \ rout-\ning, and effective implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented\
    \ in Figure 10.\nThe related routing protocols can be classiﬁed as illustrated\

    This class of protocols presented in Figures 11 and 12 can be sub-grouped into\
    \ ﬂat-\nbased centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂooding/peer-\nto-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree\
    \ architectures,\nand the location-based protocols [37].\n1/21/22, 11:11 AM\n\

    \ Sample network architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/ﬂooding-\n\
    based architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer.\nIoT 2023, 4\n288\nThe centralized\
    \ protocols route data to the BS via single-hop routing, while the ﬂooding\nand\
    \ graph-based protocols ﬂood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing\n\
    protocols construct a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with\
    \ G(V, E)\nwhere a node and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively.\
    \ This method relies\non resource-intensive routing techniques from graph theory\
    \ used in classic IoT and ad\nhoc networks to transmit event data to the BS. In\
    \ contrast, the clustering/tree topology\ndepicted in Figure 12 groups the SNs\
    \ into either static or dynamic clusters, each with an\noptimally selected CH\
    \ to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s member\nnodes (MN).\
    \ The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings from its MNs,\n\
    executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating directly\
    \ (single-\nhop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing technique\
    \ to the sink\nnode or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs to balance\
    \ the network’s\npower depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding inﬂicts\
    \ extra energy burden\non the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped\
    \ to perform extra roles such as\nFM, coordination of the reclustering process,\
    \ network maintenance, relaying of aggregated\npackets in large-scale networks,\
    \ and management of network dynamism [12]. In general,\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocols differ in terms of CH selection methods and coincide in\nterms of\
    \ intra-cluster and inter-cluster multihop routing, local data processing by the\
    \ CHs,\nand CH role rotation [47], which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion,\
    \ prevent\nabrupt power exhaustion, and lead to exponential energy savings [37].\n\
    Although the ﬂat-based architectures, such as centralized and ﬂooding (see Figure\
    \ 12),\ncan be easily implemented in real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks,\
    \ they suffer severe\npacket collisions, communication bottlenecking at the BS,\
    \ and high inaptness for scalable\nor turbulent large-scale WSNs where energy\
    \ efﬁciency is a priority. Again, an optimized\nclustering approach can provide\
    \ an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations\nin Figure 10, and\
    \ it can also offer extra beneﬁts such as minimized communication cost,\nstabilized\
    \ network topology, efﬁcient load management, improved network maintenance,\n\
    and improved network trafﬁc and channel access management [37,48]. The main challenge\n\
    of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster quality (e.g.,\
    \ optimal cluster\ncount and cluster size) so that the computational, bandwidth,\
    \ memory, and routing table\ncapacities of the resource-constrained CHs are not\
    \ exceeded. Typical examples of clustering\nprotocols are the LEACH family of\
    \ protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP,\nand PEGASIS in [12].\nIn\
    \ location-based routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively\n\
    (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing\n\
    over Low-Power and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information.\
    \ This\nnormally results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the\
    \ SNs that form the\nWSN are spatially deployed in the ﬁeld without any IP-addressing\
    \ schemes, location\ninformation is needed in order to establish communication\
    \ between the nodes in a location-\nbased architecture. The location information\
    \ helps eliminate unwanted transmissions by\ncollecting data from a speciﬁc region\
    \ of interest. This architecture suffers from routing\ndelays, high infrastructural\
    \ cost, extreme difﬁculties in deployment and management,\nand high energy waste\
    \ due to SNs’ long idling durations. However, they are the most\ncommonly used\
    \ protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1,10,14,17].\n\
    Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures, it is not suitable\
    \ for Agri-IoT\napplications [12].\nIt is evident from the above discussions that\
    \ Agri-IoT-based network architectures\nmust be deﬁned by the associated routing\
    \ protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9\nas well as the application-deﬁned\
    \ requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance\nexpectations in Figure\
    \ 10. In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on\nthe quality,\
    \ precision, and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with\
    \ the\napplication-speciﬁc requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced\n\
    challenges, such as network turbulence and SN mobility.\nIoT 2023, 4\n289\n5.2.\
    \ Route Discovery-Based Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based\
    \ protocols focus on when the route for\ndata transmission is built and can be\
    \ grouped into proactive, reactive, and hybrid protocols.\nIn proactive routing\
    \ protocols, the routes are pre-created before they are needed.\nThese protocols\
    \ are table-driven, since every node stores a large routing table containing a\n\
    list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors to those destinations, and\
    \ the associated\ncosts of all next-hop options. Proactive protocols such as the\
    \ RPL and the APTEEN family of\nprotocols [15] make local routing decisions using\
    \ the routing table’s content. For instance,\nthe RPL operates as a distant-vector\
    \ protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the\nZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the\n6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such\nthat nodes\
    \ can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node in a\n\
    ﬂooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast message\
    \ to a\nspeciﬁc SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework\
    \ of RPL. The optimal\ncommunication costs and routes are estimated by ranking\
    \ the associated objective function\n(OF) metrics, which can be single-objective\
    \ optimization, SOO metrics, or MOO metrics.\nThis routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts\
    \ densely deployed and resource-limited SNs to\ncommunicate using peer-to-peer\
    \ or extended star network topologies [13]. Technically,\nRPL builds a directed\
    \ acyclic graph (DAG) with no outgoing edges from the root element\n(e.g., BS)\
    \ to eliminate loops. RPL is the primary underlying routing protocol in most failed\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed attempts. Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols\
    \ are\nrobust, reliable, scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control\
    \ messages with the\nhelp of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks\
    \ due to these technical challenges:\n•\nThe core of RPL/proactive protocols still\
    \ suffers from key challenges such as en-\nergy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability,\
    \ reliability, congestion, and security\nissues. Speciﬁcally, the energy expended\
    \ by RPL-inherited protocols to create routes\n(e.g., establish and maintain routing\
    \ tables) and transmit data can be too high for\nresource-constrained SNs in recent\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n•\nThe underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,\
    \ or IPv6) was designed\nfor energy-sufﬁcient devices with high processing and\
    \ memory capacities. Therefore,\nRPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained\
    \ Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table 5).\n•\nThey require costly ﬁxed IP infrastructural\
    \ supports and utilize the centralized routing\narchitecture, which becomes practically\
    \ impossible to manage as the network scales.\nConversely, the source-initiated\
    \ reactive or on-demand routing protocols only create\nthe routes on-demand by\
    \ a source to send data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc\nOn-demand\
    \ Distance Vector, AODV Protocol [13]) have no speciﬁc procedures for creating\n\
    and updating routing tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance,\n\
    the AODV is a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for\
    \ LLNs\n(e.g., WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures,\
    \ and packet\nlosses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ\
    \ and RREP messages)\nand route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although\
    \ reactive or AODV-based\nprotocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate\
    \ periodic updates, the associated\nﬂooding-based route–search process incurs\
    \ severe overheads resulting in high control\nmessage complexity, high route acquisition\
    \ latency, and high energy wastages due to longer\nSN idling periods. Consequently,\
    \ these protocols are unsuitable for power-constrained\nWSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n\
    The hybrid-based routing protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive\n\
    routing processes. However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require\
    \ expensive\nﬁxed infrastructural support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT,\
    \ even if the\ncombined merits of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited.\n\
    A comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based\n\
    routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is illustrated in Table 5.\nIoT 2023,\

    \ and\nmaintenance)\n5.3. Operation-Based Routing Protocols\nFinally, routing\
    \ protocols can be classiﬁed based on the operation or communication\nmodel employed,\
    \ which may include:\n•\nNegotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols exchange\
    \ negotiation messages or use\nmeta-data negotiations between neighboring SNs\
    \ before the actual data transfers to\nreduce redundant transmissions in the network.\
    \ A typical example is the SPIN family\nof protocols [13].\n•\nMultipath-Based\
    \ Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish\nhigher resilience\
    \ to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing.\n•\nQuery-Based\
    \ Routing Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a desti-\n\
    nation node broadcasts a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through\
    \ the\nnetwork. A node having the data being queried sends it in response to the\
    \ query.\n•\nCoherent and Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method\
    \ forwards data for\naggregation after a minimum local pre-processing. However,\
    \ in non-coherent routing,\nthe nodes locally process the raw data before routing\
    \ to the BS for further processing.\n•\nQoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’\
    \ purpose is to satisfy a speciﬁc QoS metric\nor multiple QoS metrics such as\
    \ low latency, energy efﬁciency, or low packet loss.\nThese protocols ensure a\
    \ balance between energy consumption and data quality in\nevery event-reporting\
    \ task.\nIn addition to route architectural construction and data transmission,\
    \ efﬁcient MAC\nmust be embedded in the routing protocol to manage the wireless\
    \ medium access and the\nduty-cycle/sampling schedules of the deployed SNs in\
    \ Agri-IoT networks. As opposed\nto classic IoT, the MAC techniques in Agri-IoT\
    \ are architecture-deﬁned by the associated\nrouting protocol to meet the energy\
    \ efﬁciency requirements of the network via channel\naccess management (CAM) and\
    \ the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the\ndeployed SNs to save\
    \ extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of\nMAC techniques\
    \ and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks.\n5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements\
    \ for Agri-IoT\nNext to node deployment, the routing protocol deﬁnes the network\
    \ architecture and\nselects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern\
    \ for the routing architec-\nture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT\
    \ applications include a low control\nIoT 2023, 4\n291\nmessage complexity and\
    \ low latency MAC technique that moderates sampling schedules,\naccess to a shared\
    \ medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g., packet transmission and\nreception,\
    \ retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead handling, and idle listening)\n\
    active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and transceiver channels. Thus,\
    \ an MAC\nprotocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications must be architecture-speciﬁc\
    \ and adaptive\nto network dynamics such as data transmission errors, interferences/packet\
    \ collisions,\nand regular interfacing of the active–sleep duty-cycled schedules\
    \ of the SNs’ transceiver\nstates (e.g., transmitting state, receiving state,\
    \ idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet\ntransmission and reception\
    \ in order to improve network throughput, energy efﬁciency,\nlatency, and other\
    \ QoS metrics.\nUnlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efﬁcient MAC technique\
    \ for Agri-IoT must\nensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment\
    \ management (CAM) and active–\nsleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and\
    \ channel perspectives. Based on these\ncommon dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC\
    \ (thus, duty-cycle optimization—DCO and\nchannel access management—CAM), existing\
    \ IoT-based MAC techniques can be classiﬁed\nas illustrated in Figure 13 and the\

    \ surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evalu-\nated the parent protocols\
    \ (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)\nfor classic\
    \ WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best candi-\ndates\
    \ for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV have\n\
    received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations\
    \ and prac-\ntice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique\
    \ endowments for realizing\nthe proposed expectations in Figures 2 and 10, it\
    \ lacks an in-depth design synthesis in the\ncurrent state of the art that can\
    \ uncover its contextualized performance optimization modal-\nities for real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT applications. In addition, the deployment requirements with\ntrending\
    \ technologies such as BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT\n\
    under both simulation and real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently,\n\
    the following sections present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art,\
    \ and how\nthe possible deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical\
    \ case-study such as a\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation.\n\
    6. State of the Art on FM Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT\nSince faults\
    \ and failures are inevitable in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer\n\
    to Figure 10), it is imperative to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses\n\
    of existing FM (i.e., fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA)\n\
    schemes, revisit their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations\n\
    for Agri-IoT network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s)\
    \ of\nfaults in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault\
    \ types, examining\nthe extent to which the existing FM schemes address these\
    \ root faults, and exploring\nhow these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks based on their\ncore assumptions, control message overheads/complexities,\
    \ and energy-saving capacities.\nFrom this thorough assessment, this section proposes\
    \ practical fault-avoidance-based FM\ntechniques for the next generation of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT.\n6.1. Systematic Overview of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults\
    \ in Agri-IoT\nAccording to the fault–error–failure cycle depicted in Figure 14,\
    \ a fault can be defined as\nany impairment that causes a system to produce erroneous\
    \ results or leads to the failure of the\nentire system or specific components\
    \ [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT\nis primarily due to the\
    \ SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,\nor resource\
    \ exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality (thus,\
    \ sensory\ndata error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan\
    \ of SNs) [25].\nDue to the high susceptibility of WSNs to faults, the supervisory\
    \ routing protocol is\nexpected to incorporate efﬁcient FM mechanisms that can\
    \ guarantee optimum event data\nquality and network availability. By implication,\
    \ FM algorithms for WSNs must not be\nstand-alone as currently seen in the state\
    \ of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral\naspect of the routing protocol\
    \ that agrees with the core participants of the PHY layer, such as\nthe SN, wireless\
    \ communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated on the left of Figure 15,\n\
    the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults in the Agri-IoT ecosystem,\
    \ in which\nthe SNs are the central origin of faults that can propagate to the\
    \ upper layers [25,43,73].\nThis is because the BS is resource-sufﬁcient mainly,\
    \ and the link’s reliability also hinges\nupon the SNs’ availability, as indicated\
    \ in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit\ndepicted at the bottom of\
    \ Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of\nprevalence\
    \ is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through\n\
    the disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions\n\
    presented in later sections.\nThe different taxonomies of faults in the state\
    \ of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73–77],\nas illustrated on the left side\
    \ of Figure 16, can be compared as follows:\nIoT 2023, 4\n295\n•\nHard or permanent\
    \ fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active and communicate\ndue\
    \ to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in soft or static faults,\n\
    nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes, but they sense, process,\n\
    or transmit erroneous data [44,74].\n•\nThe authors in [75,78] categorized faults\
    \ as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service\nfaults), transient (caused by temporary\
    \ conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic\nmanifestations due to unstable behavior\
    \ of hardware and software), and potential\n(due to depletion of hardware resources\
    \ [78]).\n•\nData inconsistency faults can also result from faulty sensing, processing,\
    \ and communi-\ncation, which is frequently caused by power depletion below a\
    \ certain threshold, while\npower failure occurs when a node exhausts its battery\
    \ power completely [43,77,79].\n•\nThe authors in [73] classiﬁed faults into software\
    \ and hardware faults based on soft-\nware and hardware impairments, respectively.\n\
    •\nAccording to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation\
    \ of hardware\ncomponents with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability\
    \ to cope with harsh\nenvironmental and operating conditions.\n1/20/22, 8:48 PM\n\

    \ in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT.\n\
    From the above deﬁnitions and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure\
    \ 16, it can\nbe deduced that hard, permanent, and static faults are practically\
    \ manifested as SN-out-of-\nservice, while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency\
    \ faults can be observed as data outliers.\nBoth SN-out-of-service and data outliers\
    \ are consequences of unit malfunction or resource\nexhaustion and can be permanent\
    \ or intermittent in behavior. Both conditions can impair\nthe quality of event\
    \ data and the global actionable decisions of the network. Therefore,\nthe quality\
    \ of FM schemes can be evaluated based on their capacities to effectively detect,\n\
    tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and data outlier faults. In summary, most\
    \ FM schemes\nin the state of the art focus on their effects, instead of the root\
    \ faults, which are the ﬂaws in\nexisting FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since\
    \ the SN is the sole network device responsible\nIoT 2023, 4\n297\nfor event sensing,\
    \ data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the WSN\nsublayer\
    \ of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks. A new\
    \ fault\nclassiﬁcation framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the above\
    \ analysis.\nSecondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the\
    \ most prevalent\norigin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend\
    \ or application level (refer\nto the right side of Figure 15). For instance,\
    \ communication, sensing, and computational\naccuracies of a node can be impaired\
    \ when the battery energy falls below certain thresh-\nolds [43]. Also, network\
    \ faults can be traced to power exhaustion and node failures, which\ncreate holes\
    \ in the topology that divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43].\n\
    On that account, faults can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving\
    \ strate-\ngies presented in Figures 9 and 10 are effectively implemented.\nAdditionally,\
    \ any FM scheme or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive,\npassive,\
    \ or active, must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that\n\
    represent the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery,\
    \ minimized\nmessage/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconﬁguration\
    \ to neutralize the\neffects of the faults [43].\nFM Framework and Architectures\
    \ in WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists\
    \ of three main steps, which\ninclude fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and\
    \ fault recovery/tolerance (FT) [82,83],\nwhich always require input information.\
    \ These steps are implemented in a decision-making\nframework that involves four\
    \ major processes: data/information collection, FD model\nformulation, FD decision\
    \ and fault classiﬁcation, and tolerance of its effects using any of\nthe FT mechanisms\
    \ shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD model detects the fault, the fault\ndiscovery\
    \ technique distinguishes that fault from false alarms, while the FT mechanism\n\
    helps to auto-heal and recover from the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service\n\
    faults are detected and tolerated using self-reconﬁguration techniques, whereas\
    \ data outlier\nfaults must strictly follow Figure 17.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n4.svg\n\

    Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.\nIn addition, FM schemes\
    \ can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed\narchitecture [44,85,86].\
    \ In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted and managed\non the BS,\
    \ whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm on the local\n\
    SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler for small-scaled\
    \ networks\nbut suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure\
    \ due to heavy message\ntrafﬁc at the BS and high SN energy waste. In contrast,\
    \ the distributed approach saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc on the BS\
    \ because it allows local decision and self-\nIoT 2023, 4\n298\nFD/FT with or\
    \ without neighboring. According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture\n\
    can be implemented in three major ways [43,89–91], which include self-detection,\
    \ neighbor\ncoordination, and the clustering approach. Since the basic design\
    \ requirement of a WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality\
    \ and longevity of the SNs and the\nBS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot\
    \ be self-ﬁxed must be tolerated to not\ninterfere with the core function of the\
    \ network. Therefore, any automated FT mechanism\nthat can be achieved through\
    \ the self-reconﬁguration and self-management for enhanced\nnetwork availability,\
    \ reliability, and dependability is encouraged in the WSN sublayer [92].\nAccording\
    \ to Figure 17, an efﬁcient WSN-based Agri-IoT, therefore, requires a calculated\n\
    mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.\n6.2. Systematic Survey\
    \ of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT\nFM in Agri-IoT networks has not\
    \ received adequate conceptualized research con-\nsiderations. As a result, existing\
    \ Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from\nthe traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This\nsubsection presents\
    \ a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths,\nweaknesses,\
    \ and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references\
    \ in [93–97]),\nthe underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the BS, while\
    \ the local SNs host\nand manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures\
    \ [87,88]. Although the centralized\napproach is simpler for small-scale networks,\
    \ it suffers many technical challenges, such\nas common point failure due to heavy\
    \ message trafﬁc at the BS, management difﬁculties,\nand high energy wastages\
    \ on distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor\nAgri-IoT testbed\
    \ experiments in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to\nthe\
    \ extent that the networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability\n\
    levels. However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98–103])\
    \ saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc and workload on the BS because it allows\
    \ local decisions\nas well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The\
    \ distributed FD/FT scheme\ncan also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or\
    \ clustering-aided [89–91]. Although the\nclustering-based FM architecture has\
    \ promising potential to improve energy conservation,\nnetwork adaptability, and\
    \ ease of implementation, it has not been extensively researched\nand exploited.\n\
    Again, distributed FD schemes are mainly established on the assumption that the\n\
    failure of SNs is spatially uncorrelated, while event information is spatially\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, the FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using\
    \ sensory data or statis-\ntical properties of the spatial or temporally correlated\
    \ SNs [79,104–106] from the immediate\nneighborhood of a node [74,103] or data\
    \ from farther SNs [107]. To date, the applicabil-\nity of these solutions to\
    \ the Agri-IoT context has attracted several technical challenges.\nConsequently,\
    \ the strengths and weaknesses of the main results of the benchmarking FM\nschemes,\
    \ their underlying assumptions, and how they addressed the critical fault-afﬁnity\n\
    factors such as energy conservation, FT/FA, control message complexity, and processor\n\

    \ and Their Shortcomings\nThe conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision\
    \ frameworks and the associ-\nated shortcomings can be expressed as follows:\n\
    •\nStatistical approaches such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statis-\n\
    tics [77,103], and normal distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical\
    \ test [105])\nare high-resource-demanding techniques that may apply to classic\
    \ IoT. Still, they are\nunsuitable for power-constrained Agri-IoT devices or SNs.\
    \ In addition to being stand-\nalone and without application speciﬁcity, these\
    \ methods operate at high computational\nand control message complexities. Their\
    \ operational efﬁciencies increase with increas-\ning data dimensionality and\
    \ also require a priori knowledge of data distribution,\nwhich is not possible\
    \ in many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally,\nthey rely\
    \ on predeﬁned thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore,\n\
    regardless of the extensive research considerations of these methods, they are\
    \ generally\nnot suitable for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is\
    \ no exception.\n•\nGraph-based FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier\
    \ detections [83,109], suffer\nhigher computational complexities, and also make\
    \ unrealistic assumptions about the\ndata distribution. In addition, these approaches\
    \ (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]\nand depth-based techniques) are unsuitable\
    \ for multidimensional and huge datasets.\n•\nMachine learning decision concepts\
    \ such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision\nrule concepts [93], naive Bayes,\
    \ iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based\ntechniques, among others,\
    \ are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer high\ncomputational cost,\
    \ and rely on sensitive model parameters.\nIn addition to the stipulated shortcomings,\
    \ these benchmarking FM methods usually\nignore the sensory data correlation (i.e.,\
    \ attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and tem-\nporal correlation) properties\
    \ of SNs, require high communication overhead with high FD\ndelays [83], and normally\
    \ operate in an ofﬂine manner, which is inconsistent with the\nmodus operandi\
    \ of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the recent low-power\nAgri-IoT\
    \ applications.\n6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions for Classic WSN-Based\
    \ IoT Networks and\nRecommended Design Guidelines for Achieving Efﬁcient FM in\
    \ WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nA fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks can be\
    \ manifested as a data outlier\nand SN-out-of-service or node failure, both of\
    \ which must be detected and resolved locally\nor globally using the spatially\
    \ correlated event information and efﬁcient threshold-based\ndecision frameworks.\
    \ Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes\nfor the WSN\
    \ sublayer, several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research\n\
    considerations exist. They include the following:\n1.\nMost faults in the PHY\
    \ layer of Agri-IoT originate from the SNs’ power exhaustion,\nwhich implies that\
    \ the best fault-avoidance techniques are those that optimize power\nconsumption.\
    \ However, most FM schemes waste more energy and make the net-\nwork prone to\
    \ more faults/failures via high control messages and computational\ncomplexities.\n\
    2.\nMost FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks without architectural consider-\n\
    ations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions, which make them difﬁcult to\n\
    incorporate into existing routing protocols.\n3.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture\
    \ is endowed with many untapped local/global FM\npotentials and fault-avoidance\
    \ capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT. However, these\npromising potentials\
    \ have received the least contextualized research considerations.\nExisting FM\
    \ solutions are meant for resource-sufﬁcient and expensive classic WSN-\nbased\
    \ IoT, not resource-constrained, context-speciﬁc use cases like Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following design\
    \ guidelines\nfor building efﬁcient and realistic FM schemes for WSN-based Agri-IoT:\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n302\n1.\nFM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions\
    \ in order to detect and\nauto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service\
    \ faults in real-time routing\nprotocols with minimal message, computational,\
    \ and memory complexities. Such FM\nschemes will be suitable for all power-constrained\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n2.\nFuture works on FM schemes must be embedded\
    \ into speciﬁc routing protocols so\nthat their adaptability to topological dynamism\
    \ and scalability in terms of network\nsizes and node densities can be assessed\
    \ in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault\ndetection and fault-tolerance schemes\
    \ based on simple threshold-based theories are\nthe best candidates for this context,\
    \ since the threshold boundaries of agronomical\nmetrics can be accurately computed\
    \ from the historical data of the location.\n3.\nFM schemes must incorporate redundancy\
    \ check mechanisms by exploiting spatial\nand temporal correlations among sensory\
    \ data.\n4.\nFM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global\
    \ FDs as well as\na reasonable detection rate and false alarm rate.\n7. State\
    \ of the Art on Real-World, Canon WSN-Based Agri-IoT Testbed Solutions\nIt is\
    \ well documented that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigat-\n\
    ing the negative impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for\
    \ which many\narchitectural designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed\
    \ [12,36]. In addition, since\nthe autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT\
    \ are expected to operate without\npost-deployment maintenance checks, the issues\
    \ of FM, power optimization, and self-\norganization during SN design and network\
    \ deployment cannot be ignored in existing\ntestbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially,\
    \ the results from most research projects on Agri-IoT\nrelied on simulation experiments\
    \ [1,10,14], which have retained the gap between the phi-\nlosophy of this technology\
    \ and the comprehension of its real-world behavior for a more ac-\ncurate performance\
    \ assessment. This section presents a systematic performance assessment\nof the\
    \ few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions currently based on the classic\n\
    WSN-based IoT principles. To understand how the benchmarking realization testbeds\
    \ of\nAgri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared in real-world operational conditions,\
    \ the results from\ntheir respective performances are systematically evaluated\
    \ and summarized in Table 8. It\nwas discovered that the current benchmarking\
    \ testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are\ncapital-intensive because they\
    \ are reliant on ﬁxed/location-restricted backbone infrastruc-\ntures (see the\
    \ middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert\nusers,\
    \ based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world\
    \ envi-\nronmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized\
    \ or ﬂooding\narchitectures which further complicate network manageability when\
    \ up-scaled. A concise\nand systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT networks and their ﬂaws\nin the state of the art is summarized in Table\
    \ 8.\nAdditionally, it can be established from the comparative assessment of the\
    \ benchmark-\ning Agri-IoT testbeds in Table 8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded\
    \ communication technology,\nevent routing architecture, and the SNs’ power management\
    \ are the core factors that made\nthem capital-intensive and complicated to both\
    \ experts and low-income farmers. Addi-\ntionally, self-healing, reconﬁgurability,\
    \ and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not\ndeployed [1,14,17]; hence, faulty\
    \ and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Further-\nmore, since the battery-powered\
    \ SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication\ntechnologies that are\
    \ not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery\nsupply\
    \ a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.\
    \ 4\ncommunication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols\
    \ restricted\nthe resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or\
    \ ﬂooding architectures\nwithout any efﬁcient FM techniques. As a result, these\
    \ solutions used costly ﬁxed IP\ninfrastructural supports and the centralized\
    \ routing architecture, making them practically\nimpossible to manage as the networks\
    \ scaled. This is why the SNs unstably exhausted their\nbattery power and abruptly\
    \ abridged network lifespans [1,10,11,14,18,19].\nIoT 2023, 4\n303\nTable 8. Comparative\

    Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, BLE,\
    \ 5G,\nZ-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable routing topology\
    \ are the best\ncandidates for making this ubiquitous application [1,16] cheap\
    \ [1,20] and simple for all\nusers. Thus, the cluster-based topology is more pivotal\
    \ to addressing the above challenges\nof Agri-IoT [10,17] than the traditional\
    \ cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible\nin many farms, depending\
    \ on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power\nconstraints, architectural\
    \ support, and network manageability challenges, these freely\naccessible wireless\
    \ communication technologies have speciﬁc limitations, which include:\n1.\nZigBee\
    \ technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star or\n\
    centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range (10–100\
    \ m)\nin line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.\n\
    2.\nLoRa is limited to low-density and ﬁxed network sizes (non-scalable), a low\
    \ data rate,\nand a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and\
    \ expensive antennae,\ndepending on its operation location.\n3.\nSigFox supports\
    \ a very low data rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox\npossess complex\
    \ implementations because they both require speciﬁc modules to\nfunction and gateways.\n\
    4.\nWiFi, GPRS, cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards\n\
    and location-/architecture-restricted.\n5.\nBLE has a short communication range\
    \ but supports clustering architecture, which is the\nmost optimal architecture\
    \ for ensuring the best operational efﬁciency of WSN-based\nAgri-IoT deployments,\
    \ since this architecture allows cluster isolation and management.\nTherefore,\
    \ a research opportunity exists for a ﬂexible, ubiquitous, realistic, energy-\n\
    efﬁcient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and wireless outdoor-based\
    \ testbed\nthat consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable, and wirelessly\
    \ conﬁgurable experimental\nSNs and a BS. It should also be deployed, re-deployed,\
    \ monitored, controlled, and managed\nby non-experts to operate stably throughout\
    \ the entire crop-growing season.\n8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\
    \ for Precision Irrigation\nAs earlier established in Figure 2, the design and\
    \ implementation of Agri-IoT networks\nare driven by unique critical factors,\
    \ which are mainly determined by the associated\nrouting architecture, communication\
    \ technology, actuation management mechanisms,\nand environmental impacts. In\
    \ the operation phase, these factors constitute the speciﬁc\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10, which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order\nto optimize\
    \ performance efﬁciency and stability. As systematically established above,\n\
    the LEACH-inherited cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential\
    \ to address\nIoT 2023, 4\n304\nthese technical challenges. It helps to attain\
    \ high power optimization via communication\ndistance and packet minimization,\
    \ efficient network administration/adaptability, high event\ndata quality through\
    \ auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated in Figure 10.\nSo,\
    \ this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits of this architecture\
    \ evolve\nin CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using the framework in\
    \ Figure 12, the cluster-\nbased architecture was pre-examined to uncover how\
    \ the fundamental Agri-IoT design\nrequirements and goals presented in the reference\
    \ frameworks in Figures 2, 9 and 10 can\nunfold into realistic multi-parametric\
    \ optimization metrics.\nThe conceptual architectural framework of the proposed\
    \ network, as illustrated in\nFigure 18, can be implemented using Arduino-based\
    \ or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based micro-\ncontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,\
    \ inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications,\nrespectively, and DHT22/STEMMA\
    \ soil moisture sensors for measuring the respective\nambient and soil microclimatic\
    \ parameters. Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing\nthe key network components\
    \ of MNs, CH, BS, and the ﬁeld-deployed precision irrigation\nsystem is shown\
    \ in Figure 19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH,\n\
    and BS, as illustrated in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after\
    \ Figure 2. Using\nFigures 18 and 19 as the reference architectural frameworks\
    \ for achieving our contextualized\nobjectives, this section presents an in-depth\
    \ systematic assessment and characterization\nof the scores of canon cluster-based\
    \ routing protocols of conventional WSN-based IoT\napplications so that the desired\
    \ MOO metrics can be appropriately deduced and adapted\nfor the design of the\

    \ 20a, the cluster features deﬁne the underlying connectivity\nissues, such as\
    \ cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster\n\
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].\n\
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality\
    \ of the\nCH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,\
    \ such as the\nspatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the speciﬁcation\
    \ of the wireless\ncommunication standard, the routing architecture, and the size\
    \ of the network [47]. Since\nthe deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can\
    \ be controlled, the stipulated cluster quality\nproperties can be optimized to\
    \ resolve connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly\ndeployed ﬁeld, these\
    \ cluster quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN\nduty-scheduling\
    \ mechanisms [9,12].\nSecondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated\
    \ in both homogeneous\nor heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource\
    \ hierarchy. Additionally,\nthe CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data\
    \ aggregation, FM, coordinating\nnetwork reconﬁguration or duty cycling, and network\
    \ maintenance, depending on their\nresource capacities and network requirements.\
    \ This case study is based on static SNs and\nthe distributed network construction\
    \ approach (see references in [9,12,33,126–132]), where\nthe SNs locally manage\
    \ the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire\nnetwork’s\
    \ information.\nAs shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized\
    \ by the clustering\nmethod/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the\
    \ CH selection method, recluster-\ning or network adaptability to topological\
    \ or scalable conditions, and the complexities (thus,\ncontrol message and computational\
    \ complexities) of the entire network operation cycle.\nUnlike the static approach\
    \ with ﬁxed CH, the adaptive clustering approach selects CH\nbased on the current\
    \ network conditions and rotates this role. However, both approaches\ncan incorporate\
    \ self-reclustering techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data\noutlier\
    \ faults can be best detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory\
    \ or\nspatial correlation methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale\
    \ and high\ndeployment densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering\
    \ process is more\nsuitable for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management,\
    \ and power optimization\nthan the centralized approaches [37,47].\nGenerally,\
    \ the CA-IoT network can be optimized by formulating the deduced optimal\ndecision\
    \ metrics in Figure 20a into a MOO framework and multihop routing model in\norder\
    \ to provide the guidelines for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From\
    \ the\ncomparative evaluations of Figures 10 and 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ for designing\nan efﬁcient WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b.\
    \ To enhance the clarity\nof the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and\
    \ justify the need for the proposed MOO\nmetrics, a comparative summary based\
    \ on the characterization parameters is presented in\nTable 9.\n8.2. CH Election\
    \ Techniques\nA CH selection process is very critical to the resulting network’s\
    \ performance efﬁciency.\nIn addition to centralized networks and the computationally\
    \ expensive fuzzy-based clus-\ntering approaches [133,134], the efﬁciencies of\
    \ all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly\ndependent on their CH selection techniques\
    \ [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of\nthe cluster quality metrics (i.e.,\
    \ CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics, the op-\ntimal\
    \ CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment. Currently,\n\
    these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach in LEACH-inherited\n\
    protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based method\
    \ [47,135].\nHowever, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited\
    \ protocols, is expected\nto perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal\
    \ clustering overhead, improved\nconnectivity, network/coverage stability, low\
    \ latency, collision-free routing, load balanc-\ning, high network stability span,\
    \ and algorithmic simplicity if the optimal CH count was\nIoT 2023, 4\n308\npredeﬁned\
    \ correctly [136]. However, the CH count is randomly predeﬁned in these proto-\n\
    cols [9,21], which undermines the CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s\
    \ optimality.\nThis challenge can be addressed via common CH selection metrics\
    \ including Euclidean\ndistance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster communication costs,\
    \ energy-harvesting capacities,\nand probabilistic factors. To date, the related\
    \ attempts in [49,126,137–139] only relied on\nthe SNs’ residual energy and location\
    \ information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH count\nis deﬁned, which cannot\
    \ be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT.\nFor instance, an active SN in a particular\
    \ round decides whether or not to become\na CH by choosing a random number (rn)\
    \ ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the\nnumber with a speciﬁed threshold\
    \ Th. A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if\nrn < Th, where Th is\
    \ expressed as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd×(( f irst−round)mod 1\npd\n,\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(1)\nwhere pd is the desired percentage of CHs or CH count per round,\
    \ and G is the number of\nSNs that have not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds.\n\
    The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH) that operates in\n\
    three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data transfer—to enhance\
    \ the\nenergy efﬁciency of LEACH. Their ﬁrst-level CH election approach modiﬁed\
    \ Equation (1)\ninto an enhanced threshold T(i), which is expressed as:\nT(i)\
    \ =\n(\n(r + 1) × mod( 1\np × p),\nif i ∈ G\n0,\notherwise\n(2)\nwhere p is the\
    \ CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that\nhave\
    \ not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds. The second-level CHs are selected\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function\
    \ as aggregated packet\nforwarders or relay CHs (RCHs).\nThe authors in [120]\
    \ introduced energy (E(i)) and distance (D(i)) attributes into Equa-\ntion (1)\
    \ to improve the load-balancing merit of LEACH. The resulting Th is expressed\
    \ as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd[r×mod 1\npd ] × [E(i) + (1 − D(i))],\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(3)\nMultihop routing via relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant\
    \ CHs in the\nfuture scope of [120].\nIn the LEACH presented with a distance-based\
    \ threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm\nin [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends\
    \ on the relative distance between a\nnode and the BS. This algorithm differs\
    \ from the LEACH algorithm because the desired\npercentage of CHs (pi) is predeﬁned\
    \ using Equation (5), while the threshold T(I, r) is\nexpressed as:\nT(i, r) =\n\
    (\npi\n1−pi×[r×mod 1\npi ],\nif Gi(r) = 0\n0,\nif Gi(r) = 1\n(4)\nNote that the\
    \ terms retain their usual deﬁnitions, namely:\np(i) = k\nξi\n∑N\nj=1 ξj\n, 0\
    \ ≤ pi ≤ 1,\n(5)\nwhere\nξi = 1/ECH × di − Enon−CH,\n(6)\nThe variable di depicts\
    \ the distance between node i and the BS, and ECH and Enon−CH\nare the average\
    \ residual energies in CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n309\nestablished the need for a multihop routing approach in simulations\
    \ and real-world WSNs\nto validate the countless theoretical propositions and\
    \ beneﬁts.\nIn the decentralized energy-efﬁcient hierarchical cluster-based routing\
    \ algorithm\n(DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First, the BS broadcasts\
    \ a trigger message at a\nspeciﬁc range. The receiving nodes then compete to become\
    \ a CH by disseminating a new\nmessage containing their residual energies and\
    \ distances from the BS. Using this informa-\ntion, a neighboring node i within\
    \ the target range receives the message and calculates its\nCHSn f uni as:\nCHSn\
    \ f uni = a × Erei\nEmax\n+ b ×\n1\nDis − To − BSi\n,\n(7)\nwhere Erei and Emax\
    \ are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively;\nDis − To\
    \ − BSi is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random\n\
    values between 0 and 1 such that a + b = 1. The values of Dis − To − BSi of node\
    \ i\nand its neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest Dis − To −\
    \ BSi value is\nselected as the CH. A ﬁrst-level CH broadcasts its residual energy,\
    \ neighboring node count,\nand distance from the BS via a speciﬁc route. The next-level\
    \ CHs receive the information\nand similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that\
    \ every node determines a redistributor\nCH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor\
    \ CH has more energy and fewer neighbors\n(neighboring degrees).\nHowever, the\
    \ Hamilton energy-efﬁcient routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an\nentire cluster\
    \ of nodes, aggregates data, and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian\n\
    path that has been created by the entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster\
    \ size by\nselecting one node as the CH using the probability function p, which\
    \ can be expressed as:\np = Lmessage\nFmax\n(8)\nwhere Lmessage is the size of\
    \ every node, and Fmax is the maximum size of a frame. The\nHEER protocol creates\
    \ the clusters only once in the ﬁrst round based on LEACH, and it\nrole-rotates\
    \ the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian path after a determined period.\n\
    Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125] randomly preselects the CH. A CH\n\
    also selects its closest CH as its redistributor CH. The clusters are static over\
    \ the entire\nnetwork lifetime, and the CH role rotates randomly within the clusters\
    \ according to a cluster\nreplacement threshold. The new CH inherits the redistributor\
    \ role if the old CH had one.\nOverall, since the node location, residual energy,\
    \ and sleep schedule are indispensable in the\nCH selection process, the CH selection\
    \ methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]\nare recommended WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO Frameworks and Recommended\
    \ Future Works\nAs Figures 9 and 10 illustrate, the performance efﬁciency of an\
    \ infrastructure-less\nWSN-based Agri-IoT mainly depends on the embedded MOO remedies\
    \ in the associated\nsupervisory routing protocol [12]. Several MOO frameworks\
    \ have been researched since\nAgri-IoT networks are subjected to multiple design\
    \ and operational constraints. A MOO\nframework is expected to formulate multiple\
    \ objective functions from a set of MOO metrics\nto simultaneously optimize these\
    \ multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings,\nhighest connectivity,\
    \ best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion\nrates across\
    \ the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for Agri-IoT,\n\
    the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT\nwithout any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they have not\
    \ fulﬁlled their\nintended purposes due to several technical challenges, including\
    \ the following:\n1.\nThey are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,\
    \ which implies that the promis-\ning potentials of the clustering architecture\
    \ are not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51].\n2.\nThey are frequently implemented\
    \ in the operational phase of the network, which\nmakes it challenging to ﬁnd\
    \ global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nIoT 2023, 4\n310\n\
    conﬂicting objective functions. The performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network\n\
    starts from the SN design.\n3.\nThey rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms,\
    \ such as mathematical programming-\nbased scalarization methods, multi-objective\
    \ genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/\nmetaheuristics-based optimization algorithms,\
    \ and other advanced optimization\ntechniques [23,26,48], making them unsuitable\
    \ for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT.\n4.\nThere are no contextual MOO guidelines\
    \ based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer\ndesign of Agri-IoT to achieve global\
    \ optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nconﬂicting objectives. Consequently,\
    \ there are conﬂicting scenarios in existing MOO\nsolutions [50].\nTherefore,\
    \ there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for\nCA-IoT\
    \ networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy\nmetrics\
    \ in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section assesses\n\
    how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and routing\
    \ protocol\nin a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.\n\
    9. Design of WSN-Speciﬁc CA-IoT Routing Protocol\nThis section proposes a CA-IoT-based\
    \ supervisory routing protocol that supports\nstatic SNs, rotatable/ﬁxed CH roles,\
    \ and enhanced SN resource management under the\ndeterministic deployment approach.\
    \ This can improve energy savings, connectivity, dis-\ntance moderation, and multihop\
    \ inter-cluster communication in the resulting network.\nThe operational cycle\
    \ and the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following:\n\
    1.\nNetwork Construction or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling,\
    \ CH election,\nand cluster formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduling ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their\
    \ scheduled sampling\ndurations. In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting\
    \ can be avoided\nusing a correlated pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling\
    \ approach in [12].\nThe optimal CH count and cluster size must be predeﬁned from\
    \ the resource capacities\nof the SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs\
    \ are recruited and assigned their\nrespective sampling and intra-cluster communication\
    \ timeslots.\n2.\nSampling, Data Management, and Transmission Phase: The tasks\
    \ executed in this phase\ninclude event sampling, intra-cluster and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmissions, data outlier\nFM, and event data redundancy management.\
    \ Since microclimatic soil parameters do\nnot change swiftly [1,14], sampling\
    \ can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly\ntime intervals. In addition\
    \ to power optimization, the clustering approach provides\nsuperb potential for\
    \ both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory and\nspatial correlation\
    \ techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and the resource\nlimitations\
    \ of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication beyond the BS or\ngateway\
    \ can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster and inter-cluster\n\
    communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology, since it\
    \ is\nthe most suitable for the clustering architecture.\n3.\nNetwork Maintenance\
    \ and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topolog-\nical dynamics\
    \ caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and un-\nexpected\
    \ operational ﬂaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality\n\
    via adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].\n\
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs\n\
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy\n\
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase\
    \ 2 after-\nward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected\
    \ and tolerated\nin this phase.\nIoT 2023, 4\n311\nCA-IoT  \nOperational\nCycle\n\

    \ FM/data redundancy scheme, network construc-\ntion/maintenance, and cluster\
    \ quality measures that can ensure unprecedented energy\nsavings and event data\
    \ quality. This clustering approach can further minimize energy\nwastage via a\
    \ suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless communication standard, data\naggregation\
    \ with data redundancy checks, and CH role rotation, among other factors.\nAlthough\
    \ the various sections of the deduced MOO metrics have been implemented in our\n\
    CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired performance can be optimally attained\
    \ when\nthe MOO metrics are modeled into their respective objective functions,\
    \ and their optimal\nvalues are determined and implemented in both simulation\
    \ and testbed experiments in\nfuture works. Also, a realistic multihop routing\
    \ framework can also be inculcated into this\nprotocol for large-scale applications.\n\
    10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Speciﬁc Agri-IoT Networks\n\
    This tutorial has ﬁrmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an indispens-\n\
    able component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite its resource-\
    \ and\ndeployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional IoT,\
    \ Agri-IoT is com-\npelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable\
    \ SNs. However, it must meet the\nexpectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable\
    \ performance. The cluster-based routing\ntechnique has emerged with promising\
    \ potential to mitigate these challenges. However,\nresults from existing testbed\
    \ solutions in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a\ncontextualized\
    \ in-depth overview of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which\nhave\
    \ not received extensive contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications:\n\
    1.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received\
    \ holistic\nand practical research considerations as far as FM, power optimization,\
    \ and network\nadaptability are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric\
    \ optimiza-\ntion frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the\
    \ WSN sublayer.\n2.\nConcerning FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of\
    \ the art are stand-\nalone, have high control message and computational complexities\
    \ (energy-inefﬁcient),\nand are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture\
    \ [25,52]. The desired\nFM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped\
    \ with fault-avoidance mech-\nIoT 2023, 4\n312\nanisms and the capacity to detect\
    \ and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and\nsensory data outliers [25]),\
    \ not their effects.\n3.\nMultihop routing, which is a requirement to attain the\
    \ desired energy savings and\nnetwork adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT networks,\
    \ is asserted to be more energy-\nefﬁcient only in simulation experiments [33,120,121,123–125,128–130]\
    \ but not in real-\nworld implementation [22–24]. This imbalance is due to a lack\
    \ of a comprehensive\nand reliable theoretical multihop routing framework that\
    \ is based on the total commu-\nnication costs of multihop routing.\n4.\nThere\
    \ is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can op-\ntimize\
    \ the operational efﬁciency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, den-\n\
    sity/uniformity of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration,\n\
    right from the network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    5.\nAlthough the current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role\
    \ rotation\nideology, there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator\
    \ in order to\nimprove the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus,\
    \ the cluster quality\nindices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be\
    \ predetermined before deﬁning\nthem in the associated CH election method, since\
    \ CH stability is compromised in most\nclustering methods [9,21,119–121,123,124].\n\
    6.\nMost protocols in the state of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks,\
    \ which is\nunrealistic due to variations in modular specifications and resource\
    \ utilization and the\nfact that different SNs may have different communication\
    \ and data computational roles.\nTherefore, a more realistic, contextualized,\
    \ and adaptive clustering approach that leverages\nthe gap between the philosophy\
    \ and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.\n7.\nIn addition to the parent\
    \ LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application\ncomprising routing,\
    \ MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication in\nWSNs, most\
    \ benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications\nare shelved,\
    \ since they are developed in solitude without application speciﬁcity and\nnetwork\
    \ architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol suite for\n\
    Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity.\n11. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis\
    \ tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, tech-\n\
    nologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the tech-\nnical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, adaptive,\nand affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey\
    \ of the benchmarking FM techniques,\ncommunication standards, routing protocols,\
    \ MMAC protocols, and WSN-based testbed\nsolutions; and (4) an in-depth case study\
    \ on how to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, adaptive, stable,\
    \ and cluster-based WSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\ntaxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ that can guarantee optimized network performance. Further-\nmore, this tutorial\
    \ established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO\nmetrics\
    \ for CA-IoT networks. Using the open technical issues, it recommended application-\n\
    speciﬁc requirements of Agri-IoT, general design expectations, and remedial measures,\n\
    and it evaluated them in CA-IoT for precision irrigation in order to optimally\
    \ exploit the\nproposed MOO metrics in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation\
    \ and real-world\ndeployment scenarios. Overall, this tutorial can serve as a\
    \ new reference document for the\nIoT community and Agri-IoT designers, since\
    \ it adequately examined all critical aspects of\nWSN-based Agri-IoT networks\
    \ from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation.\nAuthor Contributions:\

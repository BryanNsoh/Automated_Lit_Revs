    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table

    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Saudi Arabia's agriculture heavily depends on effective water management,
    given its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated
    by IoT integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste.
    The resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia's agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing

    Bamboo, a versatile and rapidly renewable resource, has played an essential role
    in human civilization for centuries (Bystriakova et al., 2004). The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) estimates that 2.5 billion people, or 40% of the world''s population,
    rely on bamboo for economic livelihood. Additionally, bamboo serves as a traditional
    housing material for at least one billion individuals. It is distributed across
    the globe in the form of grass with a remarkable range of 1707species from 128
    genera, each with unique characteristics and water requirements, which holds a
    key to sustainable development and resource conservation (Liese and Köhl, 2015,
    Sawarkar et al., 2023). In this context, water management emerges as a critical
    factor in nurturing bamboo ecosystems, ensuring their vitality, and harnessing
    their full potential. Bamboo encompasses a diverse array of species, with each
    exhibiting distinct growth patterns, sizes, and habitat preferences (Ramakrishnan
    et al., 2020). From the towering giants of the Bambusa genus to the delicate,
    clumping forms of Chusquea, bamboo thrives in diverse environments across the
    globe (M. Chen et al., 2021). These variations in species contribute to the plant''s
    adaptability and resilience, making it an invaluable natural resource for land
    restoration (Liese and Köhl, 2015, Sawarkar et al., 2023). Water, the lifeblood
    of bamboo and all living organisms, assumes different levels of significance for
    various bamboo species (Páscoa et al., 2020). Some species exhibit remarkable
    drought tolerance and can thrive with minimal water resources, while others demand
    a more abundant water supply to achieve their full potential (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Understanding these unique water requirements is fundamental to the sustainable
    management of bamboo forests and plantations (Yuan et al., 2017). Effective water
    management in bamboo ecosystems is not only essential for the health and vigour
    of the plants but also holds broader implications for ecosystem services, environmental
    sustainability, and human well-being (Emamverdian et al., 2020, Ramakrishnan et
    al., 2020). Water management practices that balance the needs of bamboo with those
    of the surrounding environment can help mitigate soil erosion, maintain water
    quality, and provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Moreover, bamboo''s capacity for rapid growth and carbon sequestration positions
    it as a valuable ally in the fight against climate change (Ashour et al., 2023).
    This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of bamboo, its various
    species, their specific water requirements, and the crucial role of water management
    in harnessing the potential of this remarkable resource (M. Chen et al., 2021).
    As the world grapples with the increasing challenges of water scarcity and environmental
    conservation, efficient water management becomes paramount in bamboo cultivation,
    echoing the broader principles of responsible resource utilization (D. Chen et
    al., 2014). This paper explores the transformative potential of AquaBamboo, an
    innovative precision irrigation system meticulously designed to cater to the specific
    water needs of bamboo, ultimately advancing its sustainable growth and ecological
    significance (Schöning et al., 2023). Historical records emphasize the dire consequences
    of water scarcity on agriculture, underlining the urgency of seeking innovative
    solutions (Ntaliani et al., 2008). Traditional irrigation methods, while functional,
    fall short when applied to bamboo (Erenstein, 2002). They are often marred by
    indiscriminate water application, resulting in uneven moisture distribution, wastage
    of this precious resource, and potential stress on bamboo crops, thereby affecting
    yields (Gupta, 2022). Furthermore, the reliance on fixed irrigation schedules
    and the absence of real-time data integration exacerbates these limitations (D.
    Chen et al., 2014). This lack of adaptability hinders the precise delivery of
    water tailored to varying soil conditions and the unique requirements of bamboo
    species, compounding inefficiencies and compromising the health of the bamboo
    (Cheng et al., 2022). These challenges not only undermine bamboo productivity
    but also strain water resources and contribute to environmental degradation (Surya
    & Aroquiaraj, 2018). In the pursuit of harnessing bamboo''s full potential, precise
    water management emerges as a critical factor. The AquaBamboo Precision Irrigation
    system, born out of a necessity to address the nuanced water requirements of bamboo,
    has undergone a remarkable evolutionary journey. Originating from insights gained
    through seminal studies such as (Abioye et al., 2020, França et al., 2023, Gendron
    et al., 2018, Kamienski et al., 2019, Sishodia et al., 2020, Tiwari et al., 2019).
    AquaBamboo''s technological prowess forms the backbone of its effectiveness in
    bamboo water management. The system incorporates a comprehensive hardware and
    software configuration. This integrated approach empowers AquaBamboo with the
    dynamic capability to respond to ever-changing environmental conditions. Notably,
    the incorporation of IoT sensors, weather stations, and advanced analytics positions
    AquaBamboo at the forefront of precision irrigation technology. These technological
    elements synergize to collect real-time data on crucial environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. What distinguishes
    AquaBamboo from traditional irrigation methods and existing facilities is its
    ability to transcend the complexities associated with bamboo plantations. In contrast
    to generic irrigation approaches, AquaBamboo is tailored to the specific needs
    of bamboo, acknowledging the variability in environmental factors within mountainous
    bamboo plantations. In response to these challenges, AquaBamboo emerges as a groundbreaking
    innovation in the realm of precision bamboo agriculture (Khorraminia et al., 2019,
    Sawarkar et al., 2021). With a primary mission to optimize bamboo water utilization,
    AquaBamboo integrates cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things
    (IoT) sensors and advanced analytics, to provide a holistic solution rooted in
    the principles of sustainable bamboo cultivation (D. Chen et al., 2014). Its dynamic
    adaptation to changing environmental factors, data-driven decision-making, and
    precise water delivery underscore its potential to revolutionize bamboo agriculture''s
    relationship with water resources (do Amaral et al., 2023, Jæger and Mishra, 2020).
    This research sets out to elucidate the distinctive features and advantages of
    AquaBamboo, comparing it with existing precision irrigation solutions (Pelé et
    al., 2022). By drawing insights from a comprehensive analysis of relevant literature,
    including studies by (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020; Parthiban & Seenivasan,
    2017), this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AquaBamboo''s
    significance in reshaping the landscape of precision bamboo agriculture, as highlighted
    in the works of (Khorraminia et al., 2019). In examining AquaBamboo''s integration
    of real-time data, adaptive irrigation strategies, and resource efficiency, this
    review paper aims to underscore the transformative potential of precision irrigation
    specifically tailored for bamboo cultivation (Chatterjee & Bhowmik, 2023). The
    subsequent sections will delve deeper into AquaBamboo''s architecture, its numerous
    advantages, and the profound implications it holds for the sustainable management
    of water resources in the context of bamboo agriculture (Jæger & Mishra, 2020).
    Through this exploration, we endeavor to shed light on how AquaBamboo can contribute
    to both increased bamboo productivity and the preservation of ecological balance,
    advancing the principles of responsible bamboo water management in the modern
    era (Isukuru et al., 2023, Khorraminia et al., 2019). 2. Literature review Precision

    positioned IoT sensors tailored for bamboo cultivation (Boursianis et al., 2021).
    These sensors meticulously capture essential bamboo-specific environmental data,
    including soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and real-time weather conditions
    (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020). This data serves as the foundational input
    for the AquaBamboo system, ensuring precision in water management for bamboo.
    Data integration and control system: The collected bamboo-specific data from IoT
    sensors are seamlessly integrated into the AquaBamboo control system, the intellectual
    hub of the operation. This control system diligently processes incoming data and
    makes informed decisions regarding irrigation scheduling. The control system encompasses
    key components that facilitate its operation: Data integration module: This module
    efficiently gathers and harmonizes data from diverse sensors, ensuring compatibility
    for subsequent analysis (Abioye et al., 2020). Advanced analytics algorithms:
    Integrated data undergo a bamboo-specific analysis employing advanced analytics
    and machine learning algorithms (Yousaf et al., 2023). These algorithms scrutinize
    historical and real-time data, uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations essential
    for data-driven decisions. Informed decision making: Drawing insights from analytics,
    the control system makes informed decisions regarding irrigation schedules. Factors
    such as bamboo species, growth stage, soil moisture levels, weather forecasts,
    and evapotranspiration rates are all considered during this meticulous decision-making
    process (Sawarkar et al., 2020). Precise water delivery infrastructure for bamboo:
    The control system''s informed decisions are then translated into precise instructions
    for water delivery, ensuring bamboo''s specific water requirements are met. The
    irrigation infrastructure comprises bamboo-specialized components such as • Valves:
    solenoid valves, strategically positioned, control the precise flow of water to
    different bamboo zones or individual emitters. The control system communicates
    with these valves to regulate water distribution with bamboo''s unique needs in
    mind (M. Chen et al., 2021); • Pipes: high-quality PVC or drip irrigation pipes
    facilitate the efficient transportation of water from the primary source to the
    bamboo. These pipes ensure reliable and optimal water distribution (Tiwari et
    al., 2019); and • Emitters: drip or micro-sprinkler emitters, strategically placed
    near bamboo plants, deliver water with precision. The control system issues specific
    instructions to these emitters, ensuring each bamboo plant receives the precise
    amount of water required for optimal growth (Devi, 2018). 3.4. User interface
    design AquaBamboo features an intuitive user interface designed to empower bamboo
    farmers (Yen et al., 2021). Through web or mobile applications, farmers gain access
    to real-time data visualizations, enabling them to monitor the system''s performance.
    Additionally, they can make necessary adjustments to the irrigation schedule based
    on real-time observations. This user-friendly interface puts the power of precision
    irrigation into the hands of bamboo cultivators, promoting active management and
    control. The system architecture diagram visually represents the flow of data
    and interactions among AquaBamboo''s components. It illustrates how the bamboo-specific
    IoT sensors feed crucial data into the control system, where advanced analytics
    and algorithms make informed decisions. These decisions then translate into precise
    water delivery through the specialized irrigation infrastructure, ultimately optimizing
    water management tailored explicitly for bamboo cultivation. AquaBamboo system
    architecture embodies a holistic and bamboo-specific approach to precision irrigation.
    It seamlessly combines real-time data collection, advanced analytics, and precise
    water delivery, revolutionizing water management practices for sustainable bamboo
    growth in alignment with the principles of responsible resource utilization. 3.5.
    Performance Evaluation 3.5.1. Precision water management principles for sustainable
    bamboo growth The incorporation of a comprehensive hardware and software configuration
    empowers AquaBamboo with the dynamic capability to respond to ever-changing environmental
    conditions and optimize water usage for the sustainable growth of bamboo (Sawarkar
    et al., 2023, Sawarkar et al., 2023, Yadav and Mathur, 2021) This integrated approach
    addresses the shortcomings of traditional irrigation methods, positioning AquaBamboo
    as a promising solution for advancing sustainable precision agriculture. Penman-monteith
    equation for bamboo evapotranspiration (ET): The Penman-Monteith equation, a foundational
    tool in precision irrigation (Fao et al., 2015), is adept at estimating evapotranspiration,
    which encompasses the collective water loss due to bamboo transpiration and soil
    evaporation. This equation accounts for crucial environmental factors, including
    temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Where:ET is the evapotranspiration
    rate (mm/day).∆ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa/°C).
    is the net radiation (MJ/m²/day).G is the soil heat flux density (MJ/m²/day).γ
    is the psychrometric constant (kPa/°C).T is the air temperature (°C). is the wind
    speed at 2 m above the surface (m/s). is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa).
    is the actual vapor pressure (kPa). Crop water requirement calculation for bamboo:
    The crop water requirement can be calculated based on the evapotranspiration rate
    and other factors specific to the bamboo''s growth stage and environmental conditions.
    Where: is the crop coefficient representing bamboo''s water use efficiency.A is
    the area of the bamboo cultivation field (m²). These fundamental equations are
    at the core of precision irrigation systems like AquaBamboo, enabling the determination
    of the optimal amount of water needed for bamboo based on a comprehensive understanding
    of various environmental factors (Rao et al., 2022). Parameters such as and A
    are fine-tuned to match the bamboo species and local conditions. Advanced bamboo-specific
    crop water requirement calculation: AquaBamboo takes precision to the next level
    by employing a sophisticated model for calculating bamboo-specific evapotranspiration
    ( . This model considers a range of influencing parameters: Where: represents
    bamboo-specific evapotranspiration (mm/day), accounting for water transpiration
    by bamboo and evaporation from soil and crop surfaces. is the bamboo-specific
    crop coefficient, indicating bamboo''s water usage concerning reference evapotranspiration
    ). is the reference evapotranspiration, representing water loss from a well-watered
    grass reference crop under standard conditions. are reduction factors due to mulching
    or ground cover, soil water stress, and salinity stress, respectively (Fao et
    al., 2015). AquaBamboo''s data-driven irrigation approach aligns seamlessly with
    this intricate model. By collecting real-time data from IoT sensors, which encompass
    critical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, AquaBamboo
    determines to reflect the specific state of the bamboo and its immediate environment
    (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Additionally, acts as a benchmark for gauging bamboo water
    requirements. AquaBamboo continuously calculates through the integration of weather
    data and sophisticated analytics, allowing it to adapt to dynamic weather patterns
    and ensure precise irrigation. Moreover, the reduction factors ( ) are influenced
    by various variables, all of which AquaBamboo incorporates into its decision-making
    process (Tiwari et al., 2019). Real-time soil moisture data helps assess soil
    water stress ( ), guiding precise irrigation interventions. The system''s adaptability
    to changing weather conditions and its ability to tailor irrigation schedules
    to bamboo needs contribute to mitigating salinity stress ( ). 3.5.2. Equation:
    Precision Irrigation in Action The equation I = k * D represents the core principle
    behind precision irrigation, where \"I\" denotes the irrigation amount required,
    \"D\" signifies the soil moisture deficit, and \"k\" represents the irrigation
    efficiency factor (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Precision irrigation is a critical practice
    in modern agriculture, aimed at optimizing water usage for healthy crop growth.
    • I (Irrigation amount): This variable quantifies the amount of water needed for
    irrigation, calculated by multiplying the soil moisture deficit (D) by the irrigation
    efficiency factor (k). • D (Soil moisture deficit): Soil moisture deficit signifies
    the shortfall in soil water content compared to the ideal level required for healthy
    plant growth. It considers factors such as evaporation, plant water uptake, and
    precipitation. • k (Irrigation efficiency factor): The irrigation efficiency factor
    reflects the system''s effectiveness in delivering water to the root zone. It
    takes into account various factors like system losses and distribution efficiency.
    In the context of AquaBamboo and precision bamboo agriculture (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022), this equation plays a pivotal role. By continuously monitoring soil moisture
    levels through IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo accurately calculates
    the soil moisture deficit and determines the precise amount of water needed to
    optimize soil moisture levels for bamboo growth. The efficiency constant (k) embodies
    AquaBamboo''s capacity to maximize water usage efficiency, ensuring that each
    unit of water applied contributes effectively to bamboo hydration and growth while
    minimizing wastage In essence, AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach seamlessly harmonizes
    with the complexity of the advanced bamboo-specific crop water requirement model.
    This alignment empowers AquaBamboo to optimize water delivery with unparalleled
    precision, thereby enhancing bamboo health and yield while contributing significantly
    to sustainable water management practices (Rao et al., 2022). The Fig. 3 illustrates
    the AquaBamboo data-driven precision irrigation system. It commences with IoT
    sensors collecting real-time bamboo-specific data, including soil moisture, temperature,
    and other critical parameters (A) (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020). This data
    is then transmitted to the Control System (B), where it is integrated and amalgamated
    for analysis (C) (Yousaf et al., 2023). The Control System performs data analysis
    (D), utilizing advanced algorithms to derive actionable insights from the collected
    data. Download : Download high-res image (75KB) Download : Download full-size

    analyzed insights, informed irrigation decisions are made (E) (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022). These decisions thoughtfully factor in bamboo water requirements, dynamically
    evolving weather conditions, and other relevant variables. Subsequently, the Control
    System translates these decisions into specific instructions to regulate the Irrigation
    Infrastructure (F) (Yen et al., 2021). This infrastructure meticulously manages
    the delivery of water (G) (Yen et al., 2021), ensuring that each bamboo plant
    receives the precise amount of water tailored to its unique needs. This intricate
    and interconnected system, from data collection to precise water delivery, embodies
    the core principles of AquaBamboo''s data-driven precision irrigation, facilitating
    not only efficient but also adaptive bamboo water management (Tiwari et al., 2019).

    Precision Irrigation The empirical implementation of AquaBamboo across diverse
    scenarios has unveiled its remarkable potential to revolutionize bamboo agriculture.
    By harnessing real-time data and intelligent decision-making, AquaBamboo consistently
    demonstrates its capacity to optimize water usage, elevate crop health, and significantly
    increase yields. AquaBamboo unequivocally demonstrated its ability to minimize
    water wastage while ensuring optimal bamboo hydration (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh,
    2020). Through the continuous monitoring of soil moisture levels facilitated by
    its network of IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo dynamically adjusted
    irrigation schedules and water distribution. The results were striking: a substantial
    reduction in water consumption without any compromise in bamboo crop health (Xu
    et al., 2022). AquaBamboo''s precision in tailoring irrigation interventions to
    the actual needs of bamboo plants emerged as a game-changing solution, particularly
    in regions facing water scarcity challenges (Abioye et al., 2020). Furthermore,
    AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach translated into remarkable improvements in
    bamboo crop health and yield (Sawarkar, Shrimankar, Kumar, et al., 2023). The
    system''s analytics provided critical insights into bamboo plant responses to
    varying water levels, empowering farmers to fine-tune irrigation strategies (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001). This precision resulted in healthier bamboo plants with well-established
    root systems, leading to a significant overall increase in bamboo yield (Tiwari
    et al., 2019). Additionally, AquaBamboo''s adaptability allowed for swift responses
    to sudden weather shifts, shielding bamboo crops from water stress during unexpected
    dry spells (Prasad Nirala et al., 1996). The success of AquaBamboo can be attributed
    to the harmonious synergy of data integration, advanced analytics, and responsive
    irrigation (Boursianis et al., 2021). Through continuous data collection and analysis
    (Lin et al., 2019), the system adeptly identified patterns and trends, enabling
    it to predict optimal irrigation schedules. This predictive capability ensured
    that bamboo crops received water precisely when needed, fostering accelerated

    based on (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020)), we visually depict the fundamental
    contrast between two distinct bamboo irrigation approaches: Traditional Irrigation
    and AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach. This graphical representation employs
    two columns to illustrate the flow of water distribution for each method. • Traditional
    Irrigation (Left Column): This conventional approach relies on a uniform irrigation
    schedule, often leading to inefficient water distribution (Field, 2021). Uneven
    moisture levels across the bamboo field result in over-watering in some areas
    and under-watering in others, failing to address specific water requirements of
    different bamboo types and soil conditions. • AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach
    (Right Column): AquaBamboo''s innovative methodology leverages real-time data
    collection to guide precise water delivery (Field, 2021). It considers factors
    such as soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and the unique needs of different
    bamboo varieties. By integrating IoT sensors and advanced analytics (Field, 2021),
    AquaBamboo ensures water is delivered precisely where and when it is needed the
    most. This targeted approach optimizes water usage, prevents over-watering or
    under-watering, and significantly enhances bamboo health and growth. Download

    vs. Tradition: Transforming Bamboo agriculture. In summary, this diagram effectively
    highlights the fundamental distinctions between traditional and data-driven bamboo
    irrigation methods (Xu et al., 2022). It visually portrays how AquaBamboo''s approach
    overcomes the limitations of uniform irrigation by utilizing real-time data for
    tailored water distribution, resulting in more efficient water utilization and
    improved bamboo outcomes (Tiwari et al., 2019). Fig. 5 (insights based on (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001)) visually portrays the correlation between soil moisture levels
    and both crop health scores (measured on a scale of 0–100) and crop yield (measured
    in kilograms). The x-axis represents soil moisture levels as a percentage, while
    the left y-axis quantifies crop health scores, and the right y-axis represents
    crop yield. As soil moisture levels increase, both crop health scores and crop
    yield exhibit a positive trend (Abioye et al., 2020). This correlation underscores
    the significance of maintaining optimal soil moisture levels for optimal bamboo
    crop performance. AquaBamboo''s precise water management, driven by real-time
    data, contributes to this positive correlation by ensuring that bamboo plants
    receive the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved health
    and higher yields (Boursianis et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the

    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res

    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Accurate and reliable predictions of biomass yield are important for
    decision-making in pasture management including fertilization, pest control, irrigation,
    grazing, and mowing. The possibilities for monitoring pasture growth and developing
    prediction models have greatly been expanded by advances in machine learning (ML)
    using optical sensing data. To facilitate the development of prediction models,
    an understanding of how ML techniques affect performance is needed. Therefore,
    this review examines the adoption of ML-based optical sensing for predicting the
    biomass yield of managed grasslands. We carried out a systematic search for English-language
    journal articles published between 2015-01-01 and 2022-10-26. Three coders screened
    593 unique records of which 91 were forwarded to the full-text assessment. Forty-three
    studies were eligible for inclusion. We determined the adoption of techniques
    for collecting input data, preprocessing, and training prediction models, and
    evaluating their performance. The results show (1) a broad array of vegetation
    indices and spectral bands obtained from various optical sensors, (2) an emphasis
    focus on feature selection to cope with high-dimensional sensor data, (3) a low
    reporting rate of unitless performance metrics other than R  2, (4) higher variability
    of R2 for models trained on sensor data of larger distance from the pasture sward,
    and (5) the need for greater comparability of study designs and results. We submit
    recommendations for future research and enhanced reporting that can help reduce
    barriers to the integration of evidence from studies.

    including fertilization, pest control, irrigation, grazing, and mowing. The possibilities
    for monitoring pasture growth and developing prediction models have greatly been
    expanded by advances in machine learning (ML) using optical sensing data. To facilitate
    the development of prediction models, an understanding of how ML techniques affect
    performance is needed. Therefore, this review examines the adoption of ML-based
    optical sensing for predicting the biomass yield of managed grasslands. We carried
    out a systematic search for English-language journal articles published between
    2015-01-01 and 2022-10-26. Three coders screened 593 unique records of which 91
    were forwarded to the full-text assessment. Forty-three studies were eligible
    for inclusion. We determined the adoption of techniques for collecting input data,
    preprocessing, and training prediction models, and evaluating their performance.
    The results show (1) a broad array of vegetation indices and spectral bands obtained
    from various optical sensors, (2) an emphasis focus on feature selection to cope
    with high-dimensional sensor data, (3) a low reporting rate of unitless performance
    metrics other than R2, (4) higher variability of R2 for models trained on sensor
    data of larger distance from the pasture sward, and (5) the need for greater comparability
    of study designs and results. We submit recommendations for future research and
    enhanced reporting that can help reduce barriers to the integration of evidence
    from studies. Similar content being viewed by others Comparing methods to estimate

    systems: a review Article 10 May 2023 Introduction Pastures account for about
    70% of the world’s agricultural land (Squires et al., 2018) and provide essential
    sources of high-quality forage for ruminants (Bouwman et al., 2005). Thus, pastures
    assume a key role in nourishing a growing global population with dairy and meat
    products (Henchion et al., 2017; Tripathi et al., 2018). Moreover, grasslands
    fulfill ecosystem services such as carbon storage and habitat conservation; hence,
    they help mitigate climate change and preserve biodiversity (O’Mara, 2012; Zhao
    et al., 2020). Pasture management is being challenged by increasing competition
    between forage and energy crops (Donnison & Fraser, 2016), land sealing due to
    infrastructure and housing, greater yield volatility due to climate change (Hopkins
    & Del Prado, 2007), and stronger constraints on fertilization (Buckley et al.,
    2016). Against this backdrop, accurate and reliable information about future pasture
    yields gains importance for agricultural management. These yield predictions can
    support the decision-making processes regarding fertilization, pest control, irrigation,
    stocking rates, and mowing. Overall, accurate yield predictions allow more efficient
    use of all inputs, resulting in less environmental impact and greater profits
    for farmers (Hedley, 2015; Kent Shannon et al., 2018). Machine learning-based
    optical sensing has become the prevailing approach to predictive modeling for
    pasture yields. In this approach, past observational data is analyzed to learn
    a mapping function between pasture characteristics and biomass at harvest. This
    function is used to predict the biomass for pasture characteristics obtained via
    sensors at a future time. Predictive modeling using machine learning (ML) takes
    advantage of significant improvements in technology for optical sensing (Adão
    et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2020), enhanced availability of field data at different
    levels of granularity (Murphy et al., 2021), and greater performance of the underlying
    ML algorithms. The importance of MLbased optical sensing for pasture yield prediction
    is reflected in the high number of studies in recent years. Evidence for the effectiveness
    of ML-based predictive modeling has increased. The evidence concerns different
    grass species, such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) (Nguyen et al., 2022),
    signalgrass (Brachiaria) (Bretas et al., 2021), and clover (Trifolium pratense)
    (Li et al., 2021), and different types of optical sensors, including portable
    spectroradiometers (Murphy et al., 2022), sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) (van der Merwe et al., 2020), and carried by satellites (Bretas et al.,
    2021). This variety converges with a broad set of ML techniques that developers
    can adopt. Developers must select techniques for the transformation of input data
    into features, the training of prediction models from past observations of input
    data and biomass, and the evaluation of the trained models on new observations.
    To inform these decisions on the development of prediction models, insights into
    the effectiveness of specific ML techniques are required. Notwithstanding the
    increased evidence base, the understanding of the effectiveness of specific ML
    techniques is still limited. Regarding the types of optical sensor data, a previous
    review found better performance for prediction models that were trained on in-field
    imagery compared to models that processed satellite data (Morais et al., 2021).
    However, about half of the included studies examined non-managed grasslands, such
    as steppe, semiarid grassland, bunchgrass, and shrub on drylands; hence, the finding
    cannot necessarily be generalized to prediction models for pasture yield. Two
    literature reviews focused on UAVs so that the results do not extend to models
    trained on data from field spectroradiometers and satellites (Bazzo et al., 2023;
    Lyu et al., 2022). Another review had a broader scope by including studies that
    collected non-optical sensor data (Murphy et al., 2021). One related review only
    provided aggregated information but no results at the study level (Subhashree
    et al., 2023). Collectively, the burgeoning field of pasture yield prediction
    using ML-based optical sensing calls for the assessment of current evidence to
    facilitate the development of prediction models. To address this need, we conducted
    a systematic review that is conceptually guided by the ML process. Specifically,
    the objectives are to: (1) determine the adoption of ML-based optical sensing
    in previous research examining yield prediction for pasture management, (2) collate
    the performance results, and (3) propose recommendations for future research and
    the reporting of studies. Method We conducted a systematic review of studies and
    report the results based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
    Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, where applicable (Moher et al., 2009).
    To ensure the reliability of the coding, three authors independently screened
    the identified records, assessed the full-text articles for eligibility, and extracted
    data from the selected studies. Eligibility criteria We included studies that
    applied machine learning on data obtained from optical sensing for predicting
    the yield of pastures, with yield defined as the current or future biomass of
    a specific pasture area, such as a plot, paddock, or field. The studies were required
    to report empirical results from the processing of real-world data. We focused
    on studies in refereed journals and written in English. The time interval of the
    past eight years (2015-01-01 through 2022-10-26) allowed us to assess studies
    that benefit from advances in ML and optical sensors in recent years, and thus
    have high relevance for research and practice. Studies were excluded if any of
    the following criteria were met: (1) dependent variable not related to a managed
    pasture but a different crop, nature conservation, biodiversity, or grassland
    coverage; (2) no prediction of yield but a different variable (e.g., nutrients,
    sward composition); (3) no predictive modeling but explanatory modeling or conceptual
    research; (4) no use of machine learning; (5) no processing of real-world data;
    and (6) no use of data from optical sensing (e.g., exclusively weather data).
    Information sources and search We identified articles through an automated search
    of journal articles published between January 1, 2015, and October 26, 2022. The
    search used the electronic database Scopus, which is the largest database of scientific
    literature and has larger coverage of peer-reviewed literature than the Web of
    Science (Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016; Singh et al., 2021; Thelwall & Sud, 2022).
    We designed the search query to cover the wide variety of terminology found in
    the literature. The search query had four concatenated components for pasture,
    yield, prediction, and machine learning. The pasture was represented as follows:
    (pasture* OR forage* OR grassland* OR *grass OR herbage* OR meadow*). Yield was
    covered by the following term: (yield OR biomass OR agb OR “herbage mass” OR “pasture
    mass” OR “grassland production” OR “forage production” OR quantity). The prediction
    component included different words as follows: (predict* OR assess* OR estimat*
    OR forecast*). Machine learning was represented by abstract terms and specific
    algorithms as follows: (“machine learning” OR “deep learning” OR “support vector”
    OR “random forest*” OR “neural network” OR “partial least square*” OR “predict*
    model*” OR “regression model”). Study selection We ensured the reliability of
    the study selection through the following procedure. We defined a codebook that
    provided the eligibility and exclusion criteria. The codebook was used in the
    screening phase by three authors who independently coded the first nine articles
    based on the title, abstract, and keywords. The coders met to compare their codes
    and resolve any conflicting codes through discussion. The coding commenced with
    the remaining articles. Once all articles were coded and discussed, we downloaded
    the full texts of the articles that passed the screening. The assessment of the
    full texts employed the same codebook and was organized in two rounds of coding
    and resolving disagreements. Data collection process The data collection for the
    included studies was carried out by the same three authors, who independently
    filled in an Excel spreadsheet form for 96 data items per article. The data items
    operationalize the conceptual framework described in the following section. All
    individual codes were compared in two rounds in which disagreements were resolved
    through discussion and consensus. Data items Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual
    model of the review based on the process of predictive modeling using machine
    learning. This process begins with the prediction problem and ends with the evaluated
    prediction model. The figure also denotes the principal data items that we collected
    during the review. Fig. 1 Process and principal data items for pasture yield prediction
    Full size image Forecasting the yield of pastures based on optical sensor data
    recorded during the vegetation period represents the prediction problem. Plant
    species are pasture plants that are cultivated and constitute the sward composition
    for which the prediction is made. Grazing indicates whether the pasture is grazed
    by animals or managed by machinery for forage conservation. Country denotes the
    location where the study was conducted. The process shown in Fig. 1 defines four
    phases, which we discuss in the following paragraphs. Data collection includes
    the creation of a data set by recording prediction-relevant data of the pasture
    vegetation and the observed yield at the time of harvest. Study conditions describe
    the number of fields, sample plots, and seasons for which these data were recorded.
    A sample plot is defined as the smallest partial area from which an independent
    sample of biomass is collected by cutting. Studies vary in the number of plots
    per field as well as in the size of plots, which usually range from 0.25 m2 to
    a handful of square meters. The input data can be classified into the following
    groups: vegetation indices calculated from spectral measurements (Xue & Su, 2017);
    spectral bands taken from imagery; textural features as properties of the surface
    calculated based on the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method (Haralick
    et al., 1973); sward height above the ground; weather data (e.g., precipitation,
    temperature) (Yao et al., 2022); site data (e.g., soil type, angle); and agronomic
    data (e.g., fertilizer input, irrigation, grazing rotation, stocking rates, species
    selection, and pest and weed control) (Smit et al., 2008). Another classification
    of input data is based on the dichotomy of biotic and abiotic factors affecting
    plant growth (Lange et al., 2014). Biotic factors refer to living organisms, such
    as grazing animals, insects, microorganisms, and other plants that influence pasture
    production (Kallenbach, 2015; Klaus et al., 2013). Abiotic factors encompass non-living
    elements, such as soil composition, temperature, water supply, and global radiation
    that determine plant growth (Baldocchi et al., 2004; Sorkau et al., 2018). A sound
    knowledge of biotic factors, abiotic factors, and their complex interactions helps
    to develop effective prediction models, although the conceptual differences between
    explanatory and predictive modeling need to be considered (Shmueli, 2010). Optical
    sensors for gathering input data can be categorized as follows. In-field sensors
    operate near the ground and foremost include field spectroradiometers for obtaining
    reflectance data, such as vegetation indices and chlorophyll content of plants,
    but also laser scanners, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), to create
    a 3D map of the pasture. Aerial sensors are mounted on an aircraft or unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect high-resolution imagery from a low flying height
    (Feng et al., 2021); they include hyperspectral, multispectral, and RGB cameras
    as well as thermal sensors and LiDAR sensors. Satellite remote sensing enables
    to record vegetation reflectance from the orbit. Data preprocessing is the second
    phase, which produces so-called features from the input data. Features represent
    characteristics of the empirical phenomenon on which a prediction model can be
    learned. Including all input data as features in the prediction model incurs the
    risk of learning from noise in the data and lacking in prediction performance.
    For this reason, feature selection provides different techniques for identifying
    smaller sets of features. The techniques are usually grouped into three categories
    (Chandrashekar & Sahin, 2014): (1) Filter-based techniques select features based
    on a metric calculated for each feature. For instance, correlation analysis can
    identify pairs of highly correlated features from which only one feature will
    be retained. Another technique is principal component analysis (PCA), which transforms
    a set of strongly correlated features into a smaller set. (2) Wrapper-based techniques
    remove one or more features from the initial set by iteratively training and evaluating
    alternative prediction models. For instance, backward elimination starts with
    the full set of features and removes features based on pvalues passing a specific
    threshold (in case of multiple linear regression). (3) Embedded techniques are
    specific to an ML algorithm. One example is Random Forests feature selection,
    which calculates the so-called feature importance metric and then removes features
    that do not pass a threshold for the metric. The third phase is model training
    in which example observations are used to learn a function that best maps a set
    of feature values to the corresponding observed yield; these examples are also
    referred to as input-output pairs. For estimating the mapping function, the field
    of supervised machine learning provides a large variety of ML algorithms. Frequently
    used algorithms for predicting pasture yields include Random Forests (RF) (Ho,
    1995), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Bishop, 2006), and Support Vector Regression
    (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1996) but also different types of linear regression, such
    as ordinary least squares (OLS) and partial least squares (PLS) regression. All
    these algorithms require a sufficiently large training set that includes a number
    of examples. Model evaluation is the final phase, which assesses the prediction
    performance of a trained model. Because of the many design alternatives to choose
    from in the preceding phases, developers usually evaluate alternative prediction
    models through experiments in which one or more factors are manipulated. By conducting
    factorial experiments, developers can devise a variety of experimental conditions,
    gain insights into how the factors affect performance, and eventually identify
    the best-performing model. Irrespective of the experimental design, evaluation
    calls for testing the prediction model on new observations, thus observations
    that were not included in the training phase. The evaluation can be accomplished
    using cross-validation, a test set, or both techniques. In cross-validation (CV),
    the data set is iteratively divided into subsets for training and testing. For
    instance, k-fold CV divides the data set into k subsets (folds) of equal size,
    trains a model for each combination of k-1 folds, evaluates the model on the left-out
    fold, and reports the mean performance for all k models. In other words, in each
    iteration, one fold is left out of the training set. Another type of CV is leave-one-out,
    which trains the model using all but one observation and tests the model on the
    left-out observation. The training and testing must be repeated n times, with
    n standing for the total number of observations. Different from CV, a test set
    indicates a technique that uses a separate data set of new observations. Either
    technique can apply performance metrics to quantify the accuracy of predicted
    vis-á-vis observed yields. Metrics for yield predictions include, for instance,
    the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the
    normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The report on prediction
    performance can be supplemented by information on so-called feature importance,
    i.e., a quantitative assessment of the extent to which individual features have
    contributed to the prediction performance. Various techniques are available for
    measuring importance, for example, by indicating how a specific performance metric
    would change in absolute or relative terms if the feature in question were removed.
    Other techniques specify importance as a percentage value, summing to 100% for
    all features. Such information is typically presented in column charts or placed
    in tabular appendices. Results Study selection Figure 2 shows the PRISMA flow
    chart of study selection. A total of 591 records were identified through database
    searching. We considered two additional studies that reported prediction models
    for pasture yield using optical sensing; the studies were listed in Scopus, but
    their records were not automatically retrieved. Of the 91 articles that were forwarded
    to the full-text assessment, 43 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria, and
    these studies were included in the review. Fig. 2 PRISMA flow chart Full size
    image Table 1 shows an overview of the included studies. The most frequently studied
    plants were perennial ryegrass (14 studies, Lolium perenne), clover species (8,
    Trifolium), signalgrass (5, Brachiaria), and timothy (4, Phleum pratense). Twenty-five
    of the pastures were mechanically harvested, and the remaining pastures were grazed
    by animals. Twenty-two studies were conducted in Europe, nine in Australia, six
    in South America, and four in North America, whereas only each one study was carried
    out in Africa and Asia. Predictions were always made right before harvest or very
    near to that day, except for three studies that used prediction horizons of 13
    days (Schwieder et al., 2020), 38 days (Li et al., 2021), and 152 days (Hamada
    et al., 2021), respectively. Table 1 Overview of the studies (N = 43) Full size
    table Data collection Table 2 provides the number of fields, sample plots, and
    seasons, followed by the different types of input data. Almost half of the studies
    were limited to data from a single field. The number of sample plots ranged from
    only two to more than one thousand (mean: 114; median: 54; n = 35). Two-thirds
    of the studies collected data in one growing season, and every fifth study covered
    two seasons. Two studies even covered eight (Jaberalansar et al., 2017) and twelve
    seasons (Ali et al., 2017), respectively. Twothirds of the studies were conducted
    at research facilities and one-third on fields operated by farmers (not tabulated).
    Vegetation indices were processed as input data in 29 studies. The number of VIs
    spanned from one index in four studies to more than 20 indices in eight studies.
    Sward height was used in 19 studies and it was either measured by UAV (13 studies),
    rising plate meter (3), LiDAR (1), meter ruler (1), or satellite (1). Nineteen
    studies processed spectral bands, which exhibited large variability between 2
    and 2150 different bands. In three studies, vegetation indices were complemented
    with textural features. All other types of input data played a minor role. Specifically,
    five studies used weather data, two studies considered site data (e.g., soil type,
    elevation, slope, and aspect), and only one study integrated fertilizer input
    as agronomic data (Franceschini et al., 2022). No study learned a model based
    on biotic data. Table 3 summarizes the adoption of the different types of optical
    sensors. Fourteen studies obtained data from in-field sensors, which included
    spectroradiometers (12 studies). Twenty-four studies collected input data from
    cameras mounted on aerial vehicles; the cameras recorded RGB images (11 studies),
    multispectral images (13), and hyperspectral images (5). Thirteen studies retrieved
    image data from satellites, including Sentinel (9 studies), MODIS (3), PlanetScope
    (2), Landsat (1), PlanetDove (1), and WorldView (1). Table 2 Data collection in
    the included studies (N = 43) Full size table Table 3 Optical sensors used in
    the included studies (N = 43) Full size table Data preprocessing Table 4 reports
    the adoption of feature selection techniques and provides the number of features
    per study. Feature selection was present in 24 studies, and the most frequent
    techniques were correlation analysis (8 studies), PCA (8), and stepwise regression
    (4). The number of features ranged between 1 and 101, although eight studies did
    not report this information. On one hand, four studies spared out feature selection
    but collected sensor data for a single feature. On the other hand, 18 studies
    trained models from at least 10 different features. Table 4 Feature selection
    techniques and number of features in the included studies (N = 43) Full size table
    Model training Table 5 provides information about the adoption of 16 different
    ML algorithms. The most frequent algorithms were Random Forests (20 studies),
    PLS regression (13), OLS regression using a single predictor (10) or multiple
    predictors (8), and Support Vector Regression (8). The size of the training set
    was stated in 41 studies, which either reported the number of examples, a percentage
    value of the examples used, or both types of information (not tabulated). In 10
    studies, the prediction models were trained on less than 100 examples. Table 5
    Machine-learning algorithms in the included studies (N = 43) Full size table Model
    evaluation Experimental manipulation Table 6 shows the frequency of each manipulated
    factor. The most frequent factors were feature set (19 studies) and ML algorithm
    (17). The former studies compared the performance of prediction models using different
    combinations of features, such as vegetation indices, spectral bands, sward height,
    and weather features. Nine studies investigated alternative sensors (e.g., UAV
    versus satellite). Six further factors were only examined in one study each. The
    number of manipulated factors per study was either one (16 studies), two (15),
    or three (2), whereas no manipulation was present in ten studies. Table 6 Manipulated
    factors in the included studies (N = 43) Full size table Model assessment Table
    7 shows the adoption of cross-validation and test set as techniques for model
    assessment. Twelve studies were limited to cross-validation, and another 13 studies
    only used a test set including new observations. The remaining 18 studies applied
    both techniques. Table 7 Model assessment in the included studies (N = 43) Full
    size table We note that the application and reporting of cross-validation exhibit
    large variation by leaving out one fold (19 studies), one example (7), or one
    site (1) in the training phase, whereas four studies provided no information in
    that respect. Regarding the test set, 29 of the 31 studies reported its size as
    a percentage of the whole data set. The number of examples ranged between 10 and
    433. Six studies had very small test sets with at most 24 examples, but ten studies
    had much larger test sets with more than one hundred examples. Performance metrics
    Table 8 reveals that R2 was reported in all but five studies. Thirty studies provided
    the root mean square error in kg per ha. Unitless normalizations of the RMSE were
    present in 25 studies. This normalization was either based on the mean (11 studies),
    range (4), standard deviation (2), and interquartile range (1) of the observed
    yield, or its specification was missing (7). Table 8 Performance metrics reported
    in the included studies (N = 43) Full size table Performance by types of optical
    sensors The high adoption rate of the unitless R2 metric allowed us to collate
    performance results as shown in Fig. 3, which groups 41 prediction models by the
    types of optical sensors used. The R2 ranged between 0.42 and 0.90 in the satellite
    group, between 0.50 and 0.94 in the aerial sensors group, and between 0.62 and
    0.92 in the in-field sensors group. The range was even smaller for the few prediction
    models that complemented in-field data by satellite data (0.71 to 0.90) and UAV
    data (0.81 to 0.92), respectively. Similarly, the mean performance in the in-field
    (0.79) and aerial groups (0.77) was higher than for the satellite (0.67) group.
    Two studies that processed data from aerial sensors and satellites at the same
    time reported R2 values of 0.70 (Pereira et al., 2022) and 0.72 (Barnetson et
    al., 2021), respectively (not shown in Fig. 3). Fig. 3 R2 of 41 prediction models
    by the types of optical sensors used (dots with filling indicate R2 on the test
    set, dots without filling stand for cross-validation) Full size image Feature
    importance Seventeen studies provided information on the importance of features.
    As shown in Table 9, many different techniques have been adopted, including variable
    importance in projection (Chong & Jun, 2005) and increase in RMSE (Kuhn, 2008).
    Six studies reported on the importance but lacked a specification of the technique
    used. In fifteen studies, only features based on spectral data were assessed (which
    is consistent with the focus on spectral variables in the data collection). In
    one study, the highest feature importance was assigned to canopy height (Schucknecht
    et al., 2022), and another study found that the relative importance of three weather
    features was one third, while three vegetation indices contributed two thirds
    (Bretas et al., 2021). Table 9 Techniques for feature importance reported in the
    included studies (N = 43) Full size table Discussion This review examined the
    adoption of machine-learning techniques for pasture yield prediction using optical
    sensor data. We analyzed forty-three studies that have been published in journals
    between 2015-01-01 and 2022-10-26. This section discusses the principal findings
    of the review and draws implications for future research and the reporting of
    studies. We also discuss the limitations of our review. Data collection For assessing
    the reliability of a trained prediction model, the number of fields, plots, and
    seasons are important factors that determine the size of the training set. These
    numbers can provide indications of how far the temporal and spatial variability
    of pasture yields have been considered in the data collection. Yet, more than
    half of the studies were conducted in one season, which restricts the training
    data to specific weather and growing conditions. One-third of the studies were
    limited to data from one field in one season. Even in the latter group of studies,
    the number of sample plots exhibited an enormous span from 21 to 1080. The chances
    that a model will perform similarly in future seasons can be enhanced by training
    the model on multi-seasonal data of different fields in which many plots capture
    the in-field variability. However, this approach puts a burden on researchers
    and farmers because the required effort for data collection increases significantly.
    The restriction of many studies to a single field limits the applicability of
    the trained models to a local level; hence, conclusions about their prediction
    performance beyond the specific field cannot be drawn. Three approaches are feasible
    to develop global models. First, data from a larger number of fields from different
    regions can be collected to develop models from data of greater heterogeneity.
    Second, data representing biotic and abiotic factors can be integrated to represent
    a larger set of growing conditions, thereby incorporating these factors into the
    development. A third possibility is to train a global prediction model by integrating
    multiple local models, i.e., the reuse of training data from different local sources
    (Liu et al., 2022). The included studies do not inform developers about the minimum
    size of the training set to achieve a reasonable level of prediction performance.
    One study manipulated the size but it found only marginal effects on performance
    (Rosa et al., 2021). The results of our review highlight that little is known
    about how to specify the size of the training set. This finding points to the
    need for further examination of the relationship between the training set and
    prediction performance. A common theme in the studies is the application of features
    derived from optical data, namely VIs (29 studies), spectral bands (19), textures
    (19), and sward height (15). Most studies collected data from at least two different
    types and considered multiple input variables, either alternatively or supplementary.
    The focus is on exploiting the potential of optical sensing and techniques for
    transforming image data into variables that are associated with plant growth.
    Therefore, it is not surprising that the number of VIs (1 to 97), spectral bands
    (2 to 2150), and textures (8 to 32) varied considerably across studies. It is
    noteworthy that the most frequent approach for measuring the sward height was
    UAV, which has substituted the manual measurement using hand-held devices. Consistent
    with the large array of VIs, spectral bands, textures, and sward height variables
    collected in combination, the types of optical sensors used indicate comprehensive
    coverage of current sensor technologies. All other types of input data, such as
    weather data (5 studies), site data (2), and agronomic data (1) played a minor
    role. This finding is surprising in view of the fact that such data can be obtained
    with relatively little effort or are already available. For instance, the retrieval
    of weather data is facilitated by online portal and programming interfaces (Jaffrés,
    2019). Historic and current weather data specifically for agricultural purposes
    are offered by companies, national meteorological agencies, and agricultural departments
    (Farmers Guide, 2022). Site and agronomic data are increasingly recorded by farmers
    and processed in digital farm management information systems. These data represent
    a so far hardly exploited potential for supplementing the spectral data and thus
    for training even more accurate prediction models. Data preprocessing Given the
    often-high dimensionality of the optical input data used, the objective of data
    processing is to reduce the number of features derived from the input data. This
    dimensionality is foremost due to the large number of VIs and spectral bands in
    many studies. The results of our review provide evidence for the relevance of
    feature selection, which was present in more than half of the studies (it was
    not relevant for four studies that collected data for a single feature). Overall,
    the techniques used span across filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded techniques,
    and reflect the variety of techniques available from the ML literature. In many
    studies, the number of features was effectively reduced without increasing the
    error of prediction. For instance, one study started with a set of 20 VIs and
    eventually selected one VI based on correlation analysis (Hamada et al., 2021).
    Another study considered 2150 different spectral bands obtained from a hand-held
    spectroradiometer and then performed stepwise regression using backward elimination
    to arrive at a linear model with only seven features (Zeng & Chen, 2018). Similarly,
    a study by Chiarito et al. (2021) applied a genetic algorithm to an initial set
    of 1024 spectral bands to choose a 13-feature model. Concerning the final set
    of features processed in the training phase, our review identified six studies
    in which the lack of feature selection led to models trained from at least 26
    features (Grüner et al., 2020; Karunaratne et al., 2020; Lussem et al., 2022;
    Näsi et al., 2018; Pranga et al., 2021; Schucknecht et al., 2022). For these studies,
    it might be possible that a model with fewer features exists that would perform
    similarly. Therefore, we recommend exploring the impact of feature selection on
    prediction performance when the model was trained on a large number of features
    derived from optical data. For studies that adopt a hypothetico-deductive approach
    to the model development, we suggest determining the relative importance of each
    feature and relating the results back to the model development. We also note that
    almost one-fifth of the studies provided no information on the number of features.
    Presenting complete information on the features included in the trained model
    would help assess the input data that necessarily must be collected and data that
    can be omitted. This information can effectively be reported in a table showing
    each feature along its unit of measurement and definition (Chen et al., 2021).
    In case the number of features exceeds the possibilities of a table, the information
    can be summarized by indicating the numbers per type of sensor as well as the
    initial and final numbers (Schulze-Brüninghoff et al., 2021). Model training The
    highest adoption rates were found for Random Forests, PLS regression, and OLS
    regression, whereas only four studies used Artificial Neural Networks. It is noteworthy
    that PLS regression was employed in 13 studies. PLS regression is a form of multiple
    linear regression in which the number of initially used independent variables
    can automatically be reduced by an in-built principal component analysis to a
    smaller set of features. Therefore, PLS regression appears specifically relevant
    for the training from spectral input data, while it still assumes linear relationships
    between the features and the pasture yield. However, two studies that compared
    the performance of PLS and MLR models reported conflicting results concerning
    the R2 metric (Askari et al., 2019; Borra-Serrano et al., 2019). Regarding the
    performance of linear vis-á-vis non-linear models, four studies found better performance
    for non-linear models, but three other studies came to the opposite conclusion.
    Overall, the results of our review suggest no evidence for the superiority of
    any group of learning algorithms. Forty studies stated the size of the training
    set, which varied greatly because of the different numbers of fields, sampling
    plots, and seasons between studies. This size must be seen in the context of the
    temporal and spatial variability of the specific pasture under study. If a prediction
    model is learned from too few observations that do not sufficiently represent
    this variability, the model will perform very differently for other test data.
    Our review identified two studies that had very small training sets of 32 (Näsi
    et al., 2018) and 36 observations (Li et al., 2021), respectively. Although no
    clear guidance is available for determining the minimum size required, it can
    give readers a hint about the reliability of the prediction model. Therefore,
    we suggest reporting complete and unequivocal information on the training and
    test sets used. The reporting should always include the absolute and relative
    numbers for each data set. For instance, this information can be visualized in
    a flow diagram that specifies the data processing (Murphy et al., 2022), or provided
    in a single sentence, such as the following: “the complete dataset was first divided
    into two parts in a 70:30 ratio (231 observations for the training dataset and
    99 observations for the test dataset)” (Da Silva et al., 2022, pp. 6039–6040).
    Moreover, any removal of observations throughout the preprocessing and learning
    phases should be justified, instead of generally referring to so-called outlier
    removal. Model evaluation Insights into the role of specific ML techniques for
    achieving high performance can be obtained from systematic testing of alternative
    models. The preferred method is the controlled experiment in which one or more
    factors are manipulated (33 of 43 studies). Our review identified feature sets,
    ML algorithms, and optical sensors as the most frequently used factors. The relevance
    of feature sets and sensors can be explained by the range of input data to capture
    the temporal and spatial variability of pasture yields. The evaluation should
    be conducted in a way that can mitigate the overfitting of a learned prediction
    model. A model is said to overfit if it fits well to the training set but exhibits
    much lower performance on new observations. For instance, it might be possible
    that a model that has been trained on a rich set of sensor data collected from
    several fields in different seasons will perform much worse for a different field
    or in a future season. To address the overfitting problem, cross-validation is
    appropriate for situations in which the total number of observations is insufficiently
    large to divide them into training and test sets. Different types of cross-validation
    are available, and they have been adopted in several ways. With respect to k-fold
    CV, the number of folds ranged between 3 and 20, with no study providing a rationale
    for the number chosen. This deficit also holds for the number of iterations of
    a CV; iterations were present in seven studies, and they spanned from only 5 to
    1000. Leave-one-out CV must be regarded as the weakest type of CV because it likely
    overstates the prediction performance for extremely small ratios of new observations,
    such as 1080:1 in one study (Sibanda et al., 2017). Almost three-fourths of the
    included studies assessed performance on a separate test set, instead of solely
    relying on cross-validation. Two studies stand out that trained models in one
    season (Togeiro de Alckmin et al., 2022) or two seasons (Murphy et al., 2022)
    to evaluate them in the subsequent season. Another study performed the evaluation
    on test data from a different field in the same season (de Oliveira et al., 2020).
    The size of the test set was most often stated explicitly in a table or text in
    the results section. For some articles, the size could be derived from a percentage
    value in relation to the entire data set. In seven other studies, the reporting
    in that respect was incomplete or inconsistent, but we could determine the number
    of observations through counting of dots shown in scatter plots. In a similar
    vein as for the training set, we recommend specifying the test procedure including
    the absolute and relative number of observations, any further data cleansing that
    led to the removal of observations, and the number of runs (if relevant). Regarding
    the reporting of performance metrics, our review provides three major findings
    that have implications for the interpretation of study results. The first finding
    is the relatively high adoption of the R2 (91%), followed by the RMSE (71%). Because
    R2 is a unitless metric, it can in principle help compare the performance of different
    models that predict the same type of pasture yield. Its interpretation is less
    dependent on the study context compared to the RMSE. The latter metric is more
    informative for farmers of the specific fields from which the observations had
    been collected and it can help assess how useful the prediction model is compared
    to current means of yield prediction. However, the RMSE cannot be used to compare
    models that have been trained on different observations. In other words, any claim
    about a proposed model that its RMSE would be smaller than that of a model proposed
    in previous research must be taken with great caution. In view of the duality
    of metrics that serve very different purposes, we contend that there is no reason
    not to report the R2 and RMSE. The second finding concerns the heterogeneity and
    ambiguity of the normalized RMSE. Given that the NRMSE was reported in more than
    half of the studies, this unitless metric might be used for comparing the results
    of similar studies. Unfortunately, we identified at least four different definitions,
    which render the comparison of results impossible. Only eleven studies reported
    the RMSE divided by the mean observed yield. This definition might be regarded
    as the ‘common’ meaning of the NRMSE, but seven studies provided no further details.
    This practice is questionable because readers might assume a definition that is
    different from the calculation done in the study. To make matters worse, the abstracts
    of 14 studies only indicated the NRMSE but not its exact definition. Moreover,
    different designations were used including NRMSE, nRMSE, relative RMSE (rRMSE),
    RRMSE, RMSE%, and RMSE with a percentage value. Taken together, our finding highlights
    the need for greater clarity in the reporting to avoid misinterpretations of the
    NRMSE. The third finding is the lack of consensus regarding the reporting of metrics
    to comprehensively describe prediction performance. The three most commonly used
    metrics (R2, RMSE, and NRMSE) were only reported in one-third of the studies.
    The frequencies of metrics such as MAE (10), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient
    (2), Willmott’s d (2), and mean average percentage error (1) were negligible,
    although other literature has highlighted the usefulness of these supplementary
    metrics (Chai & Draxler, 2014; Willmott & Matsuura, 2005). Irrespective of the
    advantages and disadvantages of specific metrics, we recommend reporting a larger
    set of metrics, including but not limited to the R2, RMSE, and NRMSE. Because
    of the large heterogeneity in the reporting of metrics discussed above, our analysis
    of prediction performance by the types of optical sensors used was limited to
    the R2 metric reported for 41 prediction models from 36 studies. We found that
    the variability of R2 decreased for smaller distance from the pasture sward; thus,
    the largest variability was observed for models trained from satellite data and
    it decreased considerably for aerial sensors and in-field sensors. These results
    suggest that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of in-field imagery can
    make a difference in the training of effective models. Although the individual
    contribution of specific features to prediction performance can be determined
    using feature importance, this was the case in only 17 studies. All but two of
    these studies focused on features derived from spectral data. Therefore, there
    is yet little evidence for the roles of biotic versus abiotic features, including
    weather, site, and agronomic features. The results of previous studies using optical
    sensing do not inform us about the influence of such features on the accuracy
    of models. Opportunities exist to examine the supplementing roles of non-spectral
    features, especially of those features for which data collection is relatively
    easy or the data is already available from the farmers. Collectively, the results
    of our review also highlight challenges for prediction models to become less local
    and increasingly global. Especially the large differences of pastures regarding
    soil properties, weather conditions, and plant species make the development of
    generalizable prediction model challenging. The collection of data reflecting
    biotic and abiotic factors is not possible by remote sensing alone. To develop
    more globally applicable models, it is necessary to include data from complementary
    sources (e.g., weather stations, soil analysis, and farm management information
    systems). Limitations The results of this review should be understood in light
    of its limitations. The included studies varied greatly in the processing of input
    data and how prediction models were trained. Therefore, it was not possible to
    conduct in-depth comparisons of performance results, except for the types of optical
    sensors used. Another limitation of the review is due to the large heterogeneity
    of the reporting of performance metrics. This heterogeneity limited the number
    of studies for which performance results could be synthesized; this synthesis
    was only possible for the R2 but not for the NRMSE. Third, although our data collection
    involved three independent coders, all results presented in this review were bound
    to the information reported in the original studies (in a few cases, we contacted
    the authors to clarify the meaning of specific statements though). Conclusion
    This systematic review provides a comprehensive account of the application of
    ML for the prediction of pasture yield using optical sensor data. The results
    highlight the richness of techniques used for the collection and preprocessing
    of input data as well as the training and evaluation of prediction models. Our
    review also revealed some shortcomings in the assessment of prediction performance
    and the presentation of study designs and results. Specifically, we identified
    deficits in the reporting of feature sets and complete information on the training
    and test data, and a lack of consensus in the reporting of performance metrics.
    We suggest specific recommendations to enhance the uniformity and comparability
    of study results, which can then facilitate the integration of evidence on the
    role of specific ML techniques for accurate and reliable yield predictions of
    managed pastures. References Adão, T., Hruška, J., Pádua, L., Bessa, J., Peres,

    systems incorporate new components that are capable of generating better decision
    making (humidity/temperature/soil sensors, drones for plague detection, smart

    model-driven development; analytics; smart agriculture 1. Introduction Smart technologies
    are transforming the agricultural sector by offering innovative solutions to increase
    productivity, efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. However, incorporating
    them into the agricultural industry also poses new challenges that need to be
    addressed. These challenges include the compatibility of new and old platforms,
    the protection of sensitive electronics from harsh environmental conditions, the
    regulation and ethics of data collection and sharing, and the inclusion and empowerment
    of small-scale producers. In parallel with these growing needs, emergent smart
    agriculture is applying cutting-edge technologies to improve the current agricultural
    practices regarding better use of the available resources and better information
    and support along the entire lifecycle, from the soil to the consumer. Techniques
    such as machine learning (ML), big data analytics, advances in sensors, communications,
    new machines like UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and advanced software development
    techniques pave the way to a new agricultural era, where these technologies have
    the opportunity to boost smart farming to a new level. Several use cases in the
    field span the use of UAVs for weed detection [1], robotic harvesting spotting
    pests using IoT [2], or a data forwarding algorithm for monitoring nutrient deficiency
    [3]. These use cases exploit the opportunities offered by applying one or more
    of the new technologies to the agricultural production pipeline. From a data analytics
    point of view, ref. [4] distinguishes several categories of data analytics: Memory-level
    analytics: analysing the data stored in some storage memory statically. Massive
    analytics: also referred to as big data analytics, it is the procedure of analysing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information. Business intelligent data
    analytics: it uses data to uncover insights that help a company or an organisation.
    The focus is on both present and future data. Offline analytics: it concerns analysing
    data for decision making but not necessarily on the arrival of the data, in order
    to derive insights and strategies. Real-time analytics: It involves reasoning
    and statistics on fresh actual data in order to provide faster and immediate rational
    and well-informed decisions, such as when reacting to sudden events. The flexible
    approach to where to store and where to compute that we showcase in this paper
    allows users to exploit different options in a flexible and low-code/no-code fashion.
    1.1. Background and Related Work There are several IoT-based smart systems use
    cases for agriculture production and to improve food production, such as Bu and
    Wang [5], which uses a four-layered structure consisting of (1) an agricultural
    data collection layer, (2) an edge computing layer, (3) an agricultural data transmission
    layer, and (4) a cloud computing layer. In this context, the information system
    consists of an agriculture data collection layer composed of several IoT devices
    retrieving different types of data (humidity, temperature, amount of light, etc.),
    enabling more complete information for better decision making. The next component
    in the pipeline is the edge computing layer, responsible for the data preprocessing
    from the devices, combining and optimising the different data structures retrieved,
    and avoiding unnecessary duplication. Once the data are optimised, they are delivered
    to the agriculture data transmission layer to be transmitted to the cloud computing
    layer and the real-time decision making process through deep reinforcement learning
    (DRL) models starts, by measuring and calculating the needs for the entire harvest.
    The system described in Rubanga et al. [6] delivers a low-cost solution for a
    tomato greenhouse using wireless sensor network (WSN) devices for micro-climate
    data and a PC for daily activity data (temperature sensor, humidity sensor, a
    barometer, a CO2 m, and a sound meter). The PC contains a Google Drive spreadsheet
    where different data are written manually, such as harvest, fertiliser use, and
    daily activities. Everything is then transmitted to a rental SaaS server using
    a MySQL database for storage, as well as the sensor data coming from the WSN devices,
    crop calendar, yield, etc. To analyse the data obtained, the growing degree day
    (GDD) method is used as a heuristic tool to measure heat accumulation to predict
    plant and animal development rates [7]. The use case presented by Saleheen etal.
    [8] consists of a NodeMCU ESP82266 microcontroller acting as the main actuator
    with a soil moisture sensor (YL-38), a waterproof temperature sensor (DS18B20),
    a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), a barometric pressure sensor (BMP180),
    a gas sensor (MQ135) for measuring air quality, an LDR light sensor to measure
    whether the plants are receiving enough light or not, an SIM800L GSM module to
    send messages to a phone to start or stop irrigation, an LCD 16 x 2 display to
    indicate output results of the sensors, and finally a two-channel 5 V relay module
    to turn on/off the water pump and the light source. In terms of software tools,
    it uses the Adafruit IO IoT-based cloud to interact with the hardware components
    via the internet and the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the NodeMCU board.
    The process works as follows: the board collects the data from all the sensors,
    and then the data are sent to the LCD and Adafruit IO platform. If the soil moisture
    is less than 15%, the GSM module will send an SMS to the user’s phone to start
    the water pump; if it is greater than 80%, it will send an SMS to the user to
    stop the pump. The decision still relies on the user, whether to start/stop the
    water pump and to turn on/off the light, but the entire pipeline simplifies the
    process. On the other hand, Mishra et al. [9] use only three layers to develop
    an intelligent agriculture system: a sensing layer, a fog computing layer, and
    a cloud computing layer. The first layer is composed of sensors and actuators
    deployed across the crop field to systematically sense the physical parameters,
    such as air temperature, air humidity, solar radiation, soil temperature, and
    moisture. The second layer comprises one or more servers to provide administrative
    control of the entire IoT infrastructure of the agricultural field, also addressing
    the limitations of intermittent connectivity, high latency, and high network bandwidth
    consumption of cloud-based infrastructure. The nodes collect data from the sensors
    deployed in the field and perform data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and fusion
    tasks. The third layer will consist of several end nodes that communicate the
    parameters from the field with the fog layer using LoRa communication or receiving
    actions/commands for actuation from those nodes. Said Mohamed et al. [10]’s exploration
    of Industry 4.0 and its application in smart agriculture holds significant potential
    for real agricultural farms, particularly in the domains of sensors, silage, tillage,
    and fertiliser management. By incorporating advanced technologies such as humidity,
    temperature, and soil sensors, as well as drones for pest detection and smart
    irrigation systems, the agricultural processes can be enhanced for improved decision
    making [10]. Their proof of concept in smart agriculture uses the Nordic Thingy:53
    as a multi-protocol IoT prototyping platform, demonstrating the practical application
    of these concepts. The integration of advanced sensing devices and edge computing
    capabilities contributes to efficient data collection and distribution for informed
    decision making in agricultural systems. This approach not only streamlines software
    development but also empowers farmers with tools to navigate the complexities
    of a multilayered heterogeneous IT ecosystem, ultimately improving the effectiveness
    and efficiency of agricultural processes related to silage, tillage, and fertiliser
    management. 1.2. Introducing a Composable Low-Code Architecture for Agriculture
    The previously discussed setups are complex and heterogeneous; i.e., they involve
    the integration of several technological layers working simultaneously to achieve
    efficient and cost-effective delivery of the different tasks and also require
    including various devices (actuators and nodes) with their different transfer
    protocols, dealing with orchestration challenges when trying to define the behaviour
    of the system. In this context, our approach simplifies the IT and integration
    tasks by composing models of behaviour to achieve the same results. By introducing
    the different domain-specific languages (DSLs) as a high-level abstraction for
    each behaviour and plugging them in, we enable a development cycle where stakeholders,
    instead of only defining requirements, can take action by participating actively
    in the successive stages of the project. In this context, our contributions cover
    the demonstration of various aspects of the use of two low-code/no-code (LC/NC)
    development environments, DIME [11] and Pyrus [12], and the extension of their
    application-domain-specific languages (A-DSLs) to this specific smart agriculture
    setting. Specifically, we aim to develop a simple, cost-effective smart agricultural
    system to have some analytics information from a greenhouse and enable a decision
    making process in terms of the different measures taken from it. To accomplish
    this, we will extend the range of A-DSLs that these two environments provide,
    in order to enable our external IoT systems to become amenable to this LC/NC application
    development approach, allowing a high level of reusability. This extension involves
    creating several building blocks to communicate with the different actuators,
    as well as to adopt and integrate the low-cost compact multi-sensor platform Nordic
    Thingy:53 [13] that we use to measure the different environmental metrics and
    enable the analytics pipeline for the subsequent decision making. While this is
    the component of choice for this demonstrator, the illustrated technology for
    the integration of IoT sensing hardware and rapid decision making is extensible
    to other devices. A number of industry partners in our projects are in fact developers
    of specialised sensors and actuators, and they are keen to lower the adoption
    threshold of their devices specifically regarding software integration and subsequent
    application development, which are issues for a large portion of their customer
    base. In the remainder of the paper, Section 2 briefly introduces our smart agriculture
    application, as well as all the components of the tools we use to design and implement
    it. Section 3 describes the experimental setup, the new methodology based on model-driven
    design and development, and the software architecture with the corresponding pipelines.
    Section 4 includes the results and discusses limitations, the flexibility aspects,
    and the enhanced reusability arising from our choice of specific MDD approach,
    and, finally, Section 5 contains our conclusions. 2. Materials and Methods In
    this section, we introduce the case study, the components of our smart agriculture
    application, and the tools we use to design and implement it. 2.1. The Agricultural
    Setup: IoT and the Edge The agricultural setup we consider consists of a greenhouse
    equipped with the Nordic Thingy:53 sensors, which helps us track light, temperature,
    pressure, humidity, and air quality. While we primarily consider a greenhouse,
    the same technology could be mounted on movable agricultural equipment, like a
    tractor, that may be driven by a human or autonomously, or a different controlled
    environment, like one or more silos where harvested products must be stocked under
    the proper controlled conditions for that product. Nordic uses the term IIoT as
    “Industrial IoT” because the sensors are mostly used in the context of industrial
    processes, like manufacturing floors and warehouses. Here, we welcome the robustness
    of their sensors for the greenhouse, outdoor, or controlled environments. While
    the systems from the literature explicitly introduce heterogeneous layers in the
    software and systems architecture, we focus instead on a plug-and-play approach
    based on the DIME and Pyrus flavours of LC/NC development, which are more easily
    extensible and more straightforward to design, implement, and maintain. The specific
    subsystems and technologies we consider and introduce are, in order, the IoT platform
    and device of choice (Section 2.2), the data storage and management in a NoSQL
    database (Section 2.3), and the choice to adopt LC/NC and MDD technology using
    two such design environments (Section 2.4). 2.2. IoT platforms: Thingy Series
    The Nordic Thingy:53 is an IoT device that allows users to create prototypes of
    IoT-enabled systems and applications comfortably, without the need to create custom
    hardware. As shown in Figure 1, Thingy:53 contains a dual Arm Cortex-M33 processor
    on a System-on-Chip(SoC) nRF5340. The processing power and memory size enable
    it to run embedded ML models directly on the device. It also contains a multi-protocol
    radio with support for Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, and Zigbee. The sensor
    platform consists of many different sensors, like colour and light sensors, accelerometers,
    and a magnetometer, all accessible without any additional hardware. The device
    also has autonomous life by using a USB-C rechargeable 1350 mAh Li-Po battery.
    Figure 1. The Thingy:53 sensors and I/O overview. The Thingy:53 is also accompanied
    by a sister app, Edge Impulse (nRF Edge Impulse: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.nrfei
    (accessed on 3 October 2023)), and a website (Edge Impulse: https://edgeimpulse.com/
    (accessed on 3 October 2023)), enabling users to transfer sensor data over Bluetooth
    LE to a mobile device and upload them to the cloud for training. This is a very
    appreciated capability as it offers the chance to select an already trained subset
    of ML models to enable a predictive pipeline and then deploy the models back on
    the Thingy IoT device for predictions. This capability enables an edge computing
    effect because optimised algorithms can, for example, filter, de-noise, and preprocess
    those data directly on Thingy at the edge. It is also possible to carry out full
    edge computing if some trained and optimised models can fit on the Thingy platform
    and, for example, categorise or classify the sensor data at the point of origin
    so that the data are processed in situ and never transferred elsewhere. The different
    sensors can be selected for data collection from the smartphone app. The data
    are originally recorded in CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) format.
    CBOR can be easily converted to more usable and popular JSON and CSV data formats.
    A snapshot of the data sent to the smartphone app from the Thingy:53 device in
    CBOR format and after conversion to JSON looks like Figure 2. Figure 2. The Thingy:53
    sample data description. The data contain the signature of the device used (unique
    ID), the name of the device (unique name), the device type (Thingy device), the
    time interval (in milliseconds) used for data collection, the list of sensors
    used with units in which values are recorded, and the list of values for each
    sensor. The values are recorded after a specified time interval, so the time series
    for the data can be reconstructed by noting the start time of the observations
    on the smartphone app and appending the time interval for the number of observations.
    In comparison with other IoT platforms, such as the Nordic Thingy:52 series, Thingy:53
    has twice the processing power and also valuable features like ARM trustzone,
    secure key storage, Bluetooth LE audio, and direction finding. In our use case,
    we will use the Thingy:53 series, which will allow us to run our ML models efficiently,
    taking less time for training, testing, and predicting. 2.3. Data Storage: No-SQL
    DB in the Cloud IoT architectures are inherently intensive in terms of data management
    as sensors continuously provide a flow of incoming data from multiple sources,
    creating a large queue of requests to the main application. These data are heterogeneous:
    they have different types, from basic formats such as images, videos, and text
    to highly structured types such as JSON formats or entire data structures and
    complex records. While relational databases can easily handle a huge volume of
    structured data, they lack enough flexibility to deal with different types of
    formats in a straightforward way, leading to more complex management, and scaling
    up, causing very high costs when either is needed [14]. Heterogeneous IoT data
    need to be stored and managed in such a way that it is possible, and even easy,
    to extract useful information. Requirements for data management in IoT applications
    that we need to consider include data heterogeneity, scalability, real-time processing,
    and security. On the other hand, as established by [15], MongoDB is an open-source
    distributed database created in 2007 by DoubleClick (now owned by Google). MongoDB
    created its own BSON format (binary JSON) and stores the data using a key–value
    pair strategy, with efficient support for query and retrieval of heterogeneous
    and even unstructured data in a fashion similar to the object-oriented paradigm.
    Data can be replicated using the master–slave model, and it also has its own query
    language that implements all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. As
    a consequence, we opted to use it in our proof of concept to leverage its main
    features, and it is the option we feature in the adopted system architecture.
    2.4. Model-Driven Technologies We embrace a LC/NC software development paradigm
    [16], that is rapidly gaining foot in industry and is predicted to become the
    development style of choice for 80% of newly developed software by 2026 [17].
    However, we specifically adopt a Model Driven Design and development paradigm
    [18,19] where the models are not just graphically suggestive but also have an
    underlying formal model in terms of Kripke Transition Systems [20]. This choice
    makes them analyzable through meanwhile well-established techniques like control
    flow and data flow analysis, model checking [21], property checking, reachability
    analysis and more, like synthesis [22], also in robotics and IoT contexts [23].
    Specifically, we use here the two Integrated Modelling Environments DIME and Pyrus.
    DIME is an Eclipse-based LC/NC graphical modelling environment that enables prototyping
    web applications in a model-driven way. It follows the OTA (One Thing Approach)
    [24] and the XMDD (eXtreme Model-Driven Design) [18] paradigms for modelling and
    development, empowering domain experts to model an end-to-end web application
    with no programming experience. To cover the different aspects of web applications,
    DIME provides a collection of ready-to-use modelling languages, as well as collections
    of native domain-specific languages (DSLs) that support the development of new
    applications via composing models of different natures. In particular, DIME allows
    users to define the data model, create the user interface models, and create the
    workflows. Those models are checked for syntactic compliance largely automatically
    (DIME can be downloaded from https://scce.gitlab.io/dime/ (accessed on 3 October
    2023)). Pyrus is a web application that offers a graphical, collaborative development
    environment for data analytics. It bridges the gap between Python-based established
    programming platforms like Jupyter [25] and graphical workflow composition in
    a data-flow fashion. Individual Python functions are implemented and stored in
    Jupyter, and special signature annotations are added to these functions and exported
    to Pyrus so that the functions can be identified and retrieved by the Pyrus web-based
    orchestration tool, where the pipelines are composed. From the pipelines, Pyrus
    generates the Python code for the orchestration and configuration, which is again
    stored and executed in Jupyter. This separation of concerns decouples the coding
    and development of the single functionalities (in Python/Jupyter), and the low-code
    part of the approach, from the data analytics orchestration modelling, which happens
    in accordance with model-driven engineering principles and completely graphically,
    in a no-code fashion. 3. Software Architecture for the MDD SmartAgri Application
    In this section, we present in detail the various steps of the LC/NC application
    design and implementation, covering our main contributions. Specifically, Section
    3.1 introduces the runtime architecture we adopted for the SmartAgri demonstrator,
    highlighting in particular the Digital Thread it contains. Section 3.2 showcases
    how we encapsulate Python and Java functionalities to reusable components: the
    SIBs, in the low-code aspect of the design methodology. Section 3.3 and Section
    3.4 show how the Digital Thread workflows are designed in Pyrus and DIME, respectively.
    This is the logic layer of the applications, and it is amenable to flexible reconfiguration
    in a no-code fashion. Section 3.5 discusses the option of extending the current
    architecture with machine learning on the edge, enabling edge-IoT. 3.1. The SmartAgri
    Architecture with Digital Thread Considering our case study and its components
    in this context, the system’s architecture for the SmartAgri demonstrator is shown
    in Figure 3. It is composed of three subsystems: Figure 3. The proposed SmartAgri
    runtime architecture. 1. the Agricultural Setup, consisting of the greenhouse
    equipped with the Nordic Thingy:53 sensors. The generated data streams from different
    sensors, such as light, temperature, pressure, humidity, and air quality. The
    Thingy:53 IoT package is composed of the IoT sensor device itself plus an associated
    app already developed by the Thingy team, where users can customise the sensor’s
    behaviour and manage the connectivity through different protocols (Bluetooth LE,
    WiFi, Zigbee, etc.) in order to gather the generated data. One of the downsides
    of using Thingy is that, in order to forward the data to another infrastructure,
    we need to build our custom firmware, so for now we have to upload our collected
    measurements to the database using a batch script. 2. the Analytics Pipeline:
    Once the data coming from the app are stored in the MongoDB Atlas database, the
    analytics pipeline designed in Pyrus retrieves them and generates the desired
    graphics and insights, enabling an informed decision making process and subsequent
    actuation. 3. the Digital Thread layer: a collection of DIME application DSLs
    define which functionalities the different tools provide. This enables the user
    to define how they communicate and interact. This happens through a collection
    of models that implement user interaction and the orchestration of the functionalities
    of the overall end-to-end system. Specifically, in the Digital Thread, the data
    are retrieved from MongoDB through the different REST API external DSLs, they
    are analysed through the Pyrus pipeline (in Python), and a dashboard is displayed
    in a web application defined in DIME, where the stakeholders can visualise the
    strategic information and make decisions. To ease understanding, we now provide
    a detailed description from the bottom up, starting from the components and their
    integration in DIME through external DSLs. 3.2. External DSLs: The Reusable SIBs
    The model-driven development environment used in this context, as mentioned before,
    already incorporates collections of predefined functionalities previously developed
    and tested. This simplifies the development cycle with different native components,
    such as those used for interaction with IoT devices (EdgeX [26]), MongoDB, and
    the integration of external services through REST using the external R services
    [27]. These DSLs provide convenient high-level abstractions that have a uniform
    syntax and representation. They help designers of new applications to focus on
    the “what” instead of the “how” of their own application. This means that developers
    can focus on the problem, developing the application logic instead of dealing
    with manual implementation details, and the code of the full application is generated
    from the models of the logic, data, and UI plus the DSLs, making the entire development
    lifecycle less prone to errors. The DSLs consist of collections of building blocks
    called SIBs (service-independent building blocks). Figure 4 shows the urlToJson
    SIB in DIME, which takes a URL and transforms it into JSON format. The SIB appears
    in the DSL in DIME as a graphical representation of an atomic SIB, with its name
    and its input/output signature (on the left). It is associated to DIME with a
    call to its implementation, in this case consisting of plain Java code (JDK 11)
    (on the right). In the code, the SIB developer has full control over the functionality
    and the implementation. The representation exposes the I/O and the parameters
    of the SIB, which makes it easy to reuse in different contexts by changing the
    parameters. The visual approach to application development makes the system development
    more user-friendly: developers simply drag and drop the corresponding components
    into the working area and compose the orchestrations and workflows this way, with
    full visibility and control of the control flow and the data flow. Figure 4. The
    native common SIBs urlToJson in DIME: SIB representation (left) and its corresponding
    native Java code (right). 3.3. The Analytics Pipeline in Pyrus To design and implement
    our analytics pipelines, we first use the Pyrus LC/NC environment. A DIME version
    leads to the results presentation shown in the figure in Section 4.4. Similar
    to DIME, Pyrus follows an LC/NC approach, but it is a pure data flow tool for
    analytics applications. As shown in Figure 5 for the cbor_to_json() function of
    the Pyrus pipeline, underneath each SIB, the implementation is in Python code.
    On the left, we see the SIB representation in Pyrus, including the SIB name and
    the input/output signature, and, on the right, we see the Python implementation
    with the signature annotations for Pyrus. We notice the one-to-one correspondence
    between the model I/O and the signature annotations augmenting the Python code.
    The implementation is standard Python. Figure 5. Pyrus: SIB representation of
    the cbor_to_json() function of the Pyrus pipeline. (a) The SIB representation
    in Pyrus. (b) The Python implementation with signature annotations. Figure 6 shows
    the web-based Pyrus workspace. On the left section, we see it visualise the folder
    structure of the project. The central canvas shows the workflow of the current
    pipeline itself, and underneath the canvas its properties, and the right section
    shows the SIB palette: these are the different SIBs that are ready and available
    for inclusion in the project. Figure 6. Pyrus: the user view of the web-based
    development environment. To implement the pipeline for our smart agriculture case
    study, some functionalities were missing and thus new SIBs were developed (code
    and SIB definition), and other existing SIBs needed to be customised in order
    to deal with new types of extensions, such as CBOR files (Concise Binary Object
    Representation), that were not supported in Pyrus so far. As shown in Figure 7,
    the thingy_53 palette is new, and contains among others a new SIB to convert the
    CBOR data to JSON. It is the same SIB whose representation and implementation
    are shown in Figure 5. Figure 7. Pyrus: the lists of SIBs in the Ecore palette.
    (a) Sample default SIBs in Pyrus, here the classification palette. (b) Custom
    SIBs used in Pyrus: the new thingy_53 palette. The entire preprocessing pipeline
    shown in the Pyrus canvas in Figure 6 (middle) is reported for clarity again in
    Figure 8. It consists of obtaining the input CBOR file, transforming it into JSON
    format, then creating a dictionary from that file, thus making the transition
    to a Pandas DataFrame [28] more straightforward, and finally plotting the data.
    The before/after display of the data structure is shown in Figure 9: on the left
    is the original JSON, and on the right is the final CSV data format. We can clearly
    see in this example the benefits of dealing with data structures compared to raw
    data. This user-friendly approach abstracts through Pyrus SIBs and Pyrus workflows
    the coding complexity we might find in a regular pure Python approach, and it
    boosts ease of understanding and reusability, where the system development is
    based on the easy composition of reusable pipeline components and models. See
    also Figure 10. Figure 8. Pyrus: the preprocessing and plotting pipeline. Figure
    9. The Thingy:53 datasets before (a) and after (b) the Pyrus preprocessing and
    plotting pipeline. (a) Test JSON data before processing in Pyrus. (b) Test CSV
    data after processing in Pyrus. Figure 10. Pyrus: results from the processing
    and plotting pipeline. 3.4. The Analytics Workflow in DIME The analytics workflow
    depicted in Figure 11 serves as a blueprint for a web application for conducting
    numerical and statistical data analysis. To initiate the workflow, the SIB connection_mongoDB
    dispatches instructions to the R server, alongside the necessary inputs: the connection
    string, database name, and collection name of the MongoDB database. The R environment,
    utilising the mongolite package, retrieves the dataset in JSON format and provides
    a file handler for the dataframe. Figure 11. DIME workflow: sample analytics dashboard
    using R in DIME. This file handler is then transmitted to the pre_processing SIB,
    along with the column names requiring segmentation. The R server proceeds to segment
    the primary dataframe into several sub-dataframes based on the specified inputs.
    In this instance, the sub-dataframes are R_lux, G_lux, B_lux, L_lux, Temperature_degC,
    pressure_KpA, humidity_%, and gas_res_MOhm, corresponding to the 8 sensors. These
    sub-dataframes are subsequently forwarded to the plot_chart SIB, each for a specific
    sensor. The generated plots are then shared with the analytics_dashboard’s GUI
    SIB, which in turn displays them on the web application dashboard. The solid arrows
    depict the control flow of the application, the dashed arrows the data flow, analogous
    to the Pyrus convention. This is the modelling level where the flexibility of
    the workflows plays a role: in case one wishes to modify the workflow, e.g., add
    processing steps, notifications, logging, etc., it is easy to add existing SIBs
    and “re-wire” the workflow graphically, without the need to master programming
    skills or a specific (set of) programming languages. This is the no-code aspect
    of the MDE software development paradigm. 3.5. ML on Edge Impulse One of the advantages
    of using the Thingy:53 device and the accompanying platform is the option to send
    the data to the cloud for data cleaning, feature selection, ML/deep learning (DL)
    modelling, ML/DL model evaluation, ML/DL model testing, and deploying the selected
    ML/DL model back on the Thingy device. The Edge Impulse platform shown in Figure
    12 is an LC/NC platform for defining workflows. Referred to as ‘impulses’, these
    workflows connect the data block containing the time series collected by the device
    to the data processing block, which then can be linked to the learning block for
    ML/DL model selection. Once the impulse is saved, these blocks have their own
    full-page options to configure through parameters details such as scaling, filtering,
    feature selection, as well as modelling parameters, such as epochs, batch size,
    number and type of layers in the neural network, etc. On the free version that
    is available to all, Edge Impulse can train a model for a maximum of 20 min training
    time, which seems a short time, but it allows for many IoT applications in various
    domains. One such application is the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) domain as
    discussed by Singh et al. [29], where the authors compared the performance of
    traditional ML modelling techniques to the DL methods available on Edge Impulse
    using the data collected using Thingy:53 devices. There, the training time limit
    of 20 min on Edge Impulse did not limit the options to train a DL model that compares
    in performance with the traditional ML models trained on local machines. Once
    more, data are collected for the different sensors utilised in this research,
    and a successful ML/DL modelling pipeline can be developed and then deployed back
    on the Thingy:53 device for live predictions on the edge. Figure 12. Edge Impulse:
    LC/NC workflows for data processing, analytics, and ML modelling. 4. Results and
    Discussion The main result is the demonstrator itself, as an application implemented
    with the new LC/NC technologies, that we can showcase to adopters, research exhibitions,
    and commercial fairs, and we can even bring it to schools or career days to attract
    younger students to choose a profession that is related to IoT and analytics.
    4.1. Modelling a Pipeline As mentioned previously, Pyrus provides functionality
    already developed and tested, and a no-code way to simplify the development process:
    by dragging and dropping the SIBs in our analytics pipelines. An example of this
    is shown in Figure 7a and Figure 7b, respectively, where we use functionality
    from the Pyrus core (fit data, plot, and predict) and developed customised functionality
    as well for our use case: an SIB for converting from CBOR format to JSON, an SIB
    to create a Python dictionary from data, another one to convert the dictionary
    into a Pandas dataframe, and the last one, a function to plot all our obtained
    data. The resulting dashboard produced by the Pyrus pipelines is shown in Figure
    8, which visualises the pipeline composition with the following stages: 1. Place
    the data file from the Thingy data_file.cbor into the system. The Thingy devices
    record data in CBOR format, which is unwieldy for our purpose. 2. We convert the
    CBOR data file to a more accessible JSON format using the cbor_to_json SIB, and
    save it in a JSON file. 3. Using the data_dict SIB, the JSON file is initialised
    as a Python dictionary, and the information that is not needed for data analysis
    is discarded. For example, the ID numbers for different sensors were discarded
    in favour of their names. 4. To obtain more precise context for the experiment,
    we clean the data by converting the time series format to Python datetime and
    initialise the dictionary as a Pandas DataFrame for ease of processing, storage,
    and plotting. This is achieved in the data_dict_to_df SIB. 5. Finally, we plot
    all the obtained data as shown in Figure 10. 4.2. Dashboard and Analytics In Figure
    10, only a subset of the dataset (corresponding to approximately 30 min) was taken
    for demonstration of the pipelines. The first three graphs titled R_lux, G_lux,
    and B_lux are from the colour sensor on the Thingy:53. These plots show the different
    colour values for the red, green, and blue channels, respectively. These values
    are important to consider, especially in a controlled environment like a greenhouse,
    because the growth of several plants is strongly related to the colour of the
    light exposed to them. The fourth graph in the figure is from the light sensitivity
    sensor and is used to measure the amount of light the plants are exposed to. The
    data from these four graphs can be used to find the most efficient wavelength
    a particular plant responds to or expose the plants to a certain light for a certain
    amount of time. The next three graphs in the figure titled temperature_degC, pressure_kPa,
    and humidity_% plot the measurements of temperature (in degrees Celsius), pressure
    (in kilopascal) and humidity (in percentage), respectively, in the greenhouse.
    These values can be tightly controlled by using heating, air conditioning, humidifiers,
    etc., to achieve the optimum growth for the plants. As indicated in the graphs,
    the temperature and humidity values fluctuated quite a bit, which meant that the
    greenhouse environment was not as tightly controlled as assumed beforehand. The
    last graph in the figure shows the measurements from the gas sensor and is necessary
    to evaluate the quality of air inside the greenhouse. 4.3. Limitations A few limitations
    with the Thingy:53 and its supported software stack emerged. For example, the
    device cannot directly upload to cloud storage, and it also needs the smartphone
    app to connect/control every basic functionality. To change this behaviour, as
    already mentioned, custom firmware would have to be written, which was outside
    the scope of our project. Another small but significant issue with the smartphone
    app is that the duration of data measurement had to be entered in milliseconds
    using increments/decrements of one millisecond. So, to set up the data collection
    for a 30 min duration, it would take around 15 min just to set the correct number
    in milliseconds. There was no way of directly entering the exact figure using
    the keyboard. This issue hindered the data collection step the most and could
    be solved with just a simple UI update from Thingy’s developers. 4.4. Flexibility
    From the point of view of observing and logging the changes in different parameters
    in the greenhouse, the current setup, including the Thingy:53, the smartphone
    app, Pyrus pipelines, and the DIME web app, was very successful. It was possible
    to observe and analyse the data from the different sensors in great detail. The
    results dashboard was produced by the Pyrus pipelines and fed into the DIME dashboard
    (Figure 13), enabling a more user-friendly, web-based approach. There, we chose
    to display only the red and green light channels, pressure, and humidity values
    as they were sufficient in order to monitor the environmental parameters in our
    greenhouse and to make decisions: for example, if the humidifier was to be turned
    on or not, or if the coloured lights were to be switched on or off, and so on.
    Figure 13. DIME: the smart agriculture sensor data dashboard as shown in the web
    application. With this new methodology for designing, implementing, and deploying
    applications, once having SIBs that conduct, for example, data cleansing, noise
    elimination, etc., for which we can reuse existing Python code or Java code and
    wrap it as shown in Section 2.4, the Digital Thread workflows designed in Pyrus
    and DIME constitute the logic layer of the applications. This logic layer is amenable
    to flexible reconfiguration in a no-code fashion to add, for example, alternative
    sub-workflows, e.g., for data cleansing, noise elimination, etc. 4.5. Reusability
    The produced SIBs, processes, and features like the Pyrus pipeline also have the
    chance to be reused: in a no-code fashion if reusable is possible as is, i.e.,
    no new coding is needed. This is the case if one applies the same Pyrus pipeline
    and DIME application to produce different plots if the input data are different.
    However, it is also the case if there is a redesign of either the Pyrus analytics
    pipeline or the DIME data collection, analytics orchestration, and dashboard application
    in case we have all the SIBs we need. Now that we have extended the DIME and Python
    SIBs to deal with several Nordic Thingy:53 data types and functionalities, we
    could create very different pipelines for different applications without the need
    of being able to program or master the software development lifecycle through
    subsystem integration and application deployment and provisioning. For example,
    if instead of providing the entire data plot of the luminosity or humidity we
    wanted only to expose the times above/below given thresholds (which may be needed
    to automate the decision making, and also easier to understand by a garden or
    greenhouse operator), we would modify the current Pyrus workflow by reusing already
    existing SIBs that handle data filtering regarding thresholds and display. in
    a LC fashion, if we wished, e.g., to extend the collection of Nordic Thingy:53
    functionalities integrated in DIME further, extending the corresponding DIME and/or
    Pyrus DSL in a fashion similar to what we completed so far. Here, we count on
    the powerful help of the examples of the current DSL in order to simplify this
    task: it is easier to create a new SIB on the basis of open-source SIB collections
    made available to the community of DIME and Pyrus users than to have to create
    it from scratch as we did. The reusability aspect, alongside the no-code feature
    of the development routine, makes it accessible for end-users who are not proficient
    in the use of programming languages. This trait not only helps speed up the development
    cycle for a simple data collection and analysis project for a small greenhouse
    but also democratizes the use of IoT sensors for all. Previous work has already
    been done in several domains utilising precursor technologies where we can witness
    the effectiveness of this approach. In the context of bioinformatics we can find
    for instance [30], in the Telecommunications domain [31], Robotics and IoT [23],
    and Decision support systems [32]. 5. Conclusions In this case study, we developed
    and deployed an edge analytics solution using a multi-sensor IoT platform that
    takes the data from greenhouse stores and analyses the different data streams
    we need. Through a Python script, we downloaded the data and stored them in a
    no-SQL database (MongoDB) in order for the Pyrus data analytics to create the
    individual sensor data graphics and provide them to the web application as elements
    to display in a dashboard for decision making, in our case for the greenhouse
    operation optimisation. We used DIME to orchestrate the overall web application,
    in particular to show the results, leveraging the already built-in DSLs and SIBs
    in our application design and implementation. Our innovative platforms and this
    development approach have the potential to greatly simplify the development and
    deployment of such applications. All the setups from the literature mentioned
    in Section 1.1 are complex and heterogeneous: they involve the integration of
    several technological layers working simultaneously to achieve efficient and cost-effective
    delivery of the different tasks and also require including various devices (actuators
    and nodes) with their different transfer protocols, dealing with orchestration
    challenges when trying to define the behaviour of the system. In this context,
    our approach simplifies the IT and integration tasks by composing models of behaviour
    to achieve the same results. By introducing different domain-specific languages
    (DSLs) as high-level abstraction for each behaviour and plugging them in, we enable
    a development cycle where stakeholders, instead of only defining requirements,
    can take action by participating actively in the successive stages of the project.
    LC application development environments make a great contribution to the underlying
    model-driven development and generative paradigms. They do so by facilitating
    the bootstrapping and composability of individual functional components, and,
    in this way, they make LC/NC an increasingly popular approach to planning, designing,
    and developing non-conventional heterogeneous Digital Thread ecosystems that include
    sensors and decision making based on more or less sophisticated analytics. The
    growing diversity in technical expertise needed in order to deliver high-tech
    solutions and processes in a conventional way, by direct manual coding, renders
    the idea of using these no-code alternatives increasingly attractive. Not only
    does it empower domain experts with no programming capabilities and make them
    full participants in the development process but it also reduces costs in terms
    of development speed, testing, deployment, and adoption. The next steps include,
    on the adoption and demonstration side, the uptake of the case study within the
    Confirm Irish Research Centre on Smart Advanced Manufacturing. This case study
    is in fact a practical demonstrator of the Digital Thread platform arising in
    the Confirm Research Hub on Cyberphysical Systems. Due to the strong importance
    of advanced agriculture in the Irish economy, with its global export of premium
    products, we have confirmation from many industry partners from the smart agriculture
    sector who are interested in these new software development technologies. Also,
    the new governmental initiatives towards mainstreaming organic farming, spanning
    both produce and livestock, have raised the interest and relevance of advanced
    real-time ambient and conditions monitoring for indoor and outdoor environments.
    Applications are, e.g., to reduce water and energy consumption as well as to reduce
    or eliminate the preventive use of pesticides and fertilisers. On the technical
    side, we intend to extend and refine the overall architecture for this application,
    in order to better enable the integration between the physical world (IoT multi-sensor
    device) and extend the analytics pipeline and the Pyrus/DIME dashboards. The largest
    challenge ahead is likely the firmware-level development needed to configure the
    Thingy in a more efficient way, and, finally, we intend to fine-tune the dashboard
    in order to enable better and smoother interaction with users. Author Contributions

  description: The global warming and climate change is a one of the main reason for
    shortage of water. Therefore, smart use of water resources is necessary for long-term
    sustainability. Among different large-scale water consumer industries, the agriculture
    is one of the key consumers. The utilized water in agriculture has polluted and
    not suitable to use. Therefore, optimization in water management systems in agricultural
    irrigation system is required. In this paper, we proposed an automated crop irrigation
    system. The system considers the real and live soil sensor readings for predicting
    the water treatment plan. On the other hand the weather condi tions have also
    been considered before initiating the water supply. Therefore, decision making
    function has been formulated. The decision making function requires the prediction
    of water treatment plan and also the future weather conditions. Therefore, for
    making accurate prediction ANN algorithm has been trained for performing prediction
    of both the facts. In addition, for making dataset more effective for training
    with the ML algorithm a pre-processing algorithm for soil moisture sensor data
    set has been proposed. The experiments have been carried out and a simulation
    has been done. Based on the obtained performance the proposed technique of weather
    prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provides higher accuracy 99.4%
    as compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM) which provides 95% accuracy. Additionally
    for soil conditions this algorithm results 88.4% accurate predictions. In addition,
    the training and decision making time of the system has also been evaluate which
    demonstrate the decision can be performed in a fraction of seconds. Finally, the
    training time is also found acceptable and the system only needs once to train
    on a location specific data.

    to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet,
    and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet.

    PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for
    the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak

    implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data
    being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed
    to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3. Hyperparameter values

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal
    curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (621KB)

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

  description: Pepper production is very important to Sarawak, especially to the rural
    community which supporting of about 67,000 rural pepper farmers. Currently, these
    farmers cultivate their farms using a conventional method that relies heavily
    on human labor and intuition. This method has proven to be time-consuming, a wastage
    of agriculture inputs, rely heavily on labor, and is non-proactive when it comes
    to pepper vines management. This paper is to study the use of smart farming by
    adopting digital agriculture using the internet of things (IoT) and unmanned aerial
    vehicles or drones (UAV) to monitor pepper vines farms, particularly on fertilisation
    management. The IoT and drone are used to collect environmental data such as soil
    humidity, air temperature, air humidity, and pH sensor, and drone are used to
    collect pepper vines' health status in terms of Normalize Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI). The data was then analysed using machine learning to reveal the
    interrelation between the variables that underlie the pepper vines production.
    In our analysis, we implemented Pearson correlation to show the relationship among
    selected variables in the project. Linear Regression machine learning is used
    to predict the usage of fertiliser for 20 pepper vines. To support decision-making,
    data visualization in term of graphical reports were presented in the cloud database.
    Short messaging and emails were sent to farmers when the pepper vines required
    attention in regard to soil moisture, pH, and irrigation requirements. The result
    of this analysis can support farmers in taking appropriate decisions and actions
    about their pepper vines management in terms of fertilization and irrigation.

    the world is likely to face water and therefore food shortages due to reasons
    such as global warming, population growth, the melting of glaciers, the destruction
    of agricultural lands over time or their use for different purposes, and environmental
    pollution. Although technological developments are important for people to live
    a more comfortable and safer life, it is also possible to reduce and even repair
    the damage to nature and protect nature itself thanks to new technologies. There
    is a requirement to detect abnormal water usage in agriculture to avert water
    scarcity, and an electronic system can help achieve this objective. In this research,
    an experimental study was carried out to detect water leaks in the field in order
    to prevent water losses that can occur in agriculture, where water consumption
    is the highest. Therefore, in this study, low-cost embedded electronic hardware
    was developed to detect over-watering by means of normal and thermal camera sensors
    and to collect the required data, which can be installed on a mobile agricultural
    robot. For image processing and the diagnosis of abnormal conditions, the collected
    data were transferred to a personal computer server. Then, software was developed
    for both the low-cost embedded system and the personal computer to provide a faster
    detection and decision-making process. The physical and software system developed
    in this study was designed to provide a water leak detection process that has
    a minimum response time. For this purpose, mathematical and image processing algorithms
    were applied to obtain efficient water detection for the conversion of the thermal
    sensor data into an image, the image size enhancement using interpolation, the
    combination of normal and thermal images, and the calculation of the image area
    where water leakage occurs. The field experiments for this developed system were
    performed manually to observe the good functioning of the system. Keywords: robotics;

    water supply and the consumption of water in the world is increasing, and access
    to water of good quality is becoming more difficult over time [1]. As a result
    of the decrease in the available water resources day by day and the excessive
    use of water, this demand is reaching a point that cannot be met [2,3]. Especially,
    as seen in Figure 1, a large amount of water is used in agricultural areas, and
    it becomes a necessity to use it in the most efficient way. Considering the future
    of the world and the inadequacy of people’s food resources, one of the solutions
    to minimize losses for the most efficient use of water resources is water saving
    [4,5]. Today, this event has become strategic for countries as well as for producers.
    Countries should take the necessary measures and make plans by making legal arrangements
    in this regard to ensure the continuity of their future and the needs of their
    citizens. It is not the right approach to look at it only in terms of food and
    water. For the world, which is expected to reach a population of 9.7 billion in
    2050, the correct use of resources is a social and economic necessity [6]. In
    some regions and countries, the use of advanced technologies, especially in agriculture,
    has become a necessity, while in some regions, funds have been provided for studies
    on this subject from both national resources and foundations and unions. Over
    time, the development of the world has passed through various stages of industry.
    With the fourth industrial revolution, especially as a result of the integration
    of communication systems with control systems, a wide variety of application types
    in different application areas have appeared. With the use of Industry 4.0 applications
    and digitalization in the field of agriculture, Agriculture 4.0 has emerged [7].
    Thanks to Agriculture 4.0 applications, it is now possible to create proactive
    and more efficient systems that can remotely monitor and/or control [8]. This
    is becoming a necessity; otherwise, insufficient water and food will cause disasters
    and chaos in the world. In order to prevent this situation, different technologies
    and many papers on this subject have been put forward [9]. While technological
    developments support many areas in agriculture, the control of the land with satellites
    [10,11,12], the control of data in cloud environments [13,14,15], the Internet
    of Things (IoT) [16,17,18,19,20], computer vision with the development of imaging
    systems, machine learning, and algorithms have started to be used intensively
    in agriculture [21,22,23]. In addition, information from all these studies have
    been collected and analyzed and studied using big data [24,25,26]. Thus, production
    is not considered only as instant harvest, and every piece of information received
    is used to make production more efficient. Today, this issue is not only considered
    for professional or large systems, but is also designed for lower-budget areas
    due to advancing software and electronic environments [27]. As can be seen, there
    are many studies and articles on this subject. The abundance of studies has also
    become a separate subject of study [28]. Figure 1. Evolution of global water withdrawals,
    1900–2018 (km3/year) [3]. With the effective use of technology in agriculture,
    both the quality and quantity of products increase. It is not correct to limit
    the use of technology only to production. In order to increase quality and production,
    appropriate planting, fertilization, irrigation, and harvesting conditions should
    be provided [29,30,31,32]. These conditions can be controlled by human hands up
    to a point. However, the size of the land, the growing conditions of the product,
    climatic conditions, and the necessity of high-quality production will cause manpower
    to be insufficient at some point. Moreover, acting in a classical agriculture
    approach will cause the late detection of diseases, inadequate and inefficient
    use of equipment, and a high amount of manpower. Therefore, controlled agriculture
    is inevitable [33]. Fully controlled systems are seen in the field day by day.
    Even systems that control the irrigation system are being designed and implemented
    [34] to prevent errors. Small producers have started to use these systems to the
    extent that they are able. Especially in harvesting and irrigation, automation
    systems have reached small producers. In this study, we focused on the design
    and development of electronic hardware equipped with a camera and thermal sensors
    to detect irrigation anomalies, which can be installed on a mobile robotic structure
    that scans the land area where irrigation faults occur, which are of great importance
    in agricultural production. It is very important for the quality and quantity
    of the product to irrigate the land at appropriate time schedules and to ensure
    the moisture content of the plant at the required times during the period from
    planting to harvest. Irrigation does not only consist of releasing water to the
    land. It can be provided by giving water to the product or soil using different
    methods at different times. In this case, the technique and control of irrigation
    differs. During production, the humidity of the soil, plant, or air should be
    monitored according to the type of irrigation, and it should be checked whether
    the irrigation is proceeding well or not. Furthermore, although irrigation can
    be performed with automatic systems, it is also crucial to know which automatic
    irrigation system will be used. Irrigation control strategies should be determined,
    and control mechanisms should be put forward accordingly. Bwambale et al. [35],
    who have conducted a good study on this subject, have defined control strategies
    in Figure 2. These control methods are mostly applied in the field. From the most
    basic method of the manual control of irrigation to the most advanced intelligent
    control, the purpose does not change. Providing water according to the product
    not only increases the quality but also provides savings [36]. Apart from this,
    it is also important which crop to choose, as well as where to plant it. In this
    way, we have the chance to make decisions about irrigation techniques [37,38].
    It is not desirable to have an excessive or inadequate amount of water in the
    field than expected. The issue is the problems that can occur even when we do
    everything right. Considering that irrigation can be controlled in the field using
    any method shown in Figure 2, things do not always continue as expected. The larger
    the area, the more difficult it is to control every point of the control systems.
    Irrigation may not proceed as expected due to installation errors, malfunctions
    due to the dynamic operation of irrigation systems, weather conditions, damage
    caused by creatures that are not under control in the field, or damage to irrigation
    systems by conscious or unconscious people. In such cases, the water consumed
    at the irrigation point may be normal, but the irrigation point may shift, and
    the plant may be damaged. Therefore, it is necessary to scan water leaks in the
    field with mobile systems at certain time intervals. This study is not about predicting
    the water leakage problem beforehand; it is about creating an alarm so that the
    involved people can solve the problem in a short time to prevent water deficiency
    or excess. Even if problems can be detected by sampling methods, the reaction
    time after the occurrence of problems is expected to be minimum. Late reaction
    may cause irreversible losses in some cases. Increasing the number of sampling
    points in order to reduce losses will cause unnecessary costs [39]. Figure 2.
    Classification of irrigation control strategies. Reprinted/adapted with permission
    from Ref. [35]. It would be optimistic to expect everything to proceed well. The
    establishment of security or control systems to ensure that the installed systems
    work without errors will eliminate such problems. At this stage, it is also necessary
    to understand how irrigation is performed. After the water is controlled at the
    desired point in the field, irrigation is monitored by different methods as shown
    in Figure 3 to understand whether everything is proceeding well in the agricultural
    area. Figure 3. Monitoring methods in smart irrigation. Reprinted/adapted with
    permission from Ref. [35]. Considering that fixed systems cannot react to unexpected
    problems, additional systems are needed to recognize faults. Therefore, instead
    of fixed systems, mobile systems that control the terrain will be more efficient.
    The proposed electronic hardware and software for image processing in this study,
    such as for water leakage detection, was designed considering its integration
    with such a future mobile robotic structure. With this approach, it is possible
    to identify the common problem areas, including water ponding, and mark them for
    manual or automatic resolution while moving around the land area. In the introduction,
    we mentioned an effective agricultural irrigation system and method for minimizing
    the water leakage, especially to be used in smart agriculture robotics. In the
    next section, general information will be given on agricultural irrigation control
    strategies, monitoring systems, control methods, and the proposed system design.
    The system design covers thermal sensors, a camera, and an ESP32-CAM Wi-Fi Bluetooth
    Development Board. In section three, the results of the study will be given. The
    results include image data transfer from the camera and thermal sensor, data processing
    by the server, and water area detection. In the final section, the conclusions
    and discussion will be given. The layout of the study is given in Figure 4. Figure
    4. The layout of the study. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Agricultural Irrigation
    Control Strategies Today, the decrease in freshwater resources has made it obligatory
    to use water sparingly. To this aim, irrigation systems suitable for the type
    of product, climatic conditions, size and conditions of the land, and geographical
    conditions of the land are used. Irrigation in agricultural production is performed
    by natural means or by human hands. Natural irrigation relies on timing with respect
    to weather conditions, often leaving it to chance. Although this method is a very
    primitive method and has a direct effect on the quantity and quality of the product,
    insufficient or excessive irrigation can cause damage that will leave the producer
    in a difficult situation. However, the producer can be organized to minimize these
    undesirable situations using monitoring systems. Although excessive irrigation
    can damage the plant, there is basically no unknown situation in the field. In
    short, since irrigation is not adequately controlled, it is unnecessary to prevent
    it or to check whether there is excess water by travelling to various points of
    the land. In man-made systems, irrigation is carried out by considering the plant’s
    need for water. Here, water can be provided directly to the plant, or it can be
    provided in very close proximity to the plant in a way that it can reach the roots
    of the plant. The application depends a little bit on the possibilities available
    on the land. Accordingly, agricultural irrigation is realized using three different
    methods. While some of these methods are controlled by modern systems, some of
    them are not controlled much due to the advantages of land conditions. It is possible
    to see these in Figure 5 [40,41]. Figure 5. Irrigation methods. Surface irrigation
    systems are systems where irrigation is performed by utilizing the conditions
    of the land. Here, water moves along a natural slope and flows into canals. Water
    is provided to the plant by ponding on the land. This method, called “basin” or
    “flood” irrigation, which is widely used in classical agriculture, is a method
    that can cause the excessive expenditure of water and evaporation. In this method,
    water saving is not often pursued [42]. Water is released to the land, and it
    is assumed that the soil receives the water it can take. Excess water is either
    lost by evaporation or it finds its way into the soil and disappears before reaching
    the plant. According to the studies on farmer preference, the producer mostly
    prefers this method because of the product need, because it is easy, or out of
    necessity [43]. In subsurface irrigation, water is provided to the roots by the
    effect of capillary forces (capillarity) under the soil. It has been determined
    that this method provides significant benefits to plant development, and while
    there is a great decrease in the amount of water used, it causes extra investments,
    and different problems may occur due to unused elements in the water [44,45].
    Another method is pressurized irrigation. Here, water is delivered to the plant
    by increasing the pressure to a certain value. The pressure is created by mechanical
    systems or by delivering water to the plants from a point potentially higher than
    the irrigation point. Water is usually delivered to the plants either as drip
    irrigation or with the help of springs according to the type of product. In this
    system, water is used more efficiently than in the basin irrigation system. When
    considering irrigation efficiency, it is not advisable to accumulate excessive
    water at a single point or to interrupt the planned watering process, which ensures
    that the plants receive an adequate amount of water during irrigation. Doing so
    may lead to plants being left without water. As in Figure 3, we can try to avoid
    this problem by controlling irrigation using the methods described by Bwambale
    et al. [35]. Although smart systems constantly control the land and try to provide
    water according to the thirsty plant or soil, it does not matter how much water
    you provide when there is a problem with the irrigation, because the necessary
    amount of water will not reach the desired point. In such systems, the necessary
    sensors can partially detect this problem. Our goal here, obviously, is pressurized
    systems that can be controlled. The basin irrigation system is not overly concerned
    with water conservation. In subsurface irrigation systems, it may not always be
    possible to detect water leaks. Using the method in the system we designed, we
    tried to detect leaks in drip irrigation systems. Water was found naturally outside
    the plant, as irrigation was delivered to every point of the system by sprinklers.
    Therefore, problem detection in irrigation with sprinklers could not be realized
    with the designed system. 2.2. Monitoring Systems Considering the monitoring systems
    depicted in Figure 3, two potential scenarios arise within the system being examined:
    irrigation is either excessive or insufficient. The excess of irrigation is manifested
    by its appearance in the soil in an area different from the plant, while the lack
    of irrigation is manifested by the poor development of the plant. Irrigation in
    modern systems is carried out in open and closed loops. In open loops, irrigation
    is provided to the system on a time or volume basis. Whether the irrigation is
    proceeding correctly in the field is either determined by the employees or ensured
    by the sensors in the field. Whether adequate irrigation is carried out in these
    systems, whether on a time or volume basis, is mostly based on the crop, using
    the sampling method, and utilizing experience. In closed loops, fuzzy logic [46,47],
    PID irrigation control [48], neural networks [49,50,51], linear quadratic systems
    [52], evolutionary algorithms [53], and hybrid systems are used to control irrigation
    and ensure the most efficient irrigation. In these systems, irrigation is performed
    according to the condition of the plant, soil, and climate. In addition, drainage
    water is utilized in irrigation when required, and the accuracy of irrigation
    is controlled. In this type of system, there are natural mechanisms to prevent
    unnecessary water loss. However, these mechanisms will be of secondary importance
    as watering will take priority when the plant signals insufficient water. In some
    cases, water loss may not be detected by the algorithms or may be detected too
    late. For these reasons, the control of irrigation, whether by an open- or closed-loop
    system, should be conducted using not only algorithms but also control mechanisms
    implemented at the farthest endpoints. This means sensors at many points in the
    field. The sensors to be used can continuously control the soil moisture, pH balance,
    and salt ratio, and can inform the system and detect errors. These devices are
    frequently used today. In the example system in Figure 6, a central control system
    and remote end units evaluate the data coming from RTUs, such as soil salt, pH,
    and humidity, and operate their valves and motors according to the parameters
    determined by the server or the panel on the controller. In addition, controller
    parameters and RTU (remote terminal unit) values are stored in the cloud environment,
    which can be accessed by mobile devices and when necessary, authorized persons
    can intervene from outside the field. Figure 6. An example supervisory data acquisition
    and control system. Naturally, in this system, there is a need for enough sensors
    to operate and control the entire system without error. The fact that all RTUs
    can talk to the CPU eliminates the possibility of being wired due to changes in
    production periods and products in practice. Therefore, the system should be built
    on wireless networks. Moreover, additional devices will also be required to act
    as repeaters if the distance between the sensors or the control center is exceeded.
    Even with all these systems installed and working perfectly, there is no guarantee
    that there will be no problems, and if there are, additional mechanisms will be
    needed to pinpoint the exact location of the problem. It may be possible to avoid
    the problems associated with traditional systems by adding mobile robot technology.
    Mobile robots travelling around the field and detecting the point where the leakage
    is located is the most suitable solution for the system to work properly. This
    avoids situations that the controller software does not recognize as errors. 2.3.
    The Control Method After identifying the problem and the solution steps, it is
    necessary to determine how to solve it. The main question is how the control system
    investigates the land and detects the problem. It should be noted here that this
    process must be performed both quickly and accurately. After all, wrong decisions
    cost time and money when looking for a fault that needs intervention. In this
    sense, it should be considered what happens when there is an error in irrigation.
    If there is a blockage at the irrigation point, then water cannot reach the plant
    and causes anomalies in plant growth. These abnormalities, often called stress,
    are usually caused by heat, but mineral deficiencies, cold and frost effects,
    and other factors have also been found to cause them [54]. The most important
    of the other factors is the lack of water. Moreover, water excess also causes
    stress. In Figure 7, an example water leakage problem can be seen. In the view
    of plant furrows, the leakage area causes excess water, which is a problem for
    the nearest plant, and triggers a lack of water for the subsequent plants in the
    line of the water furrow. In the detailed view of the problematic area, the plants
    experiencing water deficiency can be seen. Figure 7. Example water leakage. (a)
    Plant furrow view. (b) Detailed plant view. If the water does not reach the desired
    points, then it can be determined that the calculated water has not reached the
    plants by reviewing the algorithms that determine the water and drainage water
    provided in closed systems. In addition, the deformation of the irrigation canal
    at a point means that the water will not move from this point and will accumulate
    and pond. In this case, the plants here remain in contact with excess water and
    become stressed again. In the continuation of the water channel, plants that cannot
    be contacted by water are stressed due to drought. Again, advanced systems can
    recognize this problem from drainage or by seeing an unexpected increase in water.
    Although it can be determined by monitoring systems whether water goes into the
    land more or less than desired, where the problem is or when it will be noticed
    are important considerations. Mobile systems come into play in this case. They
    can determine whether everything is proceeding well by travelling around the field
    when the problem occurs or before the problem occurs. Moreover, when they find
    the problem, they can intervene as soon as possible by informing the central system.
    It is important to define what the mobile system looks for in the field and how
    it searches. In short, to know how the mobile system detects the problem in the
    field is required. If we consider that the water supply to the plant in the land
    is cut off when there is a problem, then finding the cut-off point means finding
    the problem. For this, it is necessary to find the point where the water accumulated.
    If the designed mobile system detects the area where water accumulates in the
    field or where there is more moisture than expected, then it will naturally detect
    the source of the problem. For this, detecting excess moisture in the soil solves
    the problem in the fastest and most accurate way. However, this raises the question
    of how quickly moisture detection using moisture meters will solve the problem.
    Considering the size of the field, the question of how many points the moving
    vehicle will have to examine if it stops at one point and starts moisture measurement
    is also important because it will cause a loss of time. In this study, the problems
    encountered in drip irrigation, which is one of the most widely used systems in
    agricultural irrigation, is discussed. Although the technique to be used can support
    the capillary method with some subsurface water, trials have not been carried
    out in this kind of irrigation system. The reason for choosing this irrigation
    system is that it is the most widely used system, but also the one with the possibility
    of problems. Since the detection of irrigation leaks will be slow due to the need
    for long-term measurements using humidity sensors, faster humidity detection using
    a thermal camera while moving represents the difference in this study. Water excess
    can easily be found and confirmed using image processing thanks to the powerful
    microcontrollers of today. In this regard, another approach by Farkas was the
    method of irrigation control using the stress effects on the plant and computer
    vision [55]. However, what we do here will identify the soil where there is a
    water leakage, and the plant stress method is not required to achieve our goal.
    2.4. The System Design A camera, thermal sensor, and microprocessor were used
    in the mobile electronic system design. The data from the camera and the thermal
    sensor were transferred to the server via the microprocessor and processed there.
    Here, the camera and thermal sensor received the same image from the area investigated,
    which eased the decision making regarding the detection of water excess. Below,
    the system components will be explained separately. 2.4.1. Thermal Sensor In this
    study, AMG 8833, which is an 8 × 8 array thermal sensor that can act as a camera,
    was used to track thermal traces for a purpose-built structure. The thermal sensor
    specifications are in Table 1. This temperature sensor sends a temperature value
    that can create a representative image of 64 pixels. The readings are easily acquired
    using the I2C serial protocol. Although it is referred to as a camera, the resulting
    data are sensor values in the temperature range of 0 °C to 80 °C (+32 °F to +176
    °F). The result of the software is that the 64 generated datapoints are converted
    into an 8 × 8-pixel image. Table 1. AMG8833 Infrared Array Sensor specifications,
    Grid EYE 8 × 8 Preference [56]. The biggest reason for using this sensor is that
    it fully meets the temperature to be utilized in the field. In addition, the communication
    protocol used is the well-known I2C, which is generally used for effective serial
    communication between sensors and microcontrollers. The fact that many microcontrollers
    support this protocol has been effective in the selection of the sensor. In addition,
    its stable operation and good price/performance ratio also played a positive role
    in the selection. However, the low matrix value of the sensor, such as 8 × 8,
    is its disadvantage. Although it is possible to use this sensor directly, it can
    easily be interfaced with microprocessors using breakout boards. The breakout
    board simplifies system integration by providing soldering, serial addressing,
    and assembly. Although there are many software libraries that can be used with
    this sensor, the code has been written using the sensor datasheet instructions
    for better software integration and faster execution. In addition, the reading
    angle of the sensor being 60° is another issue to be considered for selecting
    the required view distance. 2.4.2. Camera The OV2640 color image sensor is used
    in the design as a camera. This camera has a 2 MPixel resolution with a total
    image array of 1632 × 1232 pixels. However, a lower resolution of 320 × 240 pixels
    was used in the design to ensure processing speed. The main features used in the
    OV2640 image sensor are 10-bit A/D converters and a digital signal processor (DSP),
    with a UXGA/XGA resolution of 15 fps, SVGA 30 fps, and CIF 60 fps allowing images
    to be taken. It also allows for automatic image control functions including automatic
    exposure control (AEC), automatic gain control (AGC), automatic white balance
    (AWB), automatic band filter (ABF), and automatic black-level calibration (ABLC)
    of the image. The main reason for using this camera sensor in this study is that
    it comes with this breakout hardware and is compatible with the ESP32 processor.
    In this way, the connections of the camera can easily be made using the socket
    on the breakout [57]. 2.4.3. ESP32-CAM Wi-Fi Bluetooth Development Board In this
    study, the images were not processed on the microprocessor but transferred to
    the server and analyzed there. To ensure real-time data processing on the server,
    a high data transfer rate and appropriate communication distance were planned.
    Furthermore, given the system’s mobility requirements, it was designed to achieve
    low weight and high energy efficiency. These design choices were made to facilitate
    the transfer of the system to lightweight robots, such as drones, in the next
    stage of the study. Although there are numerous microprocessors or controllers
    that could be used for this purpose, the ESP32-CAM [58] was chosen as it contains
    all the necessary components. The presence of the Wi-Fi module, the camera module,
    and SD card socket for data recording meet the requirements of this study. Additionally,
    the availability of multiple data communication protocols is valuable for adding
    new sensors and creating new wireless interfaces in the future. The board can
    be programmed in languages such as C and supports a variety of other languages
    such as MicroPython [59]. 3. Results In the designed system (Figure 8), the data
    from the camera and thermal sensor were collected in the ESP32-CAM and transferred
    to the server computer via Wi-Fi and processed there. The developed server software
    was able to detect water leakage that occurred during irrigation by analyzing
    camera data. Thus, the use of thermal cameras instead of traditional humidity
    sensors was successfully implemented in detecting water leaks. The transfer of
    the images to the server, processing on the server, and the results of the experimental
    study will be presented below. Figure 8. Schematic representation of the system.
    3.1. Transferring Images Using ESP32-CAM There are two different pieces of information
    received by the mobile system. The first is the data from the camera and the other
    is the data from the thermal sensor. The data from the camera have direct video
    images. These images can be viewed directly using its software library without
    any processing. The thermal sensor data consist of float-type values loaded in
    two bytes with a resolution of twelve bits, as shown in Table 2. The first eleven
    bits of these data denote the data values, whereas the twelfth bit specifies whether
    the number is positive or negative. The thermal sensor data with an 8 × 8 array,
    128 datapoints between addresses 0x80–0xFF in total, are combined as 64 float
    type numeric data in list type. The video images were transmitted to the server
    via web server port 81 and the thermal sensor data were transmitted via web socket
    port 82 through two different channels over the wireless network. Table 2. Temperature
    information of a pixel coming from the thermal sensor [40]. Video images and thermal
    data can also be sent from the same port, but the two-channel transfer method
    was used because distinguishing these two types of data and analyzing them on
    different devices was necessary. The video image from the camera was sent in 320
    × 240-pixel resolution. This information and all the setting parameters of the
    OV2640 can be adjusted by changing the parameters on the server PC if required.
    The thermal sensor data comprised a total of 256 bytes of data, but the first
    128 bytes contained data not needed for the image operation, such as interrupts,
    thermistor output values, etc. The remaining 128 bytes contained the necessary
    thermal image data, and after the data acquisition of these 128 bytes by ESP32-CAM,
    the server transferring was initiated. These operations were implemented using
    the algorithm shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. ESP32-CAM program algorithm. 3.2. Data
    Processing on the Server The data transferred to the server from two different
    ports were processed separately here, while the data were combined and visualized
    to ensure consistency. The initial 8 × 8-pixel image represented 64 numerical
    variables consisting of temperature values. A color scale with 64 temperature
    levels was established to visualize the image. The first color in the scale represented
    the lowest temperature, while the last color represented the highest temperature.
    Although the thermal sensor can measure in the range of 0–80 °C, it is not necessary
    to use the entire range for the temperature values to be measured in this study.
    The land is not expected to be as low as 0 °C during the sowing and harvesting
    period, and a maximum of 80 °C is not possible in the sown area even on the hottest
    days. Therefore, in this study, the temperature range was determined as 25–45
    °C. As mentioned above, the lowest temperature color showed 25 °C, while the highest
    temperature color showed 45 °C. In this way, the 64 incoming datapoints were converted
    into 64 color values according to the temperature value. After that, an 8 × 8-pixel
    image was formed consisting of colors by arranging the 64 datapoints in an 8 ×
    8 array format. However, this size of image is insufficient for image processing
    and is too small to interpret. Therefore, the image was enlarged to a resolution
    of 320 × 240 pixels using the OpenCV [60] interpolation method successfully. Here,
    the bicubic interpolation [61] method was preferred for expanding the image area
    by fitting the proper value for newly added pixels. In this method, during the
    resampling of the image, it is reconstructed by selecting the nearest neighboring
    pixel values to the gaps. Although this method is a little slower in terms of
    computational speed when compared to the other methods, this difference is not
    noticeable for the purpose of this study. The mathematical model used for interpolation
    is shown in Equation (1) [62]: p(𝑥,𝑦)= ∑ 𝑖=0 3 ∑ 𝑗=0 3 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑗 (1) It is
    incorrect to assume that every irrigation point is a leaking point. To avoid such
    a situation, it is also important to consider the location and size of the leakage
    point. In the case where an 8 × 8-pixel image is used, due to the low resolution,
    not every anomaly observed will potentially indicate a water leak. With the interpolation
    method applied, the 8 × 8-pixel image becomes sufficiently clear and visually
    useful. Thus, when the image resolution is increased, it is appropriate to evaluate
    whether the irrigated area has received more water than necessary by calculating
    the area from the measurement points. For this, the calculation of the area where
    the water spreads using the contour’s calculation in OpenCV can be made from the
    image. If this area is more than the desired size, then it is evaluated as leakage;
    otherwise, it is considered normal irrigation. 3.3. Experimental Study For the
    experimental study, an area irrigated with the basic drip irrigation technique
    was selected in the field. The condition of the soil was dry, and the weather
    condition was hot and not very humid at the time of the test. As shown in Figure
    10, a sample normal irrigation hole and a sample defective irrigation hole were
    created on the irrigation pipe in the test area. A properly functioning irrigation
    hole provides sufficient water to the plant, and this irrigation pattern is indicated
    by the green-colored marking. Abnormal watering, on the other hand, releases more
    water than is needed, resulting in water leakage, which is indicated by the red-colored
    marking. Figure 10. Test area (red circle: water leakage point, green circle:
    normal watering point). The video image stream of the points in the selected test
    area was taken with the system prepared as shown in Figure 11. In addition, real-time
    thermal images were also captured via web socket at these points. Figure 11. Test
    points. (a) Water leakage point. (b) Normal watering point. The Figure 12 shows
    thermal images of leakage and normal watering conditions at test points. Figure
    12. Test points thermal image (The colors represent heat level, blue: cold, red:
    hot). (a) Water leakage point. (b) Normal watering point. Naturally, each image
    taken must have the same distance to the test point. This is due to the need to
    ensure the consistency of the results of the measurements. Otherwise, i.e., if
    each measurement area is selected with a different height, then the leakage point
    may not be detected, or normal irrigation points may be misinterpreted as leakage
    points. Since the distance between the furrow was 0.65 m and the camera’s angle
    of view was 60°, the distance (height) from the soil level was calculated as approximately
    0.6 m from the division of half of 0.65 m to the tangent of half of 60°. In this
    study, since there were no obstacles in the field and there were no plants on
    it, it was possible to take the measurements manually from a pre-calculated height
    of 0.6 m. In this measurement, by superimposing thermal data and normal camera
    images captured from the video feed of the OV2640 camera sensor in the software,
    faulty irrigation points in the soil were more clearly revealed (Figure 13). Figure
    13. Combination of thermal image and video image (The colors represent heat level,
    blue: cold, red: hot). (a) Water leakage point. (b) Normal irrigation point. The
    operation of the designed system was verified and tested using a reference thermal
    sensor module currently available on the market (Figure 14). A temperature difference
    was evident between the irrigated and dry areas as shown in the figure. Figure
    14. Control with another thermal sensor. (a) Water leakage point. (b) Normal irrigation
    point. What needs to happen after obtaining these images is to determine which
    image represents leakage and which image represents normal irrigation. As can
    be seen in Figure 15, this is the process of calculating the area from thermal
    images with the contourArea command in OpenCV. Here, which is labelled as water
    leakage and which is normal irrigation can be determined according to a parameter
    to be determined. Figure 15. Field control of test irrigation points (The colors
    represent heat level, blue: cold, red: hot). (a) Water leakage point. (b) Normal
    irrigation point. When the water leakage area is detected, the point where the
    leakage is located can be marked by the mobile system, GPS coordinates can be
    recorded, or the user can be informed via a generated alarm message. 4. Discussion
    The importance of this study is to obtain better irrigation in agricultural areas
    with the help of detecting the leakage of water. The leak is detected using the
    thermal anomalies occurring in the irrigation area. It has been proven that this
    is possible using a camera and thermal sensor together with the proper arrangements
    in the agricultural area. It is indisputable that this method is both cheap and
    fast compared to other humidity control methods. In addition, the sensors required
    for the operation of the system are cost-effective and easy to use in this study.
    Leakage control with thermal cameras produce a faster and more flexible solution
    than temperature and humidity sensors. The conventional water sensors that detect
    one-dimensional signals require a long measurement time in the order of minutes
    for a consistent measurement. This may not be a suitable solution as it extends
    the process of scanning agricultural land for water. Monitoring a single physical
    variable would also not provide flexibility in terms of multi-tasking compared
    to a camera. In addition, with the use of cameras, not only water leakage detection
    but also other image-recognition-based studies can be carried out in the field.
    Larger areas can be scanned with more advanced electronic systems. In this way,
    control can be carried out even faster. If these systems are combined with autonomous
    multi-robots, then control in larger fields can be provided with great ease. It
    is possible to design this autonomous system to be used with a wheeled land vehicle
    moving on the ground as well as with the help of drones moving in the air. While
    designing the system, the land selected was determined as areas where there was
    no vegetation or very small vegetation. In addition, the reaction of the system
    to dense plantings or large plants has not been studied. In dense vegetation cases,
    both detecting water leakage using thermal imaging and the deployment of ground
    or aerial mobile robots carrying the thermal imager will be challenges to address
    for future works. The measurements here were acquired with a simple moving mechanism
    to keep the height of the camera and thermal image constant at a height of 0.6
    m and to keep the viewpoint unchanged. The aim of this study was to test the functionality
    of the designed and realized electronic diagnostic system. The fully controlled
    and autonomous structure of the system will be addressed in the next iteration.
    It is foreseen that there may be some problems with leakage control in thermal
    system. For example, it is thought that there may be erroneous readings due to
    the structure of the vegetation and that the shadows of large plants may cause
    errors in the readings. It is also considered that the thermal sensor may miss
    temperature anomalies in the soil due to the surrounding ambient temperatures
    in very hot weather during operation, although not very often. 5. Conclusions
    and Future Works The detection of water leakage was studied, and successful results
    were obtained on the use of water resources efficiently for agricultural irrigation
    purposes. A low-cost computerized embedded system was designed to collect image
    and thermal sensor data to evaluate the soil wetness conditions. Here ESP32-CAM
    was the main embedded computing module combined with an OV2640 camera module.
    The thermal sensor selected was the easy-to-use and low-cost AMG8833 8 × 8 array
    thermal sensor. The sensor data were transferred to a personal computer using
    wireless data transfer to evaluate the water condition. With the help of the normal
    camera sensor and proper interpolation method, the resulting thermal image was
    obtained successfully on the PC side. The evaluation and decision phases were
    realized on the resulting image using the greater computer processing power of
    cloud computing. Thus, the detection of water leakage was achieved. The main aim
    was to observe the system’s functionality and prove that the combined normal and
    thermal images worked for water leakage detection. Here, the challenges with algorithms
    in the aspect of software development were well overcame. The system’s statistical
    performance, which is not quite possible to test manually, can be evaluated when
    the system is placed on an automatic scanning mobile robot. Future work will cover
    the intensive tests of the developed system of this study. As a future work, in
    addition to the detection of leaks from thermal images in the leak detection study,
    the data from the camera can be processed by new machine-learning software running
    on the server. Thus, this new software can be used to confirm that the temperature
    change in the soil is due to water leakage. For this, a dataset will be prepared
    to train test images and a model will need to be created. With this model, more
    precise decisions can be made by examining the objects, not only depending on
    the data from the thermal sensor. This helps the thermal system with both dense
    plants and complex terrain samples. In addition, in this way, the thermal system
    prevents the object recognition system from making the wrong decision and helps
    make the right decision. Apart from this, the thermal system eliminates the misinterpretation
    of the image coming to the camera for the dataset as the effect of shadow or light
    during the movement of the mobile system in the field. Another future work will
    be about automated data acquisition using a ground agriculture robot and potentially
    a drone robot to obtain automated scans of the agricultural land. This automatic
    robotic system will also allow the sensor data acquisition process to be more
    reliable when compared with the manual approach. It is also possible to obtain
    the current navigation position if required, in addition to the identification
    of the problem. If this system is placed on a robot that scans a given area, then
    the location of a water problem could be obtained automatically by considering
    any detected abnormal situation. Moreover, this robot can also carry a more powerful
    computer such as Raspberry pi or industrial mini personal computers inside. Thus,
    the data are collected and processed in the same robotic system as in edge computing.

  description: Machine learning applications are having a great impact on the global
    economy by transforming the data processing method and decision making. Agriculture
    is one of the fields where the impact is significant, considering the global crisis
    for food supply. This research investigates the potential benefits of integrating
    machine learning algorithms in modern agriculture. The main focus of these algorithms
    is to help optimize crop production and reduce waste through informed decisions
    regarding planting, watering, and harvesting crops. This paper includes a discussion
    on the current state of machine learning in agriculture, highlighting key challenges
    and opportunities, and presents experimental results that demonstrate the impact
    of changing labels on the accuracy of data analysis algorithms. The findings recommend
    that by analyzing wide-ranging data collected from farms, incorporating online
    IoT sensor data that were obtained in a real-time manner, farmers can make more
    informed verdicts about factors that affect crop growth. Eventually, integrating
    these technologies can transform modern agriculture by increasing crop yields
    while minimizing waste. Fifteen different algorithms have been considered to evaluate
    the most appropriate algorithms to use in agriculture, and a new feature combination
    scheme-enhanced algorithm is presented. The results show that we can achieve a
    classification accuracy of 99.59% using the Bayes Net algorithm and 99.46% using
    Naïve Bayes Classifier and Hoeffding Tree algorithms. These results will indicate
    an increase in production rates and reduce the effective cost for the farms, leading
    to more resilient infrastructure and sustainable environments. Moreover, the findings
    we obtained in this study can also help future farmers detect diseases early,
    increase crop production efficiency, and reduce prices when the world is experiencing
    food shortages.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Machine learning applications are having a great
    impact on the global economy by transforming the data processing method and decision
    making. Agriculture is one of the fields where the impact is significant, considering
    the global crisis for food supply. This research investigates the potential benefits
    of integrating machine learning algorithms in modern agriculture. The main focus
    of these algorithms is to help optimize crop production and reduce waste through
    informed decisions regarding planting, watering, and harvesting crops. This paper
    includes a discussion on the current state of machine learning in agriculture,
    highlighting key challenges and opportunities, and presents experimental results
    that demonstrate the impact of changing labels on the accuracy of data analysis
    algorithms. The findings recommend that by analyzing wide-ranging data collected
    from farms, incorporating online IoT sensor data that were obtained in a real-time
    manner, farmers can make more informed verdicts about factors that affect crop
    growth. Eventually, integrating these technologies can transform modern agriculture
    by increasing crop yields while minimizing waste. Fifteen different algorithms
    have been considered to evaluate the most appropriate algorithms to use in agriculture,
    and a new feature combination scheme-enhanced algorithm is presented. The results
    show that we can achieve a classification accuracy of 99.59% using the Bayes Net
    algorithm and 99.46% using Naïve Bayes Classifier and Hoeffding Tree algorithms.
    These results will indicate an increase in production rates and reduce the effective
    cost for the farms, leading to more resilient infrastructure and sustainable environments.
    Moreover, the findings we obtained in this study can also help future farmers
    detect diseases early, increase crop production efficiency, and reduce prices
    when the world is experiencing food shortages. Keywords: crop prediction; machine
    learning; feature selection; artificial intelligent; smart farming 1. Introduction
    Agriculture is a vital element that has a significant role in nourishing the world’s
    growing population. To keep pace with the increasing demand for foodstuffs, farmers
    need to make the best use of them to reap output while minimizing losses. Forecasting
    and examining reap growth is a serious part of modern agriculture, and machine
    learning has become a powerful tool to achieve this goal line [1,2]. Smart farming,
    or precision agriculture, is a modern farming conduct that utilizes recent technology
    to optimize reap production and minimize waste. Smart farming aims to increase
    reap output while minimizing using resources such as water, fertilizer, and energy
    [3]. Figure 1 illustrates IoT and machine learning-based crop analysis and prediction
    processes. Over the years, numerous elements and technologies have been integrated
    into the architecture of a smart farm, such as sensing and monitoring systems,
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI),
    precision agriculture techniques, remote monitoring and control, automated systems,
    livestock management systems, cloud computing and big data storage, energy management,
    and farm management software, to enhance farming practices and boost productivity
    [4,5,6]. In smart farming, the Internet of Things is considered one of the key
    contributing technologies used. IoT sensors can be utilized to monitor soil moisture,
    temperature, and other environmental aspects [7], and the gathered data from the
    IoT sensors can be used to define the best time to plant, water, and harvest reaps.
    By using IoT sensors, farmers can guarantee that the reaps receive the right amount
    of water and nutrients, which can improve their quality and yield [8,9]. Figure
    1. IoT and machine learning-based crop analysis and prediction process. In recent
    years, machine learning applications have entered our lives in many areas, from
    health to defense industries and education to urbanization, and have taken an
    effective way in decision-making situations. At the same time, it started to produce
    information and technology solutions by forming the basis of the newly emerging
    search engine infrastructure, such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer
    from the OpenAI [10], Google Bard [11], and similar AI-based chatbots and some
    other tools). Many research companies reveal that new trends will grow even more
    in various platforms. In this respect, the effect of machine learning-oriented
    systems and solutions in the technology field will increase its effectiveness
    as a huge multiplier, and many sectors, such as chip design [12] and traffic estimations
    [13], would be changed by enforcing machine learning models. Generally, it is
    essential to collect and analyze accurate data using machine learning algorithms.
    The data collection is critical in both quality and size to obtain accurate results
    and make high predictions. In general, big data have size, speed, and various
    characteristics. Their large size helps eliminate randomness and allows the data
    to provide detailed results. In addition, large-scale analysis data could be more
    structured. Using more than one dataset from different sources in the analysis
    will provide a higher success rate. Many sources, such as sensors, social media,
    digital networks, physical devices, the stock market, and health centers, are
    sufficient data sources. This data can be accessed through APIs, web collection,
    and direct access paths. Data can be in two forms: static datasets or stream data.
    Data from different platforms are incorporated into the data processing operations.
    Analysis using these collected data makes data cleaning and preprocessing more
    critical while using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms
    can analyze vast amounts of data from IoT sensors and other sources. It is a rapidly
    growing field that has the potential to transform the way we predict and analyze
    crop growth and output. Machine learning algorithms use statistical/mathematical
    models and algorithms to analyze data and make predictions, enabling computer
    systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed
    [14]. In agriculture, especially in the cultivation area, machine learning algorithms
    can be trained on comprehensive data collected from farms, such as weather patterns,
    soil properties, crop growth stages, and pest and disease outbreaks. By evaluating
    the collected data, machine learning models can forecast reap growth, output,
    and quality with high accuracy [15]. A noteworthy application of machine learning
    in agriculture is precision farming, which includes employing data and technology
    to optimize agricultural conducts such as fertilization, irrigation, and pest
    control to improve reap output and quality. Machine learning models can examine
    bulky amounts of data from several sources, such as satellite imagery, drone footage,
    and soil sensors, to craft comprehensive maps of reap growth, nutrient levels,
    and moisture content. Farmers can utilize these maps to regulate their farming
    conducts, such as applying fertilizer or watering specific field areas, to maximize
    reap output and minimize waste [16]. Machine learning can also help farmers identify
    the most profitable crops to plant based on market demand and environmental factors.
    By analyzing historical market data and weather patterns, machine learning models
    can predict the demand for different crops and suggest optimal planting times
    and locations [17]. This can help farmers maximize their profits while minimizing
    the risk of crop failure. In addition to predicting crop growth and output, machine
    learning can also analyze the quality of the harvested crops. Machine learning
    models can analyze the color, texture, and shape of fruits and vegetables to determine
    their ripeness and quality. This information can be used to optimize the harvesting
    process and ensure that only high-quality produce is sold to consumers [18,19].
    There are several encounters for deploying machine learning in agriculture, such
    as the lack of data groundwork, high cost of sensors and other technology, and
    need for specialized proficiency to develop and maintain the different solutions.
    However, as more farms implement precision agriculture and gather data, the potential
    profits of deploying machine learning in agriculture will become more evident.
    It is worth mentioning that machine learning in agriculture is still in its early
    stages, and more research needs to be conducted in this area to realize this technology’s
    potential fully. So far, the results are promising, and machine learning will
    likely become increasingly important [20]. In this study, the authors explore
    the effects of machine learning on multiple industries and present an overview
    of the methodologies utilized in various research studies. They emphasize the
    significance of gathering and analyzing precise data by applying machine learning
    algorithms to construct models that correctly predict labels based on the input
    data. This study discusses several classification algorithms, such as Decision
    Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random
    Forest (RF), which can be employed to build such models. The authors predict that
    adopting machine learning-focused systems and solutions will significantly enhance
    efficiency and productivity, resulting in massive industry changes. This paper
    is structured as follows: First, the introduction and background reading are presented
    in Section 1 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Then, in Section
    2, a relevant literature review is presented. Section 3 introduces artificial
    intelligence in smart farming to delve deeper into the subject. Crop analysis
    and prediction- benefits and challenges are given in Section 4. Section 5 outlines
    the methodologies used in this study, followed by the presentation of the experimental
    results in Section 6. Lastly, Section 7 is dedicated to the conclusion and future
    recommendations. 2. Literature Review Machine learning approaches and algorithms
    are utilized in crop yield prediction methods to improve the quality of the crop
    so that the farmer’s profit is maximized. The quality of the agricultural sector
    is improved; hence, the overall economy is enhanced. This issue has been discussed
    in detail in the literature [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. In
    [21], a review of machine learning algorithms to predict palm oil yield is discussed.
    The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the related work, focusing on
    the suggested approaches’ advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Furthermore,
    based on the discussion and evaluation of the existing studies, the authors provided
    a new architecture based on machine learning methods to predict palm oil yield.
    The authors in [22] focused on crop prediction and yield by studying soil quality,
    considering that soil properties have a major effect on crop production. The authors
    studied different soil properties, such as NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium)
    levels, temperature, rainfall, moisture, PH value, and humidity. Comparative analyses
    concern three machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and
    Random Forest. Moreover, the authors conducted a comparison between these algorithms
    concerning accuracy. A crop production model proposed in [23] aims to manage the
    produced crop using machine learning algorithms to help farmers in developing
    countries who are still using traditional methods and cannot recognize the correct
    market value of their products. The proposed system is based on three scenarios;
    firstly, choosing the best crops based on the farmer’s location; secondly, providing
    guidance on soil preparation; and thirdly, providing the best way of crop marketing
    from farmer to consumer. The authors applied Support Vector Regression; Voting
    Regression techniques; Random Forest Regression algorithms; and proper real climate,
    weather, and soil data. Due to the scarcity of natural resources around the world,
    the authors in [24] proposed to utilize supervised machine learning algorithms,
    such as K-Nearest Neighbor Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial
    Neural Network, to help farmers make the proper decision regarding crop selection
    and production; therefore, the country’s overall economic status will be improved.
    Observing the growth process of chili and cotton crops using mobile phone images
    and machine learning techniques is the subject of the study [24]. The authors
    suggested a prediction method using the following supervised machine learning
    algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor
    (K-NN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and logistic regression (LR). The authors
    claimed that the study might help in the smart-farming process by recognizing
    the best machine learning algorithm for better crop prediction and analysis, especially
    for chili and cotton crops. In [25], a dataset for soil prediction was collected
    from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), India, which involved 32 districts.
    Based on the comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms, such
    as Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net, and Instance-Based Learner (IBK) algorithms, the authors
    claimed that the provided comparative results help farmers to make the proper
    decision regarding crop selection and production. The authors in [26] recommended
    22 types of crops in this study and proposed a three-step framework: firstly,
    data preprocessing and feature extraction; secondly, classification; and, finally,
    performance evaluation. As a result of the comparison, the authors claimed that
    the best classifier for this problem is Naïve Bayes, with an accuracy of 99.45%.
    This research work would provide a better outcome if the authors performed the
    classification and performance evaluation for a real problem. Since crop monitoring
    is considered the main domain in the smart-farming process and crop diseases are
    the main reason for yield losses, especially in developing countries, the authors
    in [27] provided a comprehensive survey on crop monitoring techniques concerning
    crop yield estimation and disease detection using deep learning models. Based
    on the results and comparison, the authors claimed that crop monitoring techniques
    using deep learning methods are more accurate and powerful than some developing
    countries’ traditional methods. In [28], the authors proposed a novel technique
    based on Support Vector Machines for auxiliary information on real applications
    of the agriculture sector. The authors claimed that they obtained an accuracy
    of 91% compared to the existing applications. The farmers can use this proposed
    methodology to gain a better yield of the crops, and different governmental sectors
    can use it to improve crop productivity. However, the authors did not suggest
    any recommendations for fertilizer systems to improve crop management. In [29],
    a machine learning and Multilayer Perception method, along with the quantity of
    rainfall, have been suggested by the authors to help farmers in making a proper
    decision regarding a harvest even before they start planting. Furthermore, the
    suggested method focuses on the optimal process for the marketing and storage
    of the crop. Based on the provided results, the authors claimed that the proposed
    method would be beneficial for farmers to improve agricultural yield outcomes.
    In [30], the main objective of this research was to predict crop productivity
    loss by utilizing linear regression methods based on data taken from the previous
    year’s statistics. The models were created using real-world data, and the evaluation
    process was based on samples. The authors applied both Naïve Bayes and Decision
    Tree algorithms in this evaluation. They claimed that the proposed method improves
    production and maximizes the farmer’s profit. In [31], the authors developed a
    web-based application for crop yield prediction to be used by farmers. This tool
    provides farmers with a list of various crops planted previously to predict and
    learn about the best crop to cultivate in the future. Furthermore, the tool can
    provide farmers with climate data and information to help them make the best decision
    regarding market demand and prices. In [32], the author’s survey’s main objective
    was to evaluate the performance of different publications from 2016 to 2020 that
    aimed to predict fungal illnesses on the crops. The authors evaluated different
    machine learning algorithms utilized in the literature. As per the provided comparative
    results, the authors concluded that the best performance among all machine learning
    models, SVM, variations of choice trees, and Naïve Bayes has been widely utilized
    and gained the best results regarding the yearly prediction of crop diseases.
    In [33], using machine learning, the authors proposed a system for the early prediction
    of crop diseases in plants by utilizing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    method. The dataset that is taken from a village is trained and tested. Different
    diseases are collected in a database, and the classifier is trained to compare
    the accuracy and choose the one with high accuracy. The provided model helps farmers
    predict plant diseases and make the best decision regarding the type of crop to
    be planted. The authors in [34] recognized problems facing farmers in India regarding
    crop yield prediction; therefore, they collected datasets published online. To
    facilitate analyzing and studying data, the dataset was clustered using the K-Means
    Clustering algorithm, and the Naïve Bayes algorithm was used to recognize the
    best crop to plant. The provided analysis and results show that the proposed system
    is beneficial for farmers, not only for the early prediction of crop yields but
    also for selecting the best crop to plan. Based on the above literature review,
    it can be noticed that this issue has been discussed in the literature from different
    perspectives. Most of the work in this field utilized machine learning algorithms
    to help farmers with crop prediction gain better yield and improve overall production.
    However, many research analyses did not consider a real problem for which to perform
    classification and performance evaluation. Further, the authors did not give clear
    notifications about the obtained accuracy. Exceptionally, in [26], the authors
    provided analysis and performance evaluation with an accuracy of 99.45%, but still
    on 22 selected crops only and not based on real data. With this paper, we aim
    to improve the performance of machine learning usage in smart farming by: Presenting
    experimental results that demonstrate the impact of changing labels on the accuracy
    of data analysis algorithms. The research outcome recommends that farmers could
    make more informed verdicts about factors that affect crop growth by analyzing
    wide-ranging data collected from farms, including real-time data from IoT sensors.
    As per the provided analysis in this research work, the machine learning algorithms
    demonstrate a high level of classification accuracy. Notably, the Bayes Net algorithm
    achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.59%, while both the Naïve Bayes Classifier
    and Hoeffding Tree algorithms yielded a remarkable accuracy of 99.46%. These results
    highlight the efficacy and reliability of these algorithms in accurately classifying
    the given data. Therefore, by integrating different technologies, the achieved
    results can be used as an indicator for the farmers to have early and informed
    decisions regarding crop prediction to improve productivity, and hence the overall
    economy will be improved, accordingly. 3. Machine Learning in Smart Farming Innovative
    farming methods have profoundly transformed agriculture using advanced technologies
    to increase productivity, enhance sustainability, and lessen environmental harm.
    Machine learning (ML), a vital component of this change, has enabled various applications
    that simplify farming operations and better inform decision-making processes.
    ML applications are widely used in livestock, water, soil, and crop management.
    ML improves animal welfare for livestock and boosts production, increasing sustainability
    via predictive modeling and real-time health monitoring [35]. ML is exploited
    to optimize irrigation and water usage for water management by analyzing various
    parameters. The application of newly emerging ML technologies and large amounts
    of available weather and water data makes it easier to manage water resources.
    This is especially helpful because natural events can be unpredictable, and the
    relationships between them can be complicated [36]. In soil management, ML helps
    analyze soil health, predict nutrient needs, and conclude the factors affecting
    soil distribution controls [37]. As in crop management, ML detects diseases and
    weeds, evaluates crop quality, recognizes species, and predicts crop yield. Crop
    yield prediction is immensely important for farmers and policymakers, governments
    concerned with food security, and food marketing organizations [38]. These stakeholders
    can use yield prediction models to make data-driven decisions and develop strategies
    for efficient resource allocation, food distribution, and price stabilization.
    This leads to a more resilient food system that can be assured by anticipating
    crop production changes. However, predicting crop production is a complex task,
    as it is affected by many factors, such as weather conditions, the kind of fertilizer
    used, soil type, and the variety of seeds. Consequently, tackling this task necessitates
    the incorporation of diverse datasets and a range of attribute types. Supervised
    learning techniques benefit crop yield prediction among the numerous ML categories.
    This is due to their robust predictive capabilities and ability to handle different
    attribute types. These methods employ labeled data to forecast outcomes based
    on specific inputs. For example, they project crop yields based on weather conditions
    and soil quality data. Forecasting crop yield can be achieved using a broad spectrum
    of ML techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector
    Machines, and Random Forests [39,40,41,42]. These algorithms’ ability to process
    historical and up-to-date information regarding weather, soil conditions, and
    crop health facilitates precise crop yield predictions. The resulting insights
    enable farmers to make educated decisions about planting, irrigation, and fertilization,
    ultimately leading to optimized yields and less resource wastage. Machine learning
    is already playing an important role in providing farmers with information to
    make agriculture more efficient and productive, hence maximizing their profits.
    Therefore, farmers are highly encouraged to apply ML algorithms and techniques
    efficiently, especially while collecting, processing, and analyzing data. ML technology
    can provide a solution to most challenges farmers face [43]. It can help them
    predict the weather more accurately, decrease waste, boost output, and increase
    profit margins. In this regard, farmers are motivated to use the advanced technology
    to collect data, such as autonomous vehicles, variable rate technology, GPS-based
    soil sampling, automated hardware, telematics, software, sensors, cameras, robots,
    drones, GPS guidance, and control systems [44]. According to [45], two-thirds
    of the farmers worldwide struggle to use technology, and more than 50% are unaware
    of the existing solutions. Teaching farmers to work with machine learning can
    be a transformative step in modernizing agriculture and improving productivity.
    While AI technology may seem daunting to some, there are ways to educate farmers
    about the benefits of smart farming and the usage of machine learning algorithms.
    Farmers need to be aware of the great benefits they may achieve if they use automation
    and AI on their farms. Training and informative workshops are the fastest ways
    to do so. This training needs to include foundation knowledge of ML, identifying
    use cases in agriculture, the importance of data collection and preparation for
    better prediction, ML algorithms and their best applications, and addressing concerns
    or misconceptions related to ethical and privacy considerations. They should be
    introduced to success stories of smart farms and encouraged to increase collaboration
    and share knowledge with their peers. A very important point is to introduce them
    to user-friendly tools and platforms that do not require programming skills for
    easy adaption. Since ML is a rapidly evolving field and new techniques and tools
    emerge frequently, we should encourage farmers to continue learning and stay updated
    with the latest developments in the field. Despite the optimistic outlook of ML
    in agriculture, similar to any ML issue, the quality of the results is predominantly
    influenced by the quality of the input data. The efficacy of crop yield prediction
    depends heavily on the quality and availability of data. Crop prediction requires
    wide-ranging data, including weather, soil, historical yield, and satellite imagery.
    Guaranteeing data quality through efficient collection, preprocessing, and feature
    selection is critical in model development. However, agricultural big data introduces
    several challenges, which will be examined in the following section. 4. Crop Analysis
    and Prediction Benefits and Challenges As stated earlier, while machine learning
    is being exploited in multiple fields, it remains an active area of research and
    a challenging one in the agricultural domain. This section summarizes the main
    benefits and challenges ML faces when used in crop analysis and predictions based
    on recent research [46,47,48,49,50]. Figure 2 shows AI-based crop analysis and
    prediction phases. Figure 2. AI-based crop analysis and prediction. 4.1. Benefits
    The following are the key advantages farmers can receive from utilizing machine
    learning on their farms: More effectiveness: This approach is more effective and
    accurate in identifying patterns and saving farmers time and resources because
    a larger volume of data can be evaluated by machine learning in a shorter amount
    of time than with previous methods. Increased crop yield: Using many data sources
    for analysis, including weather patterns, soil quality, and historical machine
    learning algorithms, can help farmers make more informed decisions that increase
    crop yields. Lower costs: Machine learning may assist farmers in maximizing the
    use of resources, such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, by offering insights
    into crop development and health. This can save expenses while lowering how much
    of an impact agriculture has on the environment. Early disease detection: Farmers
    can take preventative measures to stop the spread of illness and reduce crop loss
    by identifying early indicators of crop diseases with machine learning. Once the
    model is sufficiently trained, it can detect anomalies such as discoloration on
    growth size in the early stages of disease much faster than humans would notice.
    Improved crop management: By offering insights into variables such as soil moisture,
    temperature, and nutrient levels, ML algorithms can assist farmers in improving
    their crop management tactics. This can assist farmers in making data-driven decisions
    regarding the best time to water, fertilize, and sow their crops. Overall, using
    ML in crop analysis and prediction can help farmers optimize their crop yields,
    reduce waste, and increase profitability while promoting sustainable farming practices.
    4.2. Challenges Although crop analysis and prediction can significantly benefit
    from machine learning, there are also various challenges we need to consider.
    The main difficulties consist of the following: Data quality: The accuracy and
    dependability of machine learning models depend on the caliber of the training
    data. Obtaining high-quality data in agriculture can be challenging because of
    changes in the soil, climate, geography, and other environmental factors. As a
    result, gathering and cleansing data might be difficult. Ref. [51] discusses the
    main challenges related to fruit detection and recognition based on deep learning.
    They have concluded that most of the factors leading to low accuracy, slow speed,
    and poor robustness of fruit detection and recognition are related to the scarcity
    of high-quality fruit datasets, detection of small target fruits, fruit detection
    in occluded and dense scenarios, detection of multi-scale and multi-species fruits,
    and lightweight fruit detection models. Data volume: ML models frequently need
    a large amount of data for efficient training. Large data management and collection
    in agriculture can be complex, especially for small farms. Ref. [52] considers
    volume, velocity, variety, and veracity as the main challenges of big data. Model
    complexity: Because agricultural systems are intricate, it can be challenging
    to develop machine learning models that account entirely for all the important
    variables affecting crop development and output. Selecting the best model architecture
    for a specific crop analysis or forecast activity can be difficult and requires
    extensive knowledge [53]. Additionally, the most common use of ML techniques provides
    analysis for prediction, recommendations, situation determination, and automation.
    NN, RF, SVM, DT, and Naïve Bayes algorithms are the most popular techniques used
    in agronomy. The main challenges for these algorithms are the large volume of
    data, which increases the complexity of the training time and computation for
    SVM [53], and the need to tailor the algorithm for each specific problem in the
    case of RF [54]. The design of big data architecture is one of the most complex
    challenges, considering that it must be flexible and highly scalable [55]. Ref.
    [56] analyzed the factors affecting soil temperature and concluded that the relationship
    between variables affecting the soil temperature is quite complex and challenging,
    leading to the estimation of it using physically and statistically based models
    with a tradeoff between resolution, accuracy, and computational efficiency. According
    to them, the best ML technique for soil temperature retrieval generally depends
    on training datasets, model structure, and target level of accuracy. Other challenges
    related to the usage of ML in agriculture are: Interpretability: Analyzing the
    outcomes of ML models, particularly those that use deep learning techniques, which
    are quite complex, can be challenging. Because of this, it may be difficult for
    farmers to comprehend the elements that go into making a particular crop prediction
    or suggestion. Accessibility: In situations with limited resources, obtaining
    access to the hardware and software infrastructure required for developing and
    deploying ML models may be challenging. Privacy and security: These concerns exist
    around collecting, storing, and using sensitive agricultural data. It can be challenging
    to ensure privacy and security while still allowing access to the data for ML
    research. Human factors: It is possible that farmers and other interested parties
    need more time to be ready to adopt new methods and technology, such as ML-based
    systems. For technology to be used more widely, it must be made accessible, user-friendly,
    and capable of providing real benefits. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration
    between data scientists, farmers, and other stakeholders to ensure that ML algorithms
    are effective, usable, and ethical. 5. Methodology In our research endeavor, we
    deployed a comprehensive array of 15 diverse machine learning algorithms to construct
    models based on agricultural data, including 2200 records encompassing 22 distinct
    crop labels. These models provide farmers with recommendations on the most suitable
    crops to cultivate. Our methodology for crop analysis in Figure 3 adheres to the
    standard stages of data analysis [53,54,55,56]. A significant improvement is the
    inclusion of multiple classifiers, which are fine-tuned and evaluated to identify
    the most suitable ones for the input data. Moreover, our methodology incorporates
    feature reduction and augmentation techniques [57], essential for highlighting
    pertinent features that enhance crop detection and assist farmers in selecting
    the most appropriate features for accurate predictions. Figure 3. Methodology
    for crop prediction using IoT and ML. In our study, we proposed applying various
    machine learning algorithms with different features for crop analysis. These algorithms
    were carefully chosen based on their unique capabilities and characteristics and
    included the Naïve Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, and Multilayer Neural Network.
    We thoroughly analyzed the results, emphasizing the essential features contributing
    to high accuracy. To ensure high-quality data, we emphasize the importance of
    data collection and preprocessing, including tasks such as cleaning and transformation.
    Figure 3 provides an overview of our crop analysis and prediction of our methodology,
    incorporating IoT and machine learning algorithms. We have the following steps
    in our models for crop prediction. – Data Collection: The collection of data from
    IoT devices on farms is vital for conducting machine learning analysis. By gathering
    crucial information on crop usage, crop type, water requirements, and harvest
    methods for agriculture, we can significantly increase productivity on smart farms.
    – Data Modeling: The accuracy of data analysis was tested through experiments
    that involved altering labels. To group crops, we categorized them into four broad
    groups based on various factors, rather than predicting individual crop types.
    We analyzed a dataset of crop types using machine learning, utilizing seven different
    features to classify them. Additionally, we determined the minimum number of features
    necessary for precise learning and prediction. – Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
    We want to achieve precise crop detection by selecting appropriate features for
    our machine learning algorithms. To ensure optimal results, we considered parameter
    properties on the relevant properties. This allowed us to obtain accurate and
    reliable data for our agricultural operations. During our experiments, we analyzed
    the effects of modifying the labels on the accuracy of our data analysis algorithm.
    This enabled us to understand the impact of minor label changes better and helped
    us optimize our approach toward achieving greater accuracy in our results. To
    achieve success in crop classification, it is vital to utilize broader labels.
    It is crucial to thoroughly investigate and ascertain the most efficient classification
    techniques within this domain. Several classification algorithms, such as Naïve
    Bayes Classifiers, Random Forest, and Multilayer Neural Network, are used to build
    a model to predict the correct labels based on provided data. The constructed
    model was initially achieved by training using training data; then, the results
    were evaluated using test data to ensure that predictions were accurate and desired
    values. The following algorithms were used in our experiment: – Naïve Bayes Classifier
    is a supervised learning algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem to classify objects.
    It is used in machine learning and data mining applications for text analysis,
    medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and other similar tasks. Naïve Bayes assumes
    that features in a class are considered independent of each other. In practice,
    the Naïve Bayes algorithm performs well, especially when the data are sparse,
    and the number of features is extensive. Below is the pseudocode for Naïve Bayes
    Classifier: Input: {X: Training set; m: Number of observations; n: Number of features;
    Labels y for the training set}. Output: {New data point x to be classified; predicted
    class for x}. For each unique class value c in y, calculate the prior probability
    for class c P(c) = count(c)/m where count (c) is the count of observations with
    class c. For each feature i in X and each unique class value c in y, calculate
    the conditional probability of feature i given class c as follows: P(i|c) = (count
    (i, c))/(count(c)) where count (i, c) is the count observations with the feature
    i and class c. Calculate the posterior probability for each class given the new
    data point x: ◦ Initialize the posterior probability P(c|x) to P(c) ◦ For each
    feature i in x: =, multiply P(c|x) by P(i|c) if x[i] is observed in the training
    data, otherwise ignore the term. Choose the class with the highest posterior probability
    as the predicted class for x. – Random Forest is a type of supervised machine
    learning algorithm that is used in regression and classification problems. It
    is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses Decision Trees to make a prediction.
    Random Forest creates many Decision Trees and combines their predictions to make
    a final prediction. More trees created yield high accuracy and robust results.
    Below is the pseudocode for the Random Forest algorithm: Inputs: {(x, y): Training
    data set; T: Number of trees; d: Maximum depth of each tree; f: Number of features
    to consider at each split} Outputs: {Learned trees for classification} For each
    tree in the Random Forest: ◦ Select a bootstrap sample from the training data
    set. ◦ Create a Decision Tree T_t with a maximum depth of d. ◦ Randomly select
    f features to consider at each split of T_t. ◦ Use the selected features to find
    the best split at each node of T_t. Create the list of Decision Trees T_1, T_2,
    ..., T_T. For each input data: ◦ For each decision, find the prediction. ◦ Obtain
    predictions of all the trees. ◦ Calculate the final predicted class. – Multilayer
    Neural Network is a machine learning algorithm consisting of multiple layers of
    interconnected nodes between the input and output layers. To minimize the error
    between the predicted output and the actual output, the neural network involves
    adjusting each neuron’s weight and biases by using an optimization algorithm such
    as backpropagation. Below is the pseudocode for the Multilayer Neural Network
    algorithm: Define the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer. Initialize
    the weights and biases for each neuron in the network randomly. For each input
    data: Forward propagate the input through the neural network to obtain the predicted
    output. Calculate the error rate between the predicted output and the actual output.
    Backward propagate the error through the neural network to adjust the weights
    and biases using the optimization algorithm. Repeat until the error converges
    to a satisfactory level. By integrating these methodologies, we aimed to provide
    farmers with efficient and effective crop recommendations, ensuring they receive
    tailored advice based on the most pertinent features while minimizing the required
    effort and time investment. 6. Experimental Results In this work, we used 15 different
    machine learning algorithms to model agriculture data, which recommend to farmers
    the most suitable crops to produce on the farm. Tabular data are used in this
    work for classification of the crop data. Data are collected from the Kaggle database,
    which is an online platform for scientists to share their research data [58].
    The dataset includes several features, such as ratio of Nitrogen content (N),
    temperature, pH value of the soil, rainfall, humidity, ratio of Phosphorous content
    (K), and ratio of Potassium content (P) in the soil. The crop prediction dataset
    has 2200 records, which have 22 crop labels, such as apple, banana, rice, coffee,
    cotton, black gram, watermelon, chickpea, coconut, grapes, jute, kidney beans,
    grape, lentil, and orange. The dataset includes several features, such as the
    ratio of Nitrogen content (N), temperature, pH value of the soil, rainfall, humidity,
    ratio of Phosphorous content (K), and the ratio of Potassium content (P) in the
    soil. Sixty-seven percent of the data is used in training, and the rest of the
    data are used for testing. Table 1 shows accuracy values and error rates for the
    algorithms considered. Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Hoeffding Tree, and
    Random Forest algorithms yield the best accuracy. The DT algorithm yields 88.50%,
    and the rest of the classification algorithms have more than 90% accuracy. Error
    metrics can be formalized as follows: K (Kappa) = (Po − Pe)/(1 − Pe) (1) where
    Po is relative observed agreement and Pe is hypothetical probability of chance
    agreement. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝐼= ∑ N i=1 | y i − x i | n (2) where
    n is the total number of data, xi is the true value, and yi is the prediction.
    RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)= [ ∑ n i=1 ( x i − x ′ i )] n − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − √ (3) where xi is observed and xi′ is the predictive value. RAE (Relative
    Absolute Error)= ∑ n i=1 | y i − y ′ i | ∑ n i=1 | y i −y| (4) where y is the
    average value of the data. Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE)=A= ∑ n i=1 ( P i
    − T j ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( T i −T) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (5) where P is
    the predicted value and T is the target value. Table 1. Accuracy and error values
    for each classification algorithm. Table 2 shows each algorithm’s build and test
    time. It can be noticed that the Multilayer Perception algorithm build time is
    greater than other algorithms because this algorithm is an Artificial Neural Network
    algorithm, including several hidden layers in addition to the input and output
    layer. The MLP algorithm runs with several iterations to find the best model for
    the given input and output set, which increases the build time. KSTAR and LWL
    algorithms have higher testing times than others. The NBC algorithm is the most
    efficient algorithm in classifying crop data based on accuracy and process time.
    Table 2. Build and test times for classification algorithms. Table 3 demonstrates
    accuracy and error measurement in the Multilayer Perception algorithm with different
    sample sizes of training data. When 10% of the data is used in training, accuracy
    with MLP is 93.53%; however, when 90% of data is used, accuracy is 97.72%. In
    the MLP algorithm, reaching high accuracy and efficient time complexity is important.
    The MLP algorithm can be very efficient in numeric-based data; however, it will
    be slow if collected data are images or videos. Table 3. Accuracy and error values
    for Multilayer Perception algorithm (training set from 10% to 90%). Table 4 presents
    the build and test times for the Multilayer Perception (MLP) algorithm under different
    scenarios involving modifications to the training and testing data percentage.
    It is worth noting that the MLP algorithm has longer build times than other algorithms
    [59,60]. The results indicate that the lowest build time is observed when the
    training set is at 40%, while the highest build time occurs when the training
    set is at 10%. On the other hand, test times are consistently low across all scenarios,
    with the highest being at 0.05 when the training set is at 10%. Experiments show
    that the MLP algorithm has higher build times than the other ML algorithms, but
    testing time is very efficient. Table 4. Build and test times for Multilayer Perception
    algorithm (training set from 10% to 90%). After performing machine learning classification
    on a dataset with seven features and one label representing the crop type and
    recording the accuracies of different algorithms in Table 1, further simulations
    were conducted to determine the minimum number of features required to achieve
    high accuracy in algorithm learning and prediction. In this work, our primary
    focus is to determine the meaningfulness and correlation of the numerous features
    used for predicting crop outcomes. To achieve this, we utilized the Variance Inflation
    Factor (VIF), a statistical measure in machine learning, to assess multicollinearity
    [61]. By calculating the VIF for each variable, we gained valuable insights into
    potential correlations among predictor variables in the model. This crucial step
    allowed us to identify the best VIF values, indicating collinearity, and values
    below 10, signifying non-collinearity. As a result of this preparation, we were
    able to select the most suitable combination of features for our dataset. Table
    5 shows the results of four scenarios where we selected three to four features
    and evaluated the accuracy of crop detection for each set. The second set of features
    (Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall) achieved the highest accuracy, reaching
    97.05% with Bayes Net and 97.32% with Random Forest. In contrast, the worst prediction
    outcome occurred when using the features N, P, and K, where the best accuracy
    obtained was 68.04% with Random Forest. Table 5. Accuracy (%) for different feature
    sets. The results in Table 5 highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate
    features for achieving high accuracy in crop detection using machine learning
    algorithms. The set of features (composed of Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall)
    we identified can be used as a guide for selecting relevant features for crop
    determination in future agricultural data analysis. More experiments were conducted
    to investigate the impact of changing the label on the accuracy of the data analysis
    algorithm. The results are displayed in Table 5 Instead of predicting the specific
    crop type, we manually grouped the crops into four more general categories based
    on their growth characteristics, usage, type, water requirements, and harvest
    method, as described in Table 6. Then, we tested the accuracy of the algorithm
    to predict these new general labels one at a time. Table 6 presents a classification
    of crops based on several class labels. The table includes information on the
    growth characteristics, usage (food, feed, fiber), type, water requirements, and
    harvest method for various crops. The crops are classified based on their growth
    characteristics, such as grass, bush, and tree; their water requirements, such
    as drought tolerance, drought, and water loving; as well as their harvest method,
    which can be performed by hand or machine. For example, rice and maize are classified
    as grasses, with the type being cereal, whereas chickpeas and pigeon peas are
    classified as bushes, with the type being legumes. Table 6. Classification of
    crops based on several class labels. This experiment aims to explore whether the
    algorithm could accurately predict more general categories of crops, which could
    be helpful in situations where general characteristics of crops are investigated,
    and specific crop types are not known or easily identifiable. The experiment results
    are summarized in Table 7, where we compared the accuracies of various classification
    methods for each general category. Table 7 shows that some classification methods
    perform better in predicting general categories. For example, the IBK, KSTAR,
    and KSTAR methods achieved high accuracies for predicting all general categories
    compared to the type of the crop (first column in the table), while Bayes Net,
    Naïve Bayes Classifier, Logistic, and Multilayer Perception had low accuracies
    for all categories. The experiment demonstrates the potential usefulness of using
    more general labels in crop classification and provides insights into which classification
    methods may be most effective for this task. Table 7. Comparison of the accuracies
    (%) of various classification methods. Further research could explore the potential
    benefits of using a combination of classifications (multi-labeling) and investigate
    the potential of using more granular or specific labels that may impact the accuracy
    of classification algorithms. 7. Conclusions Our research highlighted the significance
    of incorporating machine learning algorithms and IoT sensors in modern agriculture
    to optimize reap production and reduce waste through informed decision-making.
    This study identifies the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating
    these technologies in agriculture. It presents experimental results that demonstrate
    the impact of changing labels on the accuracy of data analysis algorithms along
    with accuracy, error values, build, and test time for each classification algorithm.
    The findings suggest that analyzing wide-ranging data collected from farms, including
    real-time data from IoT sensors, can enable farmers to make more informed decisions
    about factors that affect harvest growth. Despite the challenges associated with
    deploying machine learning in agriculture, our results achieved so far are very
    promising in that machine learning approaches will become increasingly crucial
    for production predictions in agriculture in the future. In this experiment, crops
    were investigated according to general characteristics using different machine
    learning algorithms, and valuable results were obtained by making predictions
    in cases where certain crop types are unknown or cannot be easily identified.
    Our work indicated that appropriate feature selection is critical to achieve better
    accuracy in machine learning algorithms while analyzing agricultural data. Using
    the Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Precipitation features in the dataset, it achieved
    the highest accuracy, reaching 97.05% with Bayes Net and 97.32% with Random Forest.
    This research provided valuable insights into the potential benefits of these
    technologies in modern agriculture, and further research and development in this
    field could help optimize crop production, reduce waste, and improve food security
    globally. In future work, more crop data will be evaluated using GPS-based IoT
    and sensor data from different geographic regions. All these results will be analyzed
    using a machine learning algorithm. Thus, our data evaluation pool will be established.
    In addition, different species of the same plant variety will be analyzed separately,
    and it will be possible to reveal which product is the best type of product among
    the same species using different machine learning algorithms. Author Contributions

  description: This study is aimed to design shape and realization of the Internet
    of Thing (IoT) system on smart agricultural irrigation system which monitors the
    water necessity for plants in agricultural land. This system is so beneficial
    that it can help make it easier for millennial farmers in managing the irrigation
    system and easing the plants' death risk that is caused by water deficiency and
    surplus. The development of irrigation in the screen house is still conventional
    at present, where the water pump is still being operated manually by the workers.
    The irrigation system that is operated has not yet been conducted based on the
    real-time data on the field due to the constraint of wide land coverage. The land
    has not used the smart system that can control and monitor the irrigation automatically,
    so the irrigation system becomes inefficient in order to overcome the water necessity
    for plants in agricultural land. This research suggests a solution for the problem
    by developing a smart irrigation system with the IoT network, which can operate
    the irrigation process automatically based on the data sensor that is laid on
    the field. IoT system consists of layers which include the piezometer, temperature
    sensor, humidity, soil moisture sensor and output it uses the solar power system
    to operate the irrigation water pump. The system has process knowledge decision-making
    that is equipped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) which uses the algorithm's rule-based
    expert system in screen house with NodeMCU. The result shows the monitoring of
    agricultural land with server cloud by using the internet network. It can be seen
    that it can do the watering process automatically with accurate and efficient
    water usage on plants in agricultural land.

    remote sensing 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the sector that contributes
    the most to total water withdrawals in the main olive oil producing Mediterranean
    countries, with a share of about 75% of total water withdrawals on average [1].
    However, increased water demand from other sectors such as tourism and climate
    change will limit the available water resources for agriculture in the coming
    decades and affect water quantity and quality. Efficient use of irrigation water
    is a key factor in resolving water scarcity issues, but it is also important for
    optimizing crop yields. The limited availability of water increases the interest
    of growers to save water by improved irrigation scheduling, as the cost of water
    rises. Thus, accurate irrigation scheduling remains a major challenge for growers
    [2,3]. To mitigate climate-water impacts on agricultural production, proper and
    sustainable agricultural practices related to water, soil and crops should be
    adopted by growers. Especially growers in arid and semi-arid orchard environments,
    who face significant problems with water availability, water salinity due to saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers as well as occasional outbreaks of pest infestation.
    Thus, irrigation and pest/disease control require accurate management for optimizing
    crop productivity, water-use efficiency and diminishing environmental impacts
    [4]. In such environments, there is a potential to improve water-use efficiency
    through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication
    technologies, monitoring systems and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation
    scheduling [5]. Adopting irrigation management strategies to increase water-use
    efficiency such as deficit irrigation [6] or smart irrigation systems [7] requires
    several sensors to monitor soil water availability. The assessment of the water
    status of plants is usually performed with soil moisture sensors that provide
    data on the volumetric content of water in the soil [8]. Depending on their technology,
    these sensors provide an analog or digital signal and have the ability to communicate
    with recorders. In recent years, in addition to moisture sensors, smart sensors
    have been developed that simultaneously measure electrical conductivity and soil
    temperature in addition to moisture [9]. The rapid development of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) has led to the use of sensors with minimal need for wiring and
    great improvements in their installation and maintenance [10,11,12]. A wireless
    sensor network consists of several spatially distributed measurement points, called
    nodes, that communicate wirelessly with each other. The data received from each
    of them is stored in a central hub and processed for irrigation management. The
    weakness of such systems is that they use a central communication structure (gateway)
    to communicate with the end user, which can lead to the collapse of the entire
    system if this device has limited connectivity [13]. Generally, the Internet of
    Things (IoT) refers as a cluster of physical objects that are integrated with
    multiple sensors, processing capability, software and other technologies that
    facilitate communication with other devices and the cloud. IoT-based systems exchange
    data without having physical interaction with the user and suppliers through different
    modern wireless technologies and network solutions [14]. The evolution of mobile
    networks and the development of the IoT has made mobile Internet communications
    (GSM/GPRS, LTE, and NB) inexpensive. This enabled more flexibility in the deployment
    of nodes in a wireless network as each node contains a mobile communication unit.
    In this way, the topology of the network is changed from centralized to distributed,
    resulting in minimal impact on the operation of the network in the case of a single-node
    connection failure. The disadvantage of the mobile network is the increased energy
    requirements for the transmission of the signals from the nodes, so careful planning
    should be adopted to ensure the lowest possible energy consumption [15]. The use
    of sophisticated soil moisture and environmental sensors combined with appropriate
    recorders allows the application of algorithms to automatically estimate the amount
    of water needed and apply it at the right time [16]. They also enable agricultural
    alerts to be automatically sent when weather conditions favor the development
    of diseases or pests, so that farmers can take appropriate protective measures.
    As we move towards enhancing decision-making to support farmers and growers, the
    analysis of sensor data and exploiting intelligent scheduling of processes within
    a unified platform and framework is crucial [17,18]. Today, a large number of
    companies offering platforms for sensor data visualization are available in the
    market [19,20,21,22]. However, they require skilled farmers who know how to interpret
    the data and implement the appropriate management strategy. Most of these platforms
    are basically commercial and often have high costs, which prevents the farmer
    from adopting them [23]. Previous researchers developed open IoT platforms for
    agriculture [24,25] but none of them combines scalability, multi-tenancy, cartographic
    background environment and creation of alerts when the value of a measurement
    passes a predetermined threshold. The novelty of this work is that it combines
    a decision support system for irrigation and plant protection with the above features
    connected with energy efficient low-cost end devices. Within this context, this
    work presents the design and implementation of a decision support system (DSS)
    through a low-cost IoT-based platform that provides irrigation management and
    plant protection advice to Mediterranean olive farmers. For this purpose, a network
    of reliable sensors was created to measure important soil and climate parameters
    in the areas of interest. Sensor data being stored in a database of an open-source
    IoT platform installed on the premises. Irrigation dose is estimated through a
    real-time computation, based on soil information, while weather information assists
    decision-making regarding plant protection. The proposed platform, through its
    capabilities, can effectively support the use of irrigation water towards increasing
    water productivity (ratio between the actual yield of the crop and the total water
    involved in crop production). In addition, based on the olive fly alerts provided
    by the platform, the user can act at the right time to minimize the risk of pest
    infestation that could affect production and reduce environmental impact through
    the correct use of pesticides. This manuscript is organized into the following
    two major sections. The section “Materials and methods”, which includes information
    about the study area, the IoT platform, the irrigation model and the irrigation
    strategies–olive fruit fly alarm rules. The section “Implementation and discussion”,
    which includes information about the device implementation (IoT-based monitoring
    system), the user interface-scheduled alarms for irrigation/pest control and benefits
    of the proposed system as well as steps for further improvements. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area In this study, an IoT platform system supporting optimal
    irrigation and decision-making approaches in olive growing regions was developed
    in two nearby pilot areas at the eastern part of the Island of Crete, as part
    of the AgriCapture CO2 HORIZON project. The first area is located on the coastal
    side and the other on the inland side (Figure 1). In general, in the study areas,
    more than 82% of the total water used is consumed for irrigation purposes, while
    over 92% of the total water supply comes from groundwater [26]. Considering that
    the agricultural sector is the primary consumer of water in Crete and the study
    areas face the most acute issues with water availability and saltwater intrusion,
    developing an easy-to-use and low-cost smart irrigation and decision-making system
    for ensuring water-use efficiency is a great task. Figure 1. Spatial distribution
    of the study areas, the soil sensors (S 1–S 8) as well as the meteorological stations
    (M1 and M2). Since olives are the dominant crop in the eastern part of Crete,
    and thus in both studied areas, four experimental drip irrigated olive groves
    were selected for each area to develop the proposed smart irrigation and decision-making
    system (Figure 1). These experimental sites were selected based on different criteria
    such as (a) soil and geomorphological characteristics, (b) climatic conditions,
    (c) water availability, (d) the existence of water salinity due to saltwater intrusion,
    (e) the agricultural practices already applied in the parcels and (f) the small
    size of each experimental parcel (area of about 0.2 ha) to ensure, within the
    same parcel, the lowest possible variability of the soil or/and geomorphology
    characteristics. The aim of this selection was to capture the typical range of
    olive grove characteristics in eastern Crete, including the heterogeneity of climate,
    soil, topography and cropping systems. In January 2021 a sampling campaign took
    place at the 8 studied parcels. The soil samples were collected from a representative
    olive grove soil depth of 20–40 cm and analyzed in the laboratory. Table 1 describes
    the main soil properties as well as the climatological/geomorphological conditions
    of the 8 experimental parcels. Table 1. The main soil properties and climatological/geomorphological
    conditions of the 8 experimental parcels. Based on this table, 4 out of the 8
    experimental parcels are classified in the medium texture class, 2 are classified
    in the medium–fine soil texture class, and the remaining 2 experimental parcels
    are classified in the coarse texture class. Additionally, values of organic matter,
    bulk density, rocks, and Ca+2 percentages as well as values of pH are noted in
    Table 1. In the coastal area the soil is alkaline with a higher percentage of
    carbonates. Regarding the inland studied area, the majority of the soil is considered
    light alkaline with a minimal presence of carbonates. Also noted on Table 1, the
    percentage of rocks at the experimental parcels has an extensive range between
    3.31 and 32.52%. All these values correspond to the typical values of soil where
    the eastern Cretan olive groves are located [4]. Considering the climate conditions,
    one weather station was installed in each area covering and monitoring all the
    different climatological conditions between the coastal and inland sites (Figure
    1). Generally, the olive parcels located in both areas are characterized by mild
    winters and dry summers with mean daily temperatures around 19.4 °C for the coastal
    area and 18.1 °C for the inland area, while the mean annual precipitation is around
    435.6 in the coastal area and 680.2 mm in the inland area (Table 1). Additionally,
    of high importance is that the parcels (A, B, C and D) located on the coastal
    studied area face the problem of saline water as an effect of seawater intrusion
    in the coastal aquifers, which leads to the decrease in the available freshwater
    storage volume and the simultaneous pollution of extracted irrigation wells. Table
    1 depicts the levels of ECw in the irrigation water. Thus, in these sites a proper
    saltwater irrigation management plan based on soil electrical conductivity monitoring
    levels is also proposed within the context of the developed IoT platform. For
    all the studied parcels “traditional” cultivation practices are used as a common
    production system in eastern Crete. Specifically, in all the selected farms (Figure
    1), regenerative agriculture practices such as no-tillage, suitable pruning, proper
    weed management (weed mowing) and appropriate plant protection are applied. In
    all parcels, the olive trees were of the same variety (the dominant variety in
    Crete, named Koroneiki) and about 40 years old. The same drip irrigation system
    was applied in all olive groves using local irrigation networks supplied from
    groundwater sources. The dripper flow was 8 L per hour while drip spacing was
    1 m. For all the studied parcels, one irrigation line was placed per tree row.
    The irrigation line is located about 75 cm from the tree row. Additionally, soil
    sensors, one per parcel (Sensor node 1 to 8, Table 1), were strategically installed
    between drippers and one meter away from the trunk of a representative olive tree
    of the studied parcel for capturing the dynamics of soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity and soil temperature within the parcel. 2.2. IoT platform 2.2.1.
    General Architecture The system architecture is divided into three layers that
    are independent of each other (Figure 2). The layers are interconnected through
    the Internet or local area network and interface with each other through a set
    of APIs. An essential component of the platform is the Mosquitto broker, which
    is responsible for connecting the different services through messaging. The Node-RED
    programming tool was used to connect online services. Figure 2. Platform Architecture.
    2.2.2. Layer 1 (IoT Devices) The first level consisted of energy-efficient smart
    devices to which sensors were connected for soil measurement as well as weather
    stations for obtaining climate parameters. The smart devices were installed at
    scattered locations in the plots and communicated with layer 2 through the global
    system for mobile (GSM). To measure the different agronomic parameters affecting
    irrigation, the SDI-12 (Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud) protocol was used
    [27]. It is also possible to connect other types of sensors that support different
    protocols such as I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
    as well as analog sensors. A weather station (Davis Weather Station, Wireless
    Vantage Pro2™—Davis Instruments Corporation, 3465 Diablo Ave, Hayward, CA 94545,
    USA) was installed in each study area. The exact location for the installation
    of WS was selected based on proximity to the study area and Internet access availability.
    Data from the stations is sent to a host computer using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
    The smart devices were programmed using the Arduino IDE development environment.
    The main component of each device is an ESP32 microcontroller board which is responsible
    for receiving data from the sensors at regular intervals and sending them to layer
    2 via mobile telephony. More specifically, each device consists of: An ESP32-based
    development board (DEVKIT V1). Four parallel connected 2600 mAh, 3.7 V, rechargeable
    18,650 lithium-ion batteries, which are charged by a 3.5 Watt/6 V solar panel.
    A charging module with step up boost converter (3.7 V/9 V/5 V—2 A) controls the
    battery charge and supplies the microcontroller and SDI sensor with 5 V/2 A power.
    A power switch using a logic level Mosfet for cutting off the power supply to
    the SDI-12 sensor during the sleep period. A voltage divider for measuring the
    battery level by ESP32. A SIM800L GPRS module equipped with a sim card (1nce IoT)
    which is controlled by the microcontroller unit and supplied with power from 3.7
    V lithium batteries. This module establishes communication with the mobile network
    by means of a GSM/GPRS protocol, sending the data to layer 2. A 171 × 121 × 55
    mm project box (G313MF, GAINTA). The wiring of the boards is shown in the diagram
    below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Device Schematic. 2.2.3. Layer 2 (IoT Backend) Information
    from the sensors connected to the devices is periodically sent to the Eclipse
    Mosquitto message broker that implements the MQTT protocol, establishing a TCP
    communication through the GSM/GPRS module. Files with data from the Davis weather
    stations are sent periodically to an FTP server using an Internet connection available
    near the location of the stations and are finally stored in a relational database
    using a periodically executed shell script. Data from the sensor node and weather
    stations are transferred to the Things Board IoT platform using the Node-RED programming
    tool. The Things Board community edition IoT platform uses the PostgreSQL database
    for storing data (Figure 2, Layer 2). The components of the backend include a
    virtual machine which is running the following open-source software: Ubuntu server
    (a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed and engineered to run on servers);
    MySQL relational database system; Eclipse Mosquitto™ MQTT broker; Node-RED, a
    visual programming tool that allows you to connect different web services and
    devices; Things Board community edition, an open-source IoT platform for data
    collection, processing, visualization and device management. 2.2.4. Layer 3 (Things
    Board frontend) The last level includes web design and development technologies
    (Dashboards) that allow the user to interact with the backend. The Things Board
    frontend consists of a user interface that displays information and facilitates
    interaction between the user and the platform. The frontend is structured in customers,
    assets, devices and dashboards. Each customer can own one or more assets, devices
    and dashboards. There are different entities for districts, olive plots (parcels)
    and devices which can be private or public depending on their data use (Figure
    4). Each customer (farmer) can have one or more parcels in the same or different
    areas. Meteorological data are collected based on the corresponding weather station
    located in each studied area (coastal and inland region). For each parcel entity
    there is information on agronomic factors such as soil type, plant density, area,
    tree age and irrigation system. Farm owners (customers in the platform) can manage
    the entities they have created and add or delete other users who will have access
    to the same entities. Figure 4. Structure of entities. In order to visualize the
    data from the devices, different dashboards have been created for each parcel
    with olive trees, which are visible to the farmer who owns the parcel. 2.3. Irrigation
    Model Irrigation needs per tree of each parcel were determined based on the meteorological
    data (recorded by the nearby weather station) using the Penman equation (FAO56
    version). In addition, as a parallel and more accurate process, the soil moisture
    data were used to confirm or reduce/postpone the need for the applied irrigation
    dose per tree proposed by the Penman equation. Specifically, the irrigation model
    is responsible for calculating the weekly amount of water that olive trees need
    to reach the desired soil moisture level. It can be used for any irrigation method,
    but in this case, it concerns drip irrigation as it is the dominant irrigation
    method for the specific areas. Specifically, each node (soil sensor) every week
    automatically calculates the amount of water needed to reach the desired soil
    moisture level for the corresponding studied parcel, in turn the system sends
    a mail alarm notification to the farmer to irrigate. A schematical representation
    of the different components of the incorporated IoT platform irrigation model
    is depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5. A flow chart of the incorporated irrigation
    model. To effectively incorporate soil moisture data into the proposed irrigation
    model, the estimation of the van Genuchten water retention curve is a task of
    high importance. A common addressed scientific practice to predict soil hydraulic
    parameters (unsaturated soils) is the use of the Rosetta pedotransfer model. This
    model allows the estimation of van Genuchten water retention parameters using
    limited input data such as the soil texture [28]. Nevertheless, for more robust
    and accurate results, it is highly suggested to measure and test all the hydraulic
    soil parameters through laboratory analysis [29]. Thus, using the soil hydraulic
    parameters calculated by Rosetta or by laboratory analysis, the van Genuchten
    equation can be used to determine the soil water retention curve [30,31]: 𝜃(ℎ)=
    𝜃 𝑟 + 𝜃 𝑠 − 𝜃 𝑟 [1+ (𝛼ℎ) 𝑛 ] (𝑚) where θ(h) is the soil water content (L3L−3)
    at a matric potential h, θs is the saturated water content (L3L−3), θr is the
    residual water content (L3L−3), α is related to the inverse of the air entry suction
    (L−1) and m and n are empirical parameters determining the shape of the soil water
    retention curve where m = 1 − 1/n. In turn, with the calculated water retention
    curve, the total available soil water (TAW) can be assessed as the difference
    between the volumetric soil water content of filed capacity (FC) and permanent
    wilting point (PWP) multiplied by the effective root depth. The FC and the PWP
    were estimated according to the Saxton equation [32]. Moreover, another important
    term is the fraction of TAW that a crop can extract from the root zone without
    suffering water stress, named as readily available soil water (RAW). Considering
    that irrigated olive trees have a relatively shallow root system, it is essential
    to apply water at the effective root zone, reducing the deep percolation. Depending
    on the soil type, the olive grove’s effective root zone is usually up to 30 cm
    in soil depth [33]. At that depth, there is a minimum threshold of critical matric
    potential, the lower limit of the readily available water (RAWLLim), which needs
    to be maintained. The typical threshold for olive trees ranges from—30 to −100
    kpa depending on the phenological stage [34,35]. Another benefit of the proposed
    irrigation model is that it issues differentiated recommendations for saline water
    irrigation. For olive cultivation, irrigation water is considered to be of low
    quality when the ECw is greater than 3 dS/m. The main negative effects of irrigation
    with saline water are (a) clogging of drippers, (b) making the soil water osmotic
    potential more negative so that the roots cannot absorb water efficiently, (c)
    causing root and plant toxicity, as well as (d) destruction of the soil structure
    (reduction of soil water holding capacity). In cases when there is not enough
    rainfall during consecutive years, salts will gradually accumulate from year to
    year leading to the destruction of soil texture and desertification [36,37,38].
    According to [39] the olive yield is reduced by about 10% when the electrical
    conductivity of the soil saturation extract (ECe) ranges from 4 to6 dS/m. The
    authors of [40] proposed a mathematical approach which correlates the ECe and
    the soil electrical conductivity (ECa) with various soil properties. Thus, based
    on this approach, the ECe threshold of 4–6 dS/m for olive trees was converted
    to the corresponding threshold values of ECa in our study parcels. These ECa values
    were estimated to be within 5–7 dS/m. Considering the above, when the ECa, at
    a soil depth of 30 cm, is greater than 5 dS/m, the proposed IoT system recommends
    the use of irrigation water only at critical stages of olive growing. Thus, 1–2
    irrigations are recommended before and after flowering—during spring (the irrigation
    water quality is usually better)—so that flowering, fruit set and shoot growth
    are promoted. In addition, drip irrigation is recommended to be applied at less
    frequent intervals using a higher dosage of water each time, so that salts from
    the previous irrigation events are removed to the boundaries of the wetted soil
    and consequently the main volume of water in the soil remains close to the ECw
    values [41,42]. 2.4. Irrigation Strategies and Olive Fruit Fly Alarm Rules Based
    on the proposed system and in cases of dry periods or low water availability,
    a deficit irrigation strategy could be applied (irrigation only at critical periods
    of plant growth). Thus, the crucial parameters that are incorporated for determining
    the amount of irrigation for each parcel and defining the proper irrigation strategy
    are the climatic conditions, the soil parameters/soil moisture dynamics as well
    as crop parameters, phenological stages and the water availability for each parcel.
    In addition, the system may send notifications to users when weather conditions
    favor the development of an increased population of the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera
    oleae), a key pest for olive groves of Crete. Alerts are triggered based on data
    from weather stations. The model followed trigger alerts when daytime air temperature
    was between 15 °C and 26 °C and air relative humidity was > 65% for three consecutive
    days. Alerts were deactivated when, even for one day, the air temperature during
    the daytime increased above 32 °C with a simultaneous drop in air relative humidity
    below 65% [43,44]. 3. Implementation and Discussion 3.1. Device Implementation
    (IoT-Based Monitoring System) The prototype service described in the previous
    sections was deployed in eight plots in two regions. Specifically, during 2021
    and 2022, the proposed IoT-based monitoring system for obtaining soil moisture
    and meteorological data useful in irrigation management was developed. The system
    includes the monitoring of soil moisture and atmospheric sensors, with the aim
    of providing information to farmers for decision-making. The climate conditions
    of the two studied areas were obtained by two weather stations (M1 and M2); one
    located in each area. These stations could adequately capture the meteorological
    conditions in the study areas. Both provided the IoT platform with real-time meteorological
    parameters (rainfall, max-min-average temperature, solar radiation, wind speed
    and direction, air humidity, and ET, with a time interval of 10 min), informing
    and supporting an effective irrigation schedule and pest control warning system
    for the farmers ensuring water saving as well as olive productivity. A node with
    a smart soil sensor was installed in each plot of olive trees to take measurements
    of soil moisture, electrical conductivity and temperature in real time placed
    at a soil depth of 30 cm. Maintaining water content in the soil at a constant
    level indicates that irrigation is applied at the rate of water intake from the
    crop. As mentioned above, experiments have found that a representative depth to
    monitor soil moisture for mature olive trees is at 30 cm [26]. Thus, the soil
    moisture sensors were installed at 30 cm soil depth for each irrigated olive grove.
    In the literature there are studies that propose the installation of soil moisture
    sensors at more than one soil depth. This approach has some pros (such as better
    monitoring of the soil profile) but also several cons, such as cost, risks of
    damage during fieldwork, the practical management and the inherent complexity
    of integrating data from different soil depths into a final and clear suggestion/decision
    for the user [26,45]. Additionally, for some crops such as olives, which have
    a relatively shallow root system and the effective root zone is usually up to
    30 cm soil depth, the selection of a representative soil depth for monitoring
    purposes could be considered sufficient [30]. It should be noted that the functionality
    of soil moisture data loggers in the field have already been validated and customised
    to the farmer’s needs. Detailed information about the sensor types, main characteristics
    (Table 2) and the coordinates of the sensors installed as well as photographic
    material are given below. Table 2. Main characteristics of TEROS 12 digital sensor.
    The TEROS 12 sensor by METER Group, Inc. USA, determines volumetric water content
    (VWC) using capacitance/frequency-domain technology. The sensor uses a 70 MHz
    frequency, which minimizes textural and salinity effects, making the TEROS 12
    accurate in most mineral soils. Additionally, it includes a thermistor in the
    center needle to measure temperature and electrical conductivity using a stainless-steel
    electrode array [46]. The coordinates of the sensors installed in the olive groves
    are as follows: Node1 (Sensor 1)  teros12  35°17′31.0″ N 25°30′18.9″ E Node2 (Sensor

    8)  teros12  35°14′15.1″ N 25°37′30.8″ E Data were collected, transferred and
    analyzed based on the following steps: First, data acquisition was conducted through
    smart sensors connected to a microcontroller. In turn, signals were transmitted
    over the mobile network using the MQTT protocol. Data were received at a portal
    and made available on the cloud where they could be monitored in real-time through
    an open-source IoT platform. Analyzing the data through the irrigation model,
    an e-mail notification could also be sent to the farmer when soil moisture was
    lower than a threshold value specific to the soil type. The platform informed
    the farmers of the volume of irrigation water requirements of their crops in order
    to restore soil moisture to a predefined optimal level. Corresponding information
    was also provided when the weather conditions were favorable for an outbreak (significant
    increase) of olive fruit fly population. Farmers could access the online platform
    through relevant apps for the PC, or android smart phone. During the non-irrigation
    period, the data were received from the sensors every 6 h (conserving energy used
    by the system), while during the irrigation period the data were received every
    2 h. Figure 6 depicts the installation of the node with smart soil sensors. Figure
    6. Installation of the soil moisture sensors as well as the IoT enabled device
    in the field. The reliability of the IoT-based monitoring system has been tested
    throughout the full operational use of it, during both the winter period (2021–2022)
    as well as during the irrigation season of 2022 (April to October). The IoT-based
    monitoring system integrates real-time soil moisture data from the soil sensors,
    and meteorological stations could be used as a support service tool offering an
    efficient irrigation and pest control service. 3.2. User Interface and Scheduled
    Alarms for Irrigation and Pest Control The user in the environment of this system
    can see the network of sensors located on specific farms and in turn can select
    a specific sensor/node, and they can see the plots straight away as depicted in
    Figure 7. Specifically, the owners of each farm have access to a number of dashboards
    corresponding to the farm’s plots as well as a public dashboard where the data,
    from the weather station of the area in which the farm is located, are displayed.
    Additionally, at the same dashboard, plant protection alarms based on the data
    from the weather stations are available. Analytically, the dashboards corresponding
    to the olive plots of the farm show data from the node located in the specific
    plot and include: Figure 7. The public dashboard depicts soil moisture (VWC),
    electrical conductivity (ECa), soil temperature (°C) and irrigation needs/alarms
    (upper part). On the lower part of this figure, the basic weather data, as well
    as olive fruit fly alarms are displayed. The latest telemetry for soil volumetric
    water content, electrical conductivity and temperature; Historical elements of
    the data from the node located in the specific plot; The characteristics of the
    plot (soil type, irrigation system, area, tree density and tree age); The boundaries
    of the plot on a map with a satellite background; A table with the irrigation
    alarms; The lowest soil moisture threshold value with the option to be modified
    by the user; The recommended amount of irrigation water per tree at a given moment.
    Summarizing the above information, in the case where soil moisture is below specific
    thresholds, an alarm message is sent to the farmer to inform them about the need
    of irrigation and the specific dosage that could be applied per tree. Additionally,
    the farmers have a full monitoring view of the climate conditions of their farm
    and based on this, in cases of favorable climate conditions for the olive fruit
    fly, an alarm message is also sent to inform the farmer that they should take
    action. Of course, for all of these instances, the farmer can fully control the
    needs of their parcels through their smart phone (Figure 8). Figure 8. IoT-based
    platform screenshot from mobile phone. 3.3. Benefits of the Proposed System—Steps
    for Further Improvements Considering that Mediterranean islands such as Crete
    include significant rural and touristic areas, water strategy approaches based
    on smart technological tools may ensure the balanced development between cultivated
    and touristic activities, especially on islands suffering from water shortage.
    The proposed easy-to-use IoT system can offer farmers and local authorities the
    ability to support proper irrigation and pest control management at the parcel
    scale. It is also of high importance to note that the proposed system is a low-cost
    IoT solution as it is based on an open-source software and the hardware on edge
    devices consists of widespread economical modules. The recommendations for farmers
    proposed by this system can contribute to achieving increased water-use efficiency.
    Based on the soil properties data and the climatic data of a parcel/region, the
    IoT platform could assist the user to identify the appropriate irrigation dose.
    The achievements of this IoT system can be summarized to the following points:
    (a) the reduction of irrigation water losses by implementing modern and accurate
    irrigation techniques, both for areas with high concentrations of salts in irrigation
    water and for non-saltwater affected areas; (b) the optimization of irrigation
    based on soil properties, crop type, phenological stage as well as climatic conditions;
    (c) the recommendation of a deficit irrigation strategy which can enhance irrigation
    efficiency, especially in areas with limited water availability, giving water
    only during drought-sensitive crop stages; and (d) supporting alarms for pest
    control using climate parameters, an extra useful service to the farmers, ensuring
    their crop productivity. These decision-making alarms are of high importance considering
    the more frequent insect outbreaks as an effect of changing weather conditions,
    especially in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. To ensure the functionality and trustworthiness
    of the proposed IoT system, the eight selected parcels in eastern Crete capture
    a wide range of olive, Mediterranean agro-ecosystems including the heterogeneity
    of climatic, soil, topography and cropping systems. Moreover, for each studied
    parcel the recommended weekly irrigation dose as well as the alarms for pest control
    were compared with the corresponding, manually calculated irrigation values (obtained
    by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation) and fruit fly alarms (obtained by the
    rules of favoring weather conditions), respectively. The above comparison was
    accomplished during the irrigation period of 2022. These comparisons indicate
    that the irrigation dose as well as the alarms for pest control proposed by the
    IoT system and the manual approaches for all the studied parcels was entirely
    the same. The above confirms the reliability of the outputs recommended by the
    IoT system. The limitations of the proposed IoT system as well as actions for
    further improvements can be considered in the following points. So far, preliminary
    user testing has been complemented by the team of the project as well as a few
    farmers that had practical familiarity with the proposed IoT system during project
    dissemination actions. The feedback concerning the usability of the system that
    was obtained by these actions was fairly satisfactory. Nevertheless, for further
    improvement of user interaction and platform usability, a systematic user test
    should be conducted. In addition, as future steps, the proposed decision-making
    IoT system must expand its application to additional cropping systems including
    (a) more crop types of the island (for local use), or even crops from other Mediterranean
    countries, (b) different irrigation methods and agricultural practices, (c) different
    soil types, as well as (d) different climate zones and modelling for more pest/disease
    outbreaks. Finally, it should be noted that during the following irrigation period
    another capability of this monitoring IoT system to automatically regulate irrigation
    (by controlling electric valves of the irrigation system) based on soil moisture
    levels will be tested and incorporated; a fact that can further improve the efficiency
    of irrigation and save time and effort for the farmer. 4. Conclusions The Mediterranean
    is considered a climate change hotspot. Many Mediterranean areas face or will
    face the heat of climate change more than other places in Europe, with the largest
    increase in temperature and reduction in rainfall. Mediterranean agriculture,
    including olive cultivation, has to adapt to new challenges that affect local
    water, energy and ecosystems. On the island of Crete in Greece, agriculture is
    already the largest user of water. The aim of this paper is to propose an advanced
    and easy-to-use technological system as an extra component of an already applied
    regenerative agriculture approach to cultivating olives, protecting production
    and ensuring efficient use of water. Specifically, this paper introduces a low-cost
    IoT monitoring system that has been tested in all the different olive cultivation
    characteristics in the extended area of eastern Crete for proper irrigation and
    pest control management at parcel scale. The proposed system provides useful information
    in areas that face issues with water availability, saltwater intrusion and pest
    infestation. The Implementation of the IoT-based monitoring system took place
    at eight parcels in the eastern part of Crete, where, through the proposed system,
    smart irrigation and pest control alert approaches for every parcel were offered
    to the farmers. The proposed system includes state-of-the-art technologies incorporating
    soil and atmospheric monitoring sensors and microcontrollers for transmitting
    information using the MQTT protocol. Data are received at a portal and made accessible
    on the cloud where they can be observed in real-time over an open-source IoT system
    offering the farmers services concerning proper irrigation and pest control. The
    advanced open access decision-making system implemented in olive parcels offers
    users the capability: (a) to know the weekly irrigation dose per tree at the studied
    parcel, (b) to know the proper irrigation needs in case of applied saline irrigation,
    (c) to suggest deficit irrigation in areas with low water availability as an adaptation
    strategy measure to climate change, (d) to send alarm messages to the farmers
    concerning the danger of pest infestation aiming at protecting production, and
    (e) to install an affordable field monitoring system as it is based on an open-source
    software and the hardware consists of widespread economic modules. The above capabilities
    offered by the proposed easy-to-use IoT system can increase farmers’ and policy
    makers’ awareness of optimal irrigation and pest control management issues critical
    to crop sustainability. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.N.K.; methodology,

    sensing; proximal sensing 1. Introduction Wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) is one
    of the most important crops and the essential source of calories and protein in
    the world [1]. Global wheat production averages 750 million tons per year [2]
    and was harvested from more than 218.5 million hectares in 2017. It is the largest
    cultivated area in the world [3]. Its importance for human nutrition and animal
    feed consumption makes it a critical factor for food security [1,2]. Food security
    depends on agricultural production providing the world’s growing population with
    certain food that satisfies a growing number of consumers and has a composition
    that supports a healthy human population [4]. The stability of entire food systems
    may be threatened by climate change due to short-term fluctuations in supply [4,5].
    However, at the regional scale, the potential impacts are less clear, but it is
    likely that climate change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently
    at risk of hunger and malnutrition [5]. In addition to climate change issues,
    we are currently experiencing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a major wheat producer
    (accounting for about 12% of global wheat exports [6]). This has implications
    for agriculture and the food supply chain, especially for countries dependent
    on key food commodities such as wheat, sunflower oil, and corn. Food and fuel
    prices have also increased, as have the prices of agricultural inputs such as
    fertilizer [7], which can have immense consequences for crop yields and food security
    in general. Modern scientific research and agricultural science focus on climate
    change in terms of increases in global temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide
    (CO2) concentrations, heat waves, floods, storms, droughts, and other extreme
    weather conditions [5,8]. Therefore, the above abiotic factors are receiving more
    attention in agricultural science because they negatively affect the development,
    morphological, cellular, and molecular processes of crops [8] and cause environmental
    stress that leads to yield losses of more than 50% on average for most crops [9].
    Therefore, due to their long life span, crops are highly vulnerable to climate
    change, which makes it difficult for them to adapt to changing environmental conditions
    [10]. Predicted temperature changes over the next 40 to 70 years are expected
    to be in the range of 2–3 °C in different regions [11]. The intensity and duration
    of warming trends and heat wave events are projected to become more extreme in
    the future [11]. The climate changes exacerbate environmental stress in many crops,
    including wheat. A study by Warrick [12] for Western Europe, the United Kingdom,
    and the United States on the effects of global warming on wheat productivity shows
    catastrophic effects in terms of yield loss as higher temperatures accelerate
    the evapotranspiration process and cause drought stress. Recent analyses of cereal
    productivity in Europe confirm stagnation in yields due to the effects of climate
    change compared with the 1990s [13,14]. The temperature is the most important
    environmental variable affecting the growth and development, and thus the ultimate
    productivity, of agricultural grain crops [13]. Not only is a general increase
    in temperature expected, but short periods of extreme heat are also expected to
    occur more frequently, exacerbating heat stress in plants [15]. Precipitation
    patterns can be predicted with less certainty than temperature, although it is
    likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation (i.e., the proportion of heavy
    precipitation to total precipitation) will increase in many regions, leading to
    runoff and thus reducing water availability to crops [16]. At the same time, the
    frequency of drought stress is likely to increase in many regions. The combination
    of heat and drought stress is generally more damaging than any single stress [16,17].
    Freshwater shortages are becoming a limiting factor for wheat production in many
    parts of the world [18], forcing farmers to use saline water for irrigation, which,
    combined with high soil salinity, can lead to salinity stress in wheat [19]. Climate
    change affects crop production mainly through abiotic stress factors but also
    by improving conditions for the development of biotic stress factors: diseases,
    weeds, and pests [20]. Changing climatic conditions are known to affect the occurrence,
    prevalence, and severity of plant diseases, playing a role in 44% of new disease
    emergence due to altered distribution and population size of plant pathogens [21].
    The higher mean winter temperatures and decrease in number of frost days observed
    in many parts of the world, the shift in precipitation patterns, and the trend
    toward heavier rainfall favor infection by various pathogen species responsible
    for the increase in plant diseases [21]. Given the importance of temperature on
    the population dynamics of insect pests, global warming is expected to favor the
    expansion of their geographic range, increase the proportion of overwintering
    individuals, increase the number of generations, increase the risk of introducing
    invasive pests and vector-borne plant diseases, and alter interactions with host
    plants and natural enemies [20]. This leads to more crop damage and yield loss
    [20]. Climate change favors the emergence of weeds and the introduction of non-native
    species, which has significant ecological and agronomic implications [22]. If
    the incidence of insect pest, disease, and weed populations increases as a result
    of the climate change, this could lead to more frequent use of plant protection
    products [23]. Regarding the European Green Deal [24], whose main objective is
    to reduce the use of pesticides by 50% and the use of fertilizers by 20%, and
    the problem of non-existent irrigation systems in most wheat-producing European
    countries, the only solution is digital and precise agriculture [16]. It is necessary
    to monitor the occurrence of environmental stress in plants to detect it at an
    early stage so that timely and precise agricultural measures such as fertilization,
    irrigation, and pest management can be implemented. Remote and proximal sensing
    techniques can be used to identify hot spots in fields with stressed plants and
    focus interventions on that specific area. The objective of this review was to
    understand the main physiological responses of winter wheat to environmental stress
    factors and to show how the combination of remote and proximal sensing techniques
    can help in the detection and evaluation of stress factors in winter wheat. Based
    on these techniques and data analysis using vegetation indices, chemometrics,
    and various machine learning techniques, decision-making processes in precision
    agriculture can be supported. 2. Physiological Response of Winter Wheat to Abiotic
    Stress Factors Plants are very often exposed to stressful conditions, whether
    in nature or in agricultural production. Stress can occur within minutes (e.g.,
    frost or heat) or over a period of several days, weeks (e.g., drought stress or
    waterlogging), or even months (e.g., nutrient deficiency or the presence of substances
    in toxic concentrations (e.g., salinity stress) [25,26]. Environmental stress
    factors severely limit agricultural production worldwide, cause large yield losses,
    and largely determine the distribution of certain plant species. Therefore, knowledge
    of the physiological mechanisms that occur under the influence of stress is crucial
    for agricultural production [25]. At the whole plant level, all abiotic stress
    factors trigger physiological and molecular conditions that in some cases lead
    to similar responses. Drought, salinity, and low-temperature stress can all be
    represented as physiological desiccation at the cellular level [26,27] (Figure
    1). Wheat is subjected to a range of climatic and seasonal variations in the different
    phenophases, but it appears that stress has a more detrimental effect in the reproductive
    phenophases than in the vegetative [28]. The effects of stress on reproductive
    phenophases have a direct impact on grain formation, size, dry weight, and number
    of seeds [28]. More specifically, about 50% of all crop yield losses are due to
    abiotic factors such as high temperature (20%), low temperature (7%), salinity
    (10%), drought (9%), and other forms of stress (4%) [29]. Figure 1. Abiotic stress
    factors (frost, heat, waterlogging, drought, salinity and nutrient deficiency)
    and corresponding physiological responses of winter wheat (↑ symbol represents
    increase and ↓ symbol represents decrease). 2.1. Drought Stress Approximately
    80–95% of the plant’s fresh biomass is water, which plays a critical role in different
    physiological processes, including plant growth, development, and metabolism [30].
    Therefore, many authors consider drought as the most important environmental stress
    for various plants, especially in drought-prone regions [30,31]. The extent of
    damage caused by drought cannot be accurately predicted because it depends on
    a number of factors, including rainfall patterns, the soil’s ability to retain
    moisture, and crop water losses through evapotranspiration [32]. Drought results
    from an insufficient amount of precipitation and water in the soil during the
    growing season [33] and is the most limiting factor for wheat production worldwide
    [34]. The effects of drought stress on final wheat yield depend on the severity
    and duration of the stress, and the response varies depending on the phenophase
    of the crop [35,36]. Winter wheat crops are generally very resilient to mild and
    moderate drought stress prior jointing phenophase, and many adverse effects can
    be reversed after rewatering [37,38]. Furthermore, drought stress just before
    anthesis and during the grain filling phenophases is causing reduced number and
    weight of grains [39,40]. In addition, drought stress affected leaf area expansion,
    dry matter distribution, photosynthetic rate, and root growth [36]. Many plant
    functions and growth variables are affected by drought stress [41]. Under such
    conditions, CO2 uptake is reduced due to stomatal closure, which affects respiration,
    photosynthesis, and overall plant development. As a result, the production of
    cell components such as carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins is
    reduced [42]. Severe drought stress in wheat crops also significantly reduces
    the chlorophyll content in leaves and consequently leaf photosynthesis [39]. Drought
    stress can reduce the water potential of wheat leaves due to solute accumulation,
    resulting in a decrease in turgor [43,44]. The determination of leaf water potential
    is an efficient and reliable method to measure the response of plants to water
    deficits, which also affect various gas exchange traits such as stomatal conductance,
    net photosynthetic and transpiration rates, etc. Stomatal conductance and transpiration
    rates generally decrease when the water potential is reduced [42]. Drought-tolerant
    wheat genotypes maintain high turgor potential and relative water content, and
    the maintenance of leaf turgor is an important adaptive mechanism that plays an
    important role in regulating stomatal and photosynthetic activities under drought
    stress conditions [42,45]. Drought stress significantly impairs the efficiency
    of nutrient uptake and utilization by plants. Many important nutrients such as
    nitrogen, magnesium, calcium, etc. are taken up by roots along with water; drought
    restricts the movement of these nutrients by diffusion and mass, resulting in
    delayed plant growth [46]. Some of the adaptive mechanisms to water deficit in
    wheat are morphological in nature, such as avoidance of water deficit through
    deep rooting, reducing leaf area, early flowering, and alternation of leaf waxiness
    and trichome density [47,48]. These adaptive mechanisms can reduce water loss
    and protect against drought stress over longer periods [47,48]. 2.2. Heat Stress
    Drought and heat are two related but different constraints to grain production
    [49]. Temperatures that exceed the limit of adaptability result in heat stress,
    which significantly affects metabolism, plant viability, and possibly the ability
    of plants to resist attack by pathogens [50]. Temperature is an important factor
    affecting all phenophases of wheat plants, such as germination, tillering, stem
    elongation, booting, anthesis, and ripening [51]. Extreme heat has many influences,
    such as the typical acceleration of plant development at higher temperatures and
    the direct physiological effects of high temperatures on plant growth, reproduction,
    and final yield [36]. Considering global warming, Asseng et al. [52] estimated
    that global wheat production decreases by 6% for every 1 °C increase in temperature.
    Unusually high winter temperatures cause rapid plant growth and accelerate the
    growth rate [53]. Heat stress during the vegetative phenophases in winter wheat
    sown in November resulted in an earlier onset of stem elongation and a shortened
    tillering time [54]. During reproductive phenophases, the optimum temperature
    for wheat growth and development is 15–20 °C [55], and wheat is more sensitive
    during this period than during vegetative phenophases [56,57]. Heat stress during
    sensitive phenophases, such as anthesis, where heat has the most negative consequences
    and leads to the loss of pollen viability, causes significant yield losses due
    to the disturbance of the reproductive physiology [53,57]. Frequent short episodes
    of high-temperature stress can negatively affect seed number [58]. During grain
    filling (ripening), extreme heat can accelerate leaf senescence and affect final
    grain weight by shortening grain filling duration [50,59,60]. Hot periods during
    reproductive phenophases are often dry, so plants often suffer from heat and drought
    stress simultaneously [36,61], so it is important to consider both stressors together
    because their combined effect is greater than when considered separately [27].
    Heat stress leads to a change in the water balance of plants [62]. In general,
    water loss under heat stress is higher during the day, mainly due to increased
    transpiration rate, which ultimately affects essential physiological processes
    in plants [32]. It also reduces the number, mass, and extension of roots, which
    limits the supply of water and nutrients to aboveground plant parts [63]. The
    relative water content and the amount of chlorophyll in leaves decrease rapidly,
    and the green parts turn yellow and reach harvest maturity much earlier [50,64].
    It is well known that photosynthesis is an extremely heat-sensitive process [65].
    It can be completely inhibited by high temperature, and a decrease in photosynthesis
    may be due to the inhibition of the activity of the photosystem II (PSII), which
    is the most temperature-unstable element of the photosynthetic electron transport
    chain [65,66]. In addition, high temperature damages the processes responsible
    for light collection and light energy conversion and increases the rate of photorespiration
    [50]. Kumar et al. [67] also found negative effects on soil microbial activity
    as a result of heat stress. 2.3. Salinity Stress Among abiotic stresses, salinity
    stress has emerged as one of the most important threats to the sustainability
    of wheat production, especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world [68].
    Globally, more than 800 million hectares of agricultural land are affected by
    salinity (including saline and sodic soils), representing more than 6% of the
    world’s total land area [69]. Salinity stress produces many symptoms similar to
    those of drought stress [70]. The occurrence of salt in the soil reduces the plant’s
    ability to absorb water, resulting in a reduction in growth rate. This is called
    the osmotic effect or water deficit due to salinity [70,71]. When excessive amounts
    of salt enter the plant through the transpiration stream, the cells of the transpiring
    leaves are damaged, which can lead to a further growth reduction, referred to
    as the salt-specific or ion-excessive effect of salt [71]. Including the effect
    of water deficit, salinity stress affects all major developmental processes of
    winter wheat such as germination, growth rates, photosynthesis and pigments, nutrient
    deficiency, and oxidative stress [72]. During seed germination, the plant responds
    most strongly to soil salinity by either exerting osmotic stress that impedes
    water uptake or causing ion toxicity. These consequences ultimately reduce the
    utilization of seed reserves [73]. It accelerates all phenophases of wheat; reduces
    the leaf number, leaf expansion rate, root–shoot ratio, number of fertile tillers,
    biomass production, spikelet number, and grain weight; and negatively affects
    the grain yield [74,75,76,77,78]. For example, yield losses of up to 45% have
    been observed in wheat grown under saline conditions [79]. The spatial variation
    in salinity arises from interactions between different edaphic factors (permeability,
    pH response, bulk density, geohydrology, topography, and groundwater depth and
    their salinity) [68,80]. Geographic factors, such as elevation, slope, and aspect,
    and agronomic practices, such as fertilization, irrigation, drainage, crop rotation,
    and tillage type, have immense effects on soil salinity [80]. Climatic parameters
    and the effects of global warming also affect the increase in soil salinity [68,80].
    2.4. Nutrient Deficiency Stress Although not directly related to climate change
    and environmental factors, nutrient deficiency is one of the most common stressors
    in wheat production. As sessile organisms, higher plants must cope with a spatially
    and temporally constantly fluctuating availability of soil nutrients [81]. The
    supply of all macronutrients (N, P, S, K, Mg, and Ca) can influence the distribution
    of dry matter between tillers and roots of higher plants. Nitrogen (N) fertilization
    is critical for wheat plant growth and development [82]. Nitrogen is a limiting
    factor for plant growth, as evidenced by lower plant productivity following N
    reduction [83]. Plants quickly perceive the stress of nitrogen deficiency and
    respond with a variety of physiological and metabolic processes. These include
    the degradation of proteins, the reduction of the corresponding enzyme activities,
    the accumulation of carbohydrates, especially starch, the initiation of oxidative
    stress through the formation of H2O2, and the causation of lipid peroxidation
    [84]. Among these events, the reduction of the photosynthetic capacity is one
    of the most important damages caused by N deficiency, which inhibits plant growth
    and development [84]. Under low-nitrogen conditions, the photosynthetic rate and
    the content of chlorophyll a and other pigments decreased after plants suffered
    from N deficiency [85]. The chlorophyll content of wheat leaves is closely related
    to leaf nitrogen since more than half of the nitrogen in a leaf is accounted for
    by the photosynthetic machinery, and it is already known that leaf chlorophyll
    content increases with nitrogen supply and is low under nitrogen deficiency [85,86,87].
    Stem elongation is the most rapid stage of vegetative growth, during which the
    plant establishes a structure for the production of carbohydrates to fill the
    grain—the flag leaf accounts for about 75% of the effective leaf area contributing
    to grain filling [88]. This stage is also very sensitive to nitrogen deficiency
    and therefore provides a good basis for distinguishing plants with different nitrogen
    statuses using hyperspectral sensing in the field [88,89]. Potassium (K+) is a
    highly mobile element in the plant and is translocated from the older to the younger
    tissue. In the case of potassium deficiency, symptoms usually occur first on the
    lower leaves of the plant and progress toward the top as the severity of the deficiency
    increases [90]. Potassium deficiency in wheat causes discoloration of the leaf
    tips and margins, which turn yellow and brown during the rapid growth phase of
    the shoot [91]. As with other cereals, potassium deficiency in wheat often results
    in weakening of the straw, which can lead to lodging [91]. Phosphorus (P2O5) is
    present in the wheat plant in lower concentrations than nitrogen and potassium.
    However, as a component of adenosine di- (ADP) and tri-phosphates (ATP), phosphorus
    directly affects almost all energy-consuming biological processes in the plant,
    such as photosynthesis, respiration, synthesis of cellular components, and membrane
    transport [92]. In younger plants, phosphorus deficiency causes leaves and stems
    to turn blue-green and take on a strong purple color, while older leaves decline
    early. In the reproductive phenophases, the leaves turn purple bronze tones, and
    ears do not develop properly [91]. 2.5. Frost Stress Cold temperatures or frost
    cause tremendous losses in agriculture, especially in cereal crops in subtropical
    and temperate regions [93]. Wheat can be damaged by frost at all phenophases.
    Sensitivity to frost, however, increases as the crop develops. In contrast, the
    risk of frost damage decreases as spring advances [94,95], so it is important
    not to seed winter wheat too early or use rapidly developing varieties that carry
    a high risk of frost damage [95]. A short interval of freezing air has a devastating
    effect on the vegetative and reproductive growth of plants [96]. The freezing
    environment disrupts water uptake by the roots, and a lack of water in the stem
    leads to drought stress [97]. This drought stress due to the disturbed water ratio
    also reduces the root ion absorption rate and nutrient transport to other parts
    of the plant and ultimately leads to plant underdevelopment [40,98]. Wheat is
    reported to be the most susceptible to frost damage when the spike is emerged
    as ice crystals can form directly on the reproductive tissue when the spike is
    no longer protected by the stem and leaf sheath [95]. In addition, frost causes
    flower abortion, infertility, fertilization breakdown, and impaired seed filling,
    resulting in low grain set and ultimately low grain yield [93]. In the study by
    Fuller et al. [99], two wheat cultivars were placed in a freezing chamber for
    2 h with various frost stress treatments. As a result, severe damage to flag leaves
    and spikes was observed, increasing with decreasing temperature. Partial to complete
    loss of grain yield was also observed in the wheat plants studied [99]. 2.6. Waterlogging
    Stress Inadequate soil aeration combined with excessive moisture usually has a
    negative effect on plant growth and leads to waterlogging. This phenomenon is
    becoming an obvious obstacle to agricultural production due to the increasing
    frequency of extremely heavy rainfall [100]. In addition to heavy rainfall, soil
    erosion and poor soil drainage can also be the cause. Waterlogging causes a number
    of physical, chemical, and biological changes in the soil that ultimately inhibit
    the growth of plants that cannot tolerate these conditions [101]. Thus, plants
    growing in waterlogged soils are exposed to unfavorable growth and negative development
    conditions, such as hypoxia (O2 deficiency) or anoxia (O2 deprivation), disruption
    of aerobic respiration, energy deficiency, and oxidative stress [102]. In waterlogged
    soils, CO2, ethylene, manganese, and iron can accumulate to concentrations that
    can be lethal to plants [103]. The roots face the effects of waterlogging first,
    while the upper parts of the plant suffer. Many authors concluded decline of seminal
    roots in wheat [104]. Conversely, waterlogging stimulates aerial root development
    in wheat [101]. Poor soil aeration leads to chlorosis and early leaf senescence
    and also reduces grain weight and yield [103]. The extent of stress to wheat in
    waterlogged soils depends on the phenophase of the crop, duration of waterlogging,
    soil type, and growing conditions [103]. Wheat plants flooded with water for six
    days resulted in 39% and 47% reductions in grain yield on alkaline and sodic soils,
    respectively [105]. 3. Physiological Response of Winter Wheat to Biotic Stress
    Factors Biotic stress is an unfavorable condition in which the plant cannot maintain
    its normal growth due to interaction with harmful organisms such as plant pathogens
    (fungi, bacteria, and viruses), herbivorous insects, and undesirable plant species
    or weeds [106]. Economically, insects, weeds, and diseases regularly affect crop
    quality and yield and reduce agricultural profitability [107]. The consequences
    of biotic stress are poorly understood because physiological effects vary widely
    [108] (Figure 2). Pathogen inoculation and multiplication, herbivore detection
    and defoliation, and competition from weed species are highly variable and interact
    with the abiotic stress factors mentioned earlier [108]. Biotic factors cause
    environmental stress in plants, such as a reduction in net photosynthesis, which
    can be caused by insect feeding, foliar pathogens, or shading by weeds [107].
    The occurrence and harmfulness of insect pests, weeds, and pathogens can be affected
    by changes in climate [20]. For example, rising temperatures are known to promote
    the spread of pathogens [109,110]. Climate change impacts may affect population
    dynamics of insect pests, with temperature increases favoring higher metabolic
    and developmental rates, reproduction, and survival [20]. Weeds are becoming more
    common in some cropping systems [22] and are likely to have greater resilience
    and better adaptability to changes in CO2 concentration and rising temperatures
    due to their diverse gene pool and higher physiological plasticity when competing
    with crops [111]. Major crops growing in our future fields are therefore likely
    to be exposed to a wider range and number of abiotic and biotic conditions, as
    well as their combination. For example, both cold and heat stress have been found
    to reduce plant resistance to biotic stresses [112]. Figure 2. Biotic stress factors
    (diseases, weeds and insect pests) in winter wheat and their corresponding physiological
    responses of winter wheat (↑ symbol represents increase and ↓ symbol represents
    decrease). 3.1. Weeds Weeds directly affect wheat productivity, including the
    cost of labor, machinery, herbicides, and other inputs. They also indirectly affect
    wheat production by competing with crops for resources, providing shelter for
    pests and pathogens, affecting water management, reducing grain yield and quality,
    and increasing processing costs [113,114]. Weeds not only reduce yield but also
    complicate harvesting operations [115]. Most importantly, weeds compete with crops
    for resources such as moisture, nutrients, light, and space, which puts crops
    at a disadvantage in obtaining these resources and can cause abiotic stress due
    to the lack of abiotic elements. In addition, weeds can grow much taller than
    many wheat varieties and partially shade wheat plants, causing them to droop due
    to their weak stems, which can result in severe yield losses [113,114,115]. Yield
    losses can range from 10% to 80%, depending on the occurrence of the weed and
    the phenophase in which the weed occurs [115]. 3.2. Insect Pests During the growing
    season, winter wheat crops are exposed to pests that can significantly reduce
    yields. According to Oerke [116], losses in total small grain production due to
    pest infestations are about 9% worldwide. Cereal leaf beetles, aphids, and sunn
    pest are the most important herbivores in European wheat production [117]. Cereal
    leaf beetles (Oulema melanopus, L., and Oulema lichenis, Voet.) are the main pests
    of winter wheat. They feed by chewing leaves, resulting in peeling of the epidermis
    and loss of tissue. The typical symptoms of both adults and larvae on the host
    plant are thin and long lines where the larvae peel away the epidermis of the
    leaf, while the adults chew completely through the leaf, resulting in narrow slits
    [117,118]. Under uncontrolled circumstances, this damage can worsen in several
    cases, although most photosynthetic surfaces can be affected [117,118]. In wheat,
    the reduction in grain yield per plant by one larva of the cereal leaf beetle
    was 9%, and the reduction by two larvae was 18% [119]. In their study, Lukasz
    et al. [120] indicated that tissue loss from O. melanopus chewing manifests itself
    in the decline of chlorophyll content, and the extent of photosynthetic tissue
    loss can be so pronounced that photosynthetic efficiency decreases. While chewing
    insects cause extensive damage to plant tissue, aphids feed on the phloem sap
    of host plants by penetrating their spines and damage crops by depriving them
    of photoassimilates and transmitting numerous plant viruses [121]. The most wheat-damaging
    aphid species are the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia, Mordvilko), the grain
    aphid (Sitobion avenae, Fabricius), and the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum
    padi, L.) [122]. The persistent interactions of aphid stylet with plant cells
    result in plant responses to aphid infestations [121,123,124]. Probing by aphids
    can be affected by changes in the chemical content of the sieve sap or by physiological
    changes induced by the aphid saliva, which can trigger plant defense signals [121],
    as well as many of the stress symptoms, whose most characteristic symptom is white
    or purple longitudinal stripes on leaves and sometimes on the stem [125,126].
    Leaf rolling can also be caused by feeding damage by aphids. For example, D. noxia
    feeds mainly on the upper leaf surface and causes leaf rolling in cereals resulting
    in a drastic reduction in chlorophyll content and decreased photosynthetic capacity,
    which combined with leaf curling resulted in a significant loss of effective leaf
    area in susceptible wheat plants [127]. In response to herbivore attacks, plants
    defend themselves with a range of defense strategies that include chemical and
    mechanical defense mechanisms, including the production of plant secondary metabolites
    [128,129] such as insecticidal phloem components, including toxic or growth-inhibiting
    alkaloids, proteins, and phenolics [121,130]. The sunn pest belongs to the genera
    Eurygaster and Aelia [131]. When overwintering adults invade wheat fields in spring,
    they damage wheat plants in the vegetative phenophases by sucking on the leaves
    and stems. The nymphs and the new generation of adult pests damage the spikes
    and grains of wheat plants in the reproductive phenophases. By sucking on the
    grains, the adults and the nymphs insert proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes that
    cause the destruction of gluten, which affects the favorable baking properties
    of the flour [132,133]. The infestation of as little as 2-3% of the grain may
    render the entire batch of grain unsuitable for baking due to poor flour quality
    [132,133]. It also causes lower starch content and grain weight [134,135], resulting
    in lower yield and seed viability [136]. Wheat crops are attacked by many pests,
    but not always with the same intensity. The decision to apply chemical pest control
    measures is based on data on the infestation intensity [117]. Integrated pest
    management is based on predicting the occurrence and spread of pests and involves
    the use of insecticides only when there are no other options to reduce the number
    of pests [137,138]. Many herbivorous pests are distributed in patches across fields,
    and because of this spatial heterogeneity, the appropriate scale of detection
    must be applied to determine the distribution pattern of pests within the field
    [139]. All of the above pests occur in heterogeneous areas of the field, which
    is important for monitoring and precise pest management. 3.3. Diseases Pathogenic
    fungi, along with viruses and bacteria, represent a significant obstacle to wheat
    production [140]. An outbreak of these diseases can spread rapidly under favorable
    environmental conditions and result in significant yield and quality losses. Therefore,
    the development of technologies to accurately monitor and identify disease incidence
    is extremely important for agricultural management [141]. The most important diseases
    in winter wheat production are blotch diseases (Septoria sp.), powdery mildew
    (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Marchal), rust species (Puccinia sp.), and
    Fusarium head blight disease [140,142]. Septoria diseases of wheat include two
    important diseases, namely, Septoria nodorum, Berk., and Septoria tritici, Roberge
    in Desmaz. They are currently two of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat
    worldwide and especially in northwestern Europe, causing yield losses every year
    [143,144]. The pathogen causes a decrease in chlorophyll content in leaf tissue.
    The destruction of the chloroplasts and shrinkage of the assimilative surface
    of the leaf lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity and respiratory activity
    [144]. After a latent period, the pathogen enters the necrotrophic phase, and
    infected leaves become chlorotic and change to necrotic, irregularly shaped blotches
    in which asexual, fruiting sporulation forms (pycnidia) develop [145,146]. Yield
    losses occur mainly due to a decrease in grain content within individual spikes
    and a decrease in grain weight in general [147]. Powdery mildew is a well-known
    wheat disease that occurs worldwide [148]. Yield losses can be as high as 40%,
    and early infection can lead to seedling death. The characteristic symptoms of
    the disease are the appearance of white cotton-wool-like mycelia with spores that
    sometimes cover almost the entire leaf surface. The affected plants look weak
    and form shriveled grains [142]. Infection with wheat powdery mildew at the seedling
    stage can affect the growth and development of wheat plants and lead to a decline
    in grain filling and grain weight at the adult stage [149]. Rust diseases (Puccinia
    sp.) are the most widespread diseases in the world [148]. It is estimated that
    annual losses due to wheat rust pathogens are USD 4.3 to USD 5.0 billion worldwide
    [140]. There are three wheat rust diseases: stem rust (P. graminis subsp. graminis
    Pers.), stripe rust (P. striiformis, Westend.), and leaf rust (P. triticina, Eriks.)
    [150]. Symptoms of infection with stem rust typically appear as masses of red
    uredinospores on leaves, stems, glumes, and awns of susceptible cereals. Yield
    losses are associated with reduced grain size and stem lodging [142]. P. striiformis
    causes necrotic stripes or elongated spots that infect the green tissue of wheat
    plants, and chlorosis or necrosis occurs to varying degrees depending on plant
    resistance levels and temperature. The pathogen deprives the host plants of water
    and nutrients, which weakens the plants [151]. Leaf rust occurs more regularly
    and in more regions of the world than stem or stripe rust of wheat. Yield losses
    in wheat due to P. triticina infection are usually the result of a reduced number
    of kernels per head and lower kernel weight, preceded by foliar symptoms manifested
    by small uredinia surrounded by chlorosis or necrosis [152]. Fusarium head blight
    (known as scab) is an economically destructive wheat disease caused by Fusarium
    graminearum, Schwabe [153]. These fungal pathogens produce several mycotoxins,
    particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA), which are poisonous to
    humans and animals [154]. Symptoms are detected at the time of spike emergence.
    The pathogen infects individual spikelets or the entire spike, which turns pale
    and almost white, and under moist conditions, pink spore masses are seen on or
    between spikelets. In early infections, the grains look pink and shriveled, while
    at harvest, black, hard structures (perithecia) are often seen on the infected
    spikes [142]. To determine the occurrence and spread of plant diseases and to
    assess the damage caused in a field, it is important to use crop monitoring programs
    to help with crop protection decision making to minimize crop losses. They are
    especially important for crops with large geographic distributions or for diseases
    that can quickly cause large economic losses [155]. 4. Application of Remote and
    Proximal Sensing Techniques for Environmental Stress Detection in Winter Wheat
    Increasing understanding of how plants respond to abiotic and biotic stresses
    has led to the development of innovative sensing technologies that can estimate
    plant variables. Remote sensing technology allows for the non-contact acquisition
    of information and has been widely used in geoscience and engineering, shedding
    new light on plant phenotyping [156,157,158]. Remote sensing of vegetation is
    a non-destructive method suitable for rapid and accurate assessment of a plant’s
    physiological status and objective evaluation of the plant’s response to natural
    and anthropogenic environmental factors [159]. There are several types of remote
    sensing systems used in agriculture. Most of them are based on the information
    provided by visible and near-infrared radiation (VIS-NIR) reflected (or transmitted)
    from the plant [160]. The radiation reflected from the object (plant) is one of
    the most important properties in the field of remote sensing. It is measured as
    a function of wavelength and referred to as the spectral reflectance [161]. Therefore,
    the most useful wavelengths for remote sensing of vegetation changes include the
    visible (VIS; 400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR; 700–1300 nm), and shortwave infrared
    (SWIR; 1300–2500 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum [162]. Because solar
    energy is the largest component in the VIS, NIR, and SWIR bands, sensors using
    these bands can typically acquire data with a relatively high signal-to-noise
    ratio [162,163]. As a current and cost-effective technology, VIS-NIR-SWIR sensors
    are available on a variety of remote sensing platforms, including ground-based,
    airborne, and satellite-based systems [163]. Crop data that are sensed or collected
    “near” the crop are referred to as proximal sensing [160]. Proximal (remote) sensing
    methods include several approaches, the first of which is VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroradiometry
    (i.e., multispectral or hyperspectral sensor) (Figure 3), the second is infrared
    thermometry, and the third is RGB imaging cameras [160]. The quality of proximal
    and remote sensing data lies in their temporal, spatial, spectral, and radiometric
    resolution, which accounts for their advantages for plant phenotyping [156,158].
    Since near and remote sensors differ in their sensitivities to different wavelengths
    and sizes of objects that can be detected, these differences are referred to as
    the spectral and spatial resolution. The spatial resolution defines the size of
    the pixels that cover the Earth’s surface and refers to the dimensions of the
    smallest object that can be detected on the ground [162]. The spectral resolution
    is the sensitivity of the sensor to different electromagnetic wavelengths of the
    spectrum, i.e., the number and width of wavelengths detected by the sensor (VIS-NIR-SWIR),
    distinguishing between multispectral, hyperspectral, and RGB sensors [164]. In
    recent decades, the number of studies on plant spectral reflectance has increased
    significantly as multispectral and hyperspectral cameras and field spectroradiometers
    have become increasingly capable of accurately measuring the entire electromagnetic
    spectrum (350–2500 nm), from which information for a range of plant traits can
    be obtained [165,166,167]. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors measure the
    spectral reflectance of plants and enable the calculation of vegetation indices
    (VIs) as indicators of plant stress and yield predictions [168]. The VIs can be
    used for site-specific management in precision agriculture [169] and in in situ
    screening for a broad array of plant breeding objectives such as yield potential,
    adaptability to abiotic and biotic stresses, and plant quality [160]. Figure 3.
    Method for obtaining spectral data from pest-infested plants using hyperspectral
    sensor (spectrometer). Vegetation indices (VI) such as NDVI, GNDVI and AI can
    be calculated from the reflectance spectral data. 4.1. Detection and Evaluation
    of Drought Stress in Winter Wheat In wheat research, particular attention has
    been paid to drought stress because of its extremely negative effects on the growth,
    development, and final grain yield [170,171]. In addition to irrigation management,
    a rapid assessment of the water content in wheat plants would allow effective
    screening and identification of resistant cultivars in breeding programs [172].
    Measuring the spectral characteristics of wheat plants represents a simple, rapid,
    practical, and economical technique for assessing various phenotyping criteria
    related to the drought resistance of plants, and high-throughput phenotyping data
    can be used for genomic selection to assess optimal wheat varieties under drought
    stress [158,173]. Several spectral ranges are considered useful for assessing
    drought stress. Based on the vegetation indices calculated from the ratios and
    differences between the reflectances of plant material in VIS, NIR, and SWIR,
    various agronomic plant traits related to drought can be estimated [174]. There
    is increasing evidence that the water content can be estimated remotely by using
    water absorption bands in the NIR to SWIR where there are strong water-absorbing
    features (970 nm, 1200 nm, 1450 nm, 1930 nm, and 2500 nm) [175]. Numerous spectral
    indices have been proposed to remotely estimate the water content of plant tissues
    to provide a measure of the water deficit stress [176,177], mostly based on these
    spectral bands [178]. To improve the extraction of the spectral information on
    water metrics in vegetation and soil, scientists have proposed several hyperspectral
    vegetation indices, including the water index (WI), normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized
    difference water index (NDWI), water band index (WBI), brown pigment index (BPI),
    normalized difference infrared index (NDII), simple ratio water index (SRWI),
    moisture stress index (MSI), spectral ratio index in the NIR shoulder region (NSRI),
    soil adjusted index (SAVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI),
    deep water index (DWI), and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (Red
    edge NDVI) [18,60,179,180,181,182,183,184,185]. Besides the VIS-NIR-SWIR sensors,
    the most advanced proximal and remote sensing techniques to estimate plant water
    stress are thermal infrared (TIR) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) [186].
    Many authors have related spectral characteristics of vegetation (along with derived
    VIs) and physiological parameters to assess the response to a water deficit in
    crops, including relative water content (RWC), canopy water content (CWC), leaf
    water content (LWC), and soil water content (SWC) [175,179,187]. The soil water
    content (SWC) or soil moisture (SM) is an important indicator of the photosynthetic
    rate and growth status of plants. Generally, the level of drought stress in winter
    wheat is evaluated by the soil water status [188,189]. Conventional methods for
    measuring the SWC rely on site-specific surveys, but these are often laborious
    and slow [185]. Some related parameters, such as red edge (the area where vegetation
    reflectance changes rapidly from the red component in VIS to the NIR region of
    EM) and spectral VIs have been used to determine the soil moisture of winter wheat
    [180,190]. In their study, Ren et al. [185] concluded that the spectral index
    based on the optimized index NSRI has good abilities to determine the SWC in the
    jointing, anthesis, and grain filling phenophases of winter wheat. The RWC can
    be determined with high accuracy by spectral remote sensing systems that analyze
    spectral data and provide simple and useful information [187,191]. Tian et al.
    [191] measured wheat leaves radiometrically to spectrally characterize water deficiency
    symptoms. The reflectance spectra of wheat leaves indicated that the water content
    dominated in the range of 1650–1850 nm, from which they concluded that with a
    decrease in the RWC of wheat leaves, the spectral absorption features at 1650–1850
    nm were gradually more expressed. Liu et al. [192] found significant positive
    correlation coefficients between the plant water content (PWC) and spectral reflectance
    in the range of 740–930 nm at different growth stages of winter wheat, suggesting
    that spectral reflectance increases in the NIR and red edge region (680–740 nm)
    due to the effects of the PWC on the internal structure of the leaf. Peng et al.
    [190] investigated the relationship between the CWC and spectral reflectance under
    different water treatments during winter wheat vegetation and concluded that the
    CWC of winter wheat generally decreased as the growth and development progressed.
    Under the various water treatments in this study, CWC increased with increasing
    irrigation volume. In the VIS range, canopy reflectance decreased with irrigation
    volume. In contrast, the canopy reflectance in the NIR range increased with increasing
    irrigation amount. Using different VI, Sun et al. [179] accurately estimated the
    water status of winter wheat expressed as water metrics (LWC, PWC, and CWC) and
    observed a significant correlation between VIs (WI, WBI, MSI, NDWI, NDII, OSAVI,
    PRI, and Red Edge NDVI) and the water metrics, with Red Edge NDVI having the highest
    correlation coefficients with them. Based on numerous studies of water stress
    in plants and applications of remote sensing, there are a large number of accurate,
    reproducible methods that can be applied under a wide range of climatic, soil,
    and growing conditions. Future improvements in water use efficiency, and thus
    high yields in cereal crops, are needed to adapt field practices and irrigation
    schedules [179,187]. 4.2. Detection and Evaluation of Heat Stress in Winter Wheat
    Early detection of heat stress could help mitigate its detrimental effects on
    grain production, which can be assessed using remote sensing technology to help
    markets and governments prepare for grain shortages and organize insurance and
    recovery management [193,194,195,196]. While the use of remote and proximal sensing
    to detect drought has attracted considerable scientific interest, heat stress
    in cereals has not been nearly as well studied. Many studies have shown that photosynthetic
    parameters (i.e., net photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximum and potential efficiency
    of PSII (Fv/Fm and Fv/Fo), stomatal conductance (Gs), and leaf chlorophyll content
    (LCC)) can serve as indicators of heat stress conditions due to their effects
    on photosynthetic decline [32,36,197,198]. Because VIs provide the ability to
    non-destructively observe photosynthetic parameters, they can potentially be used
    as estimators of heat stress in plants [195]. Cao et al. [195] selected potential
    VIs for heat stress detection that were most strongly associated with photosynthetic
    parameters. The PRI was the most sensitive VI for heat stress among the 17 spectral
    indices mentioned, and this sensitivity was due to the relationship between PRI
    and photosynthetic activity, with PRI showing a positive correlation with the
    chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio, which normally decreases under heat stress in plants
    [196,199]. With respect to the LCC, chlorophyll index-red edge (CI red edge) had
    the highest coefficient of determination (R2), and the normalized difference red
    edge index (NDRE) had the highest R2 with respect to Pn; these two indices result
    from the fact that they are closely related to chlorophyll content in plants.
    These results are consistent with those of Ryu et al. [200], who concluded that
    the PRI is the most useful vegetation index under physiological stress caused
    by heat stress in paddy rice. Unlike other VIs, the PRI decreased under the extreme
    heat stress even before rice entered the heading stage. Considering that drought
    stress and heat stress usually occur simultaneously in winter wheat, it is necessary
    to distinguish the symptoms of these two types of stress and thus differentiate
    the spectral characteristics depending on the type of stress. 4.3. Detection and
    Evaluation of Salinity Stress in Winter Wheat Remote detection of salinity stress
    can provide a robust approach for monitoring crop condition, evaluating the economic
    impact of using poor-quality water, and optimizing crop productivity [201]. Many
    studies have derived soil salinity directly from the spectra of salinized soil
    surfaces, but this method is not an option for a salinized soil surface with vegetation
    cover [202,203,204,205]. Identifying and developing salt-tolerant genotypes is
    one of the promising methods to improve the productivity of salt-stressed soils,
    and hyperspectral proximal and remote sensing could be a reliable and rapid method
    [206]. In their study, Elmetwalli et al. [201] compared the spectral responses
    of wheat and corn canopies grown under different salinity and drought stress conditions
    and showed how the spectral curves differed with respect to the stress parameters.
    Using PCA and PLDA, they found that it was possible to distinguish between low
    and high levels of salinity- and moisture-related stress in corn but not in wheat.
    Remotely sensed VIs of crops are also promising indicators of the soil salinity
    [207]. In their study, Zhu et al. [207] measured the hyperspectral reflectance
    of winter wheat during the grain filling phenophases. The VIs derived from the
    collected hyperspectral data of winter wheat were compared with the salinity at
    four soil depths. The results showed that the VIs, which include blue, red edge,
    and near-infrared wavebands, best estimate the soil salinity. The study shows
    that the spectral reflectances of winter wheat illustrate well the physiological
    changes of plants under salt stress and that it is possible to detect the soil
    salinity from the spectral response of plants. 4.4. Detection and Evaluation of
    Nutrient Deficiency Stress in Winter Wheat Intensive cultivation and unbalanced
    fertilization practices have left soils depleted of macronutrients such as N,
    P, and K. Deficiencies in these essential elements can drastically affect the
    growth, development, and yield of wheat [208]. By the time the symptoms of nutrient
    deficiency become clearly visible in the plant, a number of biophysical processes
    have already been disrupted by nutrient deficiency stress, so it is critical to
    detect stress early [209]. Traditional methods for monitoring nutrients in plants
    require sampling and expensive chemical laboratory analysis, which is time consuming
    and sometimes economically and environmentally unacceptable [210]. Ground-, air-,
    and satellite-based remote sensing systems have been successfully used to determine
    plant nutrient requirements [162]. The principle of remote sensing to determine
    nutrient stress in plants is to change the photosynthetic activity and cell structure,
    stretch, and overtones of chemical bonds such as the N–H bond, which alters the
    spectral reflectance of plants [210,211]. However, most studies monitoring nutrient
    deficiencies are related to N deficiency. N is a critical element required for
    biomass formation in agricultural crops. The proportion of chlorophyll in the
    leaf and the corresponding N content are indicators of the N requirement of wheat
    plants [89]. Since the leaf N concentration is related to the chlorophyll amount,
    many remote sensing studies have focused on estimating the chlorophyll concentration
    in leaves to estimate the N status in an indirect way, which is a simpler method
    than the classical laboratory analyses to estimate the N content in the plant
    [212]. A good correlation between canopy reflectance and N accumulation in leaves
    was found by Zhu et al. [213] in a study on rice and wheat, with the best results
    obtained when a ratio of reflectance at 810 nm to reflectance at 660 nm and a
    ratio of reflectance at 870 nm to reflectance at 660 nm were used. Similar results
    were presented by Jia et al. [214], who showed that reflectance at NIR, red, and
    green wavelengths and vegetation indices NDVI, GNDVI (Green normalized difference
    vegetation index), RVI (Ratio vegetation index), and OSAVI were well correlated
    with the N content of wheat plants using high-resolution satellite imagery. N
    deficiency usually leads to a significant increase in the reflectance of the red
    component in the VIS region and a decrease in the NIR region, so this change in
    spectral reflectance is considered key to detecting insufficient N supply to the
    plant [89,215]. Li et al. [216] demonstrated a positive linear relationship between
    index RVI and N uptake in winter wheat using a portable radiometer capable of
    measuring in the 325–1075 nm range. Many authors have identified significant wavelengths
    within the electromagnetic spectrum (515, 520, 525, 550, 575, 743, 1116, 2173,
    and 2359 nm) that correlate with nitrogen content in plants [217]. Some studies
    have shown a correlation between indices based on the red edge spectral region
    and nitrogen content in plants. The DCNI (Double Peak Canopy Nitrogen Index) is
    an example of an index based on the red edge using wavelengths of 720, 700, and
    670 nm [218]. In addition to the DCNI index, the following indices are most commonly
    used in the literature for this purpose: NDVI, CCI (Chlorophyl content index),
    GNDVI, SAVI, OSAVI, and RVI [89,219,220,221]. Since potassium (K) and phosphorus
    (P), along with nitrogen (N), are of paramount importance to crops, monitoring
    their status through remote sensing systems would be prominent. Previous studies
    have shown that hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to accurately estimate
    K content in crops, which could be used for optimal K fertilization [91,210].
    The same authors indicated that the 1450 nm wavelength in the SWIR range was significantly
    correlated with the K content in wheat leaves. Pimstein et al. [91] proposed a
    spectral index based on the ratio 1645–1715, which can be used to determine the
    K concentration in wheat plants. Another study by Yang et al. [222], which examined
    the relationships between spectral reflectance, determined spectroradiometrically,
    and K content in wheat, found a strong correlation with the leaf K content for
    wavelengths in the 1900–2300 nm range. According to previous studies by Pimstein
    et al. [91] and Mahajan et al. [210], a strong correlation between the P concentration
    and spectral reflectance was found in wheat at 1400–1500 and 1900–2100 nm and
    1650–1710 nm [91,210], so these regions of the EM spectrum could be a potential
    area for developing VIs for P monitoring. In addition, Osborne et al. [223] found
    that linear models that included 730 and 930 nm were able to predict the P concentration
    at the V6 growth stage of corn, while for later stages, prediction of the P content
    was possible in the blue region of the spectrum (440 and 445 nm), implying that
    very specific models are needed for different stages, depending on the different
    effects of P concentrations on the plant. 4.5. Detection and Evaluation of Frost
    Stress in Winter Wheat Frost damage is a common disaster for winter wheat, and
    monitoring frost damage is of great economic importance [224]. The advantages
    of remote sensing have led to a number of studies on monitoring the effects of
    spring frost on crops. One of the first reports on the remote sensing of frost
    in wheat was by Jurgens [225], who proposed the modified normalized difference
    vegetation index (mNDVI) as a qualitative spectral indicator of frost damage based
    on the fact that frost-damaged plants reflect radiation differently from dehydrated
    plants, possibly due to damage in the cell structure. Gu et al. [226] found that
    the effects of spring frost on plant development could be seen in the reduced
    NDVI values after the frost event. The mechanism behind the frost-induced decrease
    in VI values has been described in several studies [224,226,227,228]. During freezing
    and after thawing, pigment degradation is greater than composition, resulting
    in a significant decrease in leaf chlorophyll content [229]. It is reported that
    the reflectance in the NIR region decreases due to the changing cell structure,
    while the water absorption band in the SWIR region becomes weaker due to the reduction
    of the water content in the leaf. Consequently, the increasing reflectance in
    the red region and decreasing reflectance in the NIR region lead to a decrease
    in NDVI and EVI values under low-temperature stress [229]. Therefore, Wang et
    al. [229] proposed to use the spring frost damage index (SFDI) and the normalized
    difference phenology index (NDPI), the calculation of which includes the weighted
    sum of the reflectance of the red and SWIR bands. 4.6. Detection and Evaluation
    of Waterlogging Stress in Winter Wheat Waterlogging is becoming a limiting condition
    for crop production as extremely heavy rainfall becomes more frequent worldwide,
    and its early detection is essential for accurately managing production inputs
    and reducing the risks associated with crop production [100,230]. Using various
    machine learning models, Yang et al. [230] found that waterlogging can be well
    detected in the specific sublevels of the wavebands in the red spectral region
    (640–680 nm), red edge region (670–737 nm), and NIR region (700–900 nm). There
    are a few studies on the degree of waterlogging based on remote sensing, which
    mainly focus on monitoring the occurrence of waterlogging and distinguishing between
    different types of environmental stress [100,231,232]. Jiang et al. [233] found
    that spectral VIs, which are based on wavelengths of 800, 550, and 680 nm, are
    optimal for detecting waterlogging stress. Yang et al. [100] conducted a pot experiment
    in which they exposed winter wheat to different levels of waterlogging and collected
    hyperspectral leaf data and LWC values. They concluded that waterlogging leads
    to a decrease in LWC. The NDVI, DVI, RVI, and LWC were also calculated. Using
    the BPNN model with the original and first derivative spectrum, red edge, RVI,
    NDVI, and modified NDVI as independent variables, they were able to invert the
    LWC and estimate waterlogging stress in winter wheat. Using high-spatial-resolution
    satellite data, Liu et al. [234] mapped the waterlogging damage in winter wheat
    fields based on VIs (NDVI, GNDVI, and EVI), LAI, and biomass. 4.7. Detection and
    Assessment of Biotic Stress Due to Weed Occurrence Weeds cause notorious yield
    losses in crops and are usually more economically important than other biotic
    stresses [235]. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of crop stress caused
    by weeds at large spatial and temporal scales because yield reductions caused
    by weeds cannot be separated from variation caused by climatic and edaphic conditions
    or geographic areas and from other biotic stress parameters [236]. However, there
    are a number of scientific data on the incorporation of remote sensing techniques
    into the decision-making process that is fundamental to site-specific crop protection
    against weeds [237,238,239,240]. More recently, various multispectral or hyperspectral
    sensors are capable of providing high-resolution data on crop canopy conditions
    that can form the basis for early detection and identification of weed species
    [239]. Numerous machine learning methods (ML) have been used in precision agriculture,
    where weed detection in the field is based on specific shape, color, and texture
    descriptors (i.e., the morphological characteristics of weed leaves as features
    for further classification) [241]. In their study, López-Granados et al. [242]
    used spectral reflectance data in the 400 to 900 nm range to classify monocotyledonous
    weeds from wheat plants in a field study. They concluded that real-time analysis
    of high-spectral-resolution images was sufficient to map weed patches in wheat.
    Eddy et al. [243] tested an artificial neural network (ANN) for classifying weeds
    (wild oats species and redroot pigweed) and crops (spring wheat, canola, and field
    pea) using hyperspectral images and achieved an overall accuracy of 94%. In their
    work, Shapira et al. [244] used general discriminant analysis (GDA) to detect
    grasses and broadleaf weeds in cereals and broadleaf crops. Using spectral reflectance
    values obtained by field spectroscopy, the total spectral classification of canopies
    by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 ± 4.19% for wheat and 94 ± 5.13% for chickpea.
    The results of the study by de Castro et al. [245] showed that multispectral aerial
    imagery can be successfully used to map the area of cruciferous weed patches in
    wheat and legume stands for site-specific treatment mapping. Creating images to
    classify cruciferous weeds based on multispectral sensors is possible when plants
    are in the vegetative (green) phenophases, while cruciferous weeds are in the
    early or full flowering phenophase, when they have an intense yellow color. Martın
    et al. [246] investigated the potential of hyperspectral data to discriminate
    between two weed species (Lolium rigidum, Gaudin, and Avena sterilis, L.) in winter
    wheat and barley crops. They found that the far SWIR range (1900–2500 nm) was
    particularly important for distinguishing A. sterilis in the phenophases of stem
    elongation and grain filling. In contrast, for L. rigidum, the best results were
    obtained with the early SWIR range (1300–1900 nm) in the phenophases of late tillering
    and stem elongation. These authors also chose the red edge part of the EM spectrum
    (680–780 nm), which is as sensitive for weed discrimination. 4.8. Detection and
    Assessment of Biotic Stress Due to Insect Pest Infestations Remote sensing of
    insects is challenging due to the cryptic nature of many taxa and the limitations
    imposed by spectral data resolution. Insects are often orders of magnitude smaller
    than the spatial resolution or pixel size of many remote sensing systems, so their
    monitoring and detection can be easily overlooked [247]. Insect-caused damage,
    such as defoliation and stress symptoms on plants, is often easily observed with
    remote sensing systems and has long been used for indirect insect detection [247,248],
    which is an important component of crop protection strategies and site-specific
    pest management [163]. Several studies have shown that insect herbivory affects
    photosynthesis through defoliation and chlorophyll loss [120,127,137]. As a result,
    the spectral reflectance of leaves changes accordingly due to lower light absorption
    by leaf pigments [249]. Many authors have noted that differences in spectral reflectance
    can be seen in several wavelength ranges, including a band at 450–500 nm corresponding
    to the green color in the VIS range, a chlorophyll absorption band at 625–675
    nm, and an NIR band [250,251]. The above bands are commonly provided in satellite-based
    multispectral sensors such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, SPOT, etc. and in a variety
    of airborne multispectral sensors [252,253]. In their work, Luo et al. [254] showed
    significant differences between the spectral signatures of a leaf infested with
    the wheat aphid S. avenae and a non-infested leaf, as well as in the values of
    the vegetation indices NDVI and GNDVI, the red edge vegetation stress index (RVSI),
    and the aphid index (AI). The reflectance of the infested leaf was higher in the
    VIS and SWIR regions and lower in the NIR region of the EM spectrum. Elliot et
    al. [255] used aerial multispectral imaging to investigate the damage caused by
    D. noxia to wheat crops, and the authors were able to relate vegetation indices
    to the amount of infested plants. In their study, Mirik et al. [256] found that
    D. noxia significantly increased reflectance in the VIS range and decreased reflectance
    in the NIR range at the canopy level compared with uninfested plants. This statement
    provided evidence that D. noxia feeding degrades photosynthetic pigments and alters
    the leaf morphology in wheat canopies. Since the leaf morphology has a strong
    influence on the spectral signatures of leaves [256,257], its alteration by D.
    noxia feeding resulted in optical differences between infested and uninfested
    plants. Genc et al. [258] investigated the potential of spectroradiometrically
    determined vegetation indices (NDVI and structure insensitive pigment index, SIPI)
    as indicators of damage by sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps, Put.) under field
    conditions. They concluded that spectral measurements detect the different sunn
    pest stages on wheat and also the sunn pest densities in controlled trials, with
    higher numbers of individuals resulting in lower reflectance in the NIR range.
    Higher reflectance values in the VIS region and lower reflectance values in the
    NIR region indicate that lower chlorophyll concentration leads to lower photosynthetic
    rate of wheat [258]. The basic requirement for hyperspectral remote sensing to
    identify insect pests is to detect changes in leaf reflectance caused by insect
    infestation and damage. However, as mentioned earlier in this study, leaf damage
    can be caused not only by insect infestation but also by other biotic and abiotic
    stress factors, making it important to accurately determine the cause of the plant
    stress and damage. In this context, Backoulou et al. [259] showed that spatial
    data from multispectral images can be used to identify spatial patterns of insect
    damage to plants. They also applied this strategy to quantify the extent of stress
    caused by D. noxia in wheat fields and to distinguish this damage from that caused
    by unfavorable agronomic conditions and drought [249]. In their study, Yuan et
    al. [260] demonstrated the potential use of hyperspectral data to discriminate
    between wheat diseases (yellow rust and powdery mildew) and S. avenae infestations
    in winter wheat. 4.9. Detection and Assessment of Biotic Stress Due to Diseases
    Remote sensing techniques using RGB cameras and multispectral and hyperspectral
    sensors have been used to detect various plant diseases [261]. Fungal pathogen
    infection causes various biochemical, physiological, and morphological changes
    in leaves and can be detected using spectral reflectance data in the VIS and NIR
    regions of the EM spectrum [144]. Remote sensing and mapping methods have been
    proposed as innovative tools to improve plant disease management [262,263,264].
    This idea is based on precision agriculture approaches where site-specific fungicides
    are applied based on remote sensing data and GIS [265]. Using hyperspectral imaging,
    leaf diseases can be detected at an early stage prior to the appearance of visible
    symptoms, which has proven to be a useful tool for detecting and differentiating
    fungal diseases in wheat [144,265,266,267]. Some foliar diseases can cause chlorophyll
    loss, while others can lead to leaf water deficits [260]. Consequently, infected
    plants may have different characteristics in the chlorophyll and/or water absorption
    regions of their spectral reflectance curves, in contrast to healthy plants [264].
    Yu et al. [264] investigated the potential of different spectral traits to robustly
    estimate the severity of Septoria infection at the canopy level in wheat genotypes.
    They demonstrated that the canopy reflectance and the selected VIs were promising
    for disease quantification, with the NDWI index performing better compared with
    other VIs. The study by Anderegg et al. [268] demonstrates the potential of time-resolved
    canopy reflectance data for assessing foliar disease in the context of breeding
    for resistance to Septoria blotch. In particular, the temporal dynamics of the
    green leaf area index, in conjunction with the dynamics of physiological senescence,
    is an important indicator of the presence of Septoria infection and its severity.
    Therefore, the values of VIs (modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index 2-MCARI2
    and SIPI) could allow the evaluation of these traits with very high throughput.
    Bravo et al. [269] used hyperspectral imaging for the early detection of yellow
    rust disease (P. striiformis) in winter wheat in the spectral range between 463
    and 895 nm. They found that infected plants had higher reflectance in the VIS
    region and higher absorbance in the NIR region, which was due to lower chlorophyll
    activity, mainly due to degradation of the internal leaf structure. Huang et al.
    [270] investigated the relationship between P. striiformis infection and PRI index
    in wheat, finding that PRI detects yellow color changes with a correlation coefficient
    of (R2 > 0.9). Ashourloo et al. [265] detected leaf rust (P. triticina) in wheat
    in a controlled environment using the VIs (NDVI, PRI, Greenness Index-GI, and
    RVSI) with accuracy greater than 60%. Cao et al. [266] studied 17 VIs for predicting
    powdery mildew in wheat and reported that the difference vegetation index (DVI),
    triangle vegetation index (TVI), and red edge peak area were highly correlated
    with disease severity under field conditions. Lorenzen and Jensen [271] found
    a change in reflectance in the visible spectrum of barley leaves infected with
    powdery mildew. Graeff et al. [272] found that the most sensitive reflectance
    response to leaf damage from wheat powdery mildew infection was in the 490–780
    nm range. Bauriegel et al. [273] analyzed wheat plants with a hyperspectral imaging
    system under laboratory conditions and applied principal component analysis (PCA)
    to distinguish spectral reflectance data from Fusarium diseased and healthy wheat
    spike tissues in the wavelength ranges of 500–533 nm, 560–675 nm, 682–733 nm,
    and 927–931 nm. Fusarium infections in spikes were successfully detected at BBCH
    stages from 71 (watery ripe stage) to 85 (soft dough stage). However, it was found
    that the optimal time for disease detection was at the beginning of medium milk
    stage (BBCH 75). 5. Data Analysis in Proximal and Remote Measurements of Environmental
    Stress There are two main areas to consider when applying remote and close sensing
    techniques to precision agriculture: data acquisition and data analysis methods.
    Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery and sensor data collected by various platforms
    provide a wealth of information about vegetation characteristics [274]. Using
    remote sensing data, scientists can characterize specific environmental stresses
    by calculating and developing spectral vegetation indices, multivariate models,
    and machine learning methods in modeling the spectral and imaging measurements
    [256,275,276]. 5.1. Vegetation Indices The VI, calculated from the absorption
    and reflectance properties of vegetation (e.g., in the red and NIR regions), is
    commonly used to monitor vegetation vigor and indicate plant growth status [277,278].
    A remote sensing time series VI can reflect the status of winter wheat throughout
    the growth and development cycle from sowing to harvest [279]. Table 1 shows a
    summary of the most commonly used VI of environmental stress in winter wheat that
    are listed in this paper. The timely detection of crop stress enables rapid coordination
    and adjustment of planned agrotechnical measures and avoidance of negative effects
    on yield, which is one of the postulates of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture,
    a management approach based on observing, measuring, and responding to crop variability
    within a field, includes data collection to characterize spatial field variability,
    mapping, and in-field decision making and implementation [169]. The development
    of remote sensing influenced a greater number of precision agriculture applications
    and enabled the development of vegetation indices as indicators of crop stress
    and yield predictions [168]. Today, vegetation indices are used in wheat crops
    to assess abiotic and biotic stress. In addition to stress assessment, vegetation
    indices play an irreplaceable role in predicting the biomass and final grain yield
    [280]. Table 1. Vegetation indices used for environmental stress detection and
    evaluation in winter wheat crops. 5.2. Multivariate (Chemometric) Models and Machine
    Learning Methods To obtain more comprehensive information on the state of crops,
    it is essential to examine the entire EM spectrum. The use of multivariate regression
    techniques and machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs),
    can utilize the full spectrum to detect crop stress [281]. Valuable examples of
    chemometric and statistical techniques for estimating vegetation biophysical variables
    from spectral measurement data are partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal
    component regression (PCR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) [282].
    Since chlorophyll content in plants is a biophysical variable representative of
    canopy photosynthetic activity and its level is influenced by numerous stress
    factors, Atzberger et al. [282] investigated the predictive power and noise sensitivity
    of SMLR and “full spectrum” methods PCR and PLSR in their work. In [282], PLSR
    showed the lowest cross-validated RMSE while being relatively insensitive to artificial
    noise in given dataset. The large volume and accuracy of the proximal and remote
    sensing data acquired by various platforms pose a “Big Data” problem. Data acquired
    from these platforms must be properly archived and retrieved for further analysis.
    ML is used when large datasets are available that relate inputs (e.g., imagery
    or spectral data) to desired outcomes (e.g., stress detection). The advantage
    of using ML is the ability to search large datasets to discover patterns and guide
    discovery by simultaneously observing a combination of factors rather than analyzing
    each feature individually [283]. ML methods such as support vector machines (SVM),
    artificial neural networks (ANNs), and kernel methods have been used to detect
    various stress factors. The SVM method has been successfully used in a variety
    of scenarios for stress detection in plants [283]. Recently, the combination of
    linear models such as PCA or PLSR with ML methods, especially nonlinear models
    such as ANN, has gained great popularity [206]. 6. Conclusions This report discusses
    the current state of the art and capabilities of remote and proximal sensing technologies
    that have been used in precision agriculture over the past few decades with various
    applications to detect, evaluate, and monitor environmental stressors in winter
    wheat. Among abiotic factors, the most important plant stressors include drought,
    heat stress, salinity, nutrient deficiency, frost, and waterlogging, while biotic
    stressors include weeds, pests, and diseases. As climate change significantly
    impacts winter wheat production due to more frequent occurrences of various abiotic
    stress parameters as well as improved conditions for weed, pest, and disease development,
    the need for these technologies can only increase in the future. For sustainable
    agricultural management, all factors affecting crop production must be analyzed
    on a spatiotemporal basis. The future perspective concerns stress detection algorithms
    that operate reliably in space and time and are able to distinguish, for example,
    water-, disease-, or pest-related stress signals from “noise” caused by soil and
    other non-photosynthetically active plant material. Distinguishing stress factors
    from multispectral and hyperspectral data is also important for making appropriate
    and accurate crop management decisions, but advanced statistical, chemometric,
    and especially machine learning models are making this goal increasingly achievable.

  description: Enhancing resource use efficiency in agricultural field management
    and breeding high-performance crop varieties are crucial approaches for securing
    crop yield and mitigating negative environmental impact of crop production. Crop
    stress sensing and plant phenotyping systems are integral to variable-rate (VR)
    field management and high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP), with both sharing

    for VR field management have been studied for decades, aiming to establish more

    system development have provided a technological foundation for reducing conventional
    phenotyping costs. In this paper, we present a systematic review of crop stress
    sensing systems employed in VR field management, followed by an introduction to
    the sensors and data pipelines commonly used in field HTPP systems. State-of-the-art
    sensing and decision-making methodologies for irrigation scheduling, nitrogen

    Furthermore, we discuss current challenges and propose potential solutions for
    field HTPP research. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, robotic platforms,
    and innovative instruments is expected to significantly enhance system performance,
    encouraging broader adoption by breeders. Direct quantification of major plant
    physiological processes may represent one of next research frontiers in field
    HTPP, offering valuable phenotypic data for crop breeding under increasingly unpredictable
    weather conditions. This review can offer a distinct perspective, benefiting both

  description: 'Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology
    are integrated under the umbrella title "Artificial Intelligence of Things" (AIoT).
    AIoT seeks to improve data management and analytics, increase human-machine interactions,
    and streamline IoT operations. The IoT is an interconnected system of computing
    devices, mechanical and digital machines, and items that may send data over a
    network without requiring human or computer-to-human interaction. Any device that
    can be assigned an Internet Protocol address and communicate data across a network
    is considered an IoT item. Examples include an implanted heart monitor or a car
    with built-in sensors that alert the driver when the tyre pressure is small. As
    AI enhances IoT through connectivity, signaling, and data exchange while IoT enhances
    AI through machine learning capabilities and enhanced decision-making processes,
    AIoT is a game-changer and mutually beneficial technology for both types of technology.
    The IoT may look up businesses and their services by adding value to the data
    they produce. Using AI, the IoT device may assess, learn from, and make judgments
    without the assistance of a human. The current chapter presents two new approaches
    towards the AIoT and IoT applications: AIoT-based water management system and
    IoT-based smart irrigation system which are very successful in smart agriculture

  description: Technological advancements have led to an increased use of the internet
    of things (IoT) to enhance the resource use efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness
    of agricultural production systems, particularly under the current scenario of
    climate change. Increasing world population, climate variations, and propelling
    demand for the food are the hot discussions these days. Keeping in view the importance
    of the abovementioned issues, this manuscript summarizes the modern approaches
    of IoT and smart techniques to aid sustainable crop production. The study also
    demonstrates the benefits of using modern IoT approaches and smart techniques
    in the establishment of smart- and resource-use-efficient farming systems. Modern
    technology not only aids in sustaining productivity under limited resources, but
    also can help in observing climatic variations, monitoring soil nutrients, water
    dynamics, supporting data management in farming systems, and assisting in insect,
    pest, and disease management. Various type of sensors and computer tools can be
    utilized in data recording and management of cropping systems, which ensure an
    opportunity for timely decisions. Digital tools and camera-assisted cropping systems
    can aid producers to monitor their crops remotely. IoT and smart farming techniques
    can help to simulate and predict the yield production under forecasted climatic
    conditions, and thus assist in decision making for various crop management practices,
    including irrigation, fertilizer, insecticide, and weedicide applications. We
    found that various neural networks and simulation models could aid in yield prediction
    for better decision support with an average simulation accuracy of up to 92%.
    Different numerical models and smart irrigation tools help to save energy use
    by reducing it up to 8%, whereas advanced irrigation helped in reducing the cost
    by 25.34% as compared to soil-moisture-based irrigation system. Several leaf diseases
    on various crops can be managed by using image processing techniques using a genetic
    algorithm with 90% precision accuracy. Establishment of indoor vertical farming
    systems worldwide, especially in the countries either lacking the supply of sufficient
    water for the crops or suffering an intense urbanization, is ultimately helping
    to increase yield as well as enhancing the metabolite profile of the plants. Hence,
    employing the advanced tools, a modern and smart agricultural farming system could
    be used to stabilize and enhance crop productivity by improving resource use efficiency
    of applied resources i.e., irrigation water and fertilizers.

    Keywords: smart farming; sensors; precision farming; yield prediction; IoT; vertical
    farming 1. Introduction Technological advancements have revolutionized almost
    all sectors, particularly agriculture, in the modern world. Likewise, the agricultural
    sector, which is a very risk-averse [1], has also been transforming over time,
    and is aiming at producing more yield and better quality food by establishing
    and maintaining better crops. In order to diversify and improve the natural population
    of crops and to enhance the genetic variability, techniques such as mutagenesis,
    traditional breeding, gene editing, and marker-assisted breeding has been under
    practice for years [2]. However, climate change has impacted the agriculture sector
    [3], whereas adaptations to climate change and advances in agricultural-related
    aspects, such as optimal natural resources usage and limiting the deteriorating
    environmental impacts altogether, have given the farming sector a new face and
    dimension. Efficiency of the agriculture sector is threatened due to world population
    pressure on global production systems, changing climate [4], and crops or food
    losses due to mishandling [5]. According to the United Nations prediction about
    the increase in population, a world population of 9.8 billion is expected by the
    year 2050, and this number may hit 11.2 billion after 70–80 years [6]. Keeping
    these stats in mind, food production must be increased up to 50% to meet the food
    demand of this increasing population and ensure food security. Smart farming,
    often known as smart agriculture, is a farming practice that uses sustainable
    methods to meet the population’s growing food needs while minimizing negative
    effects. The global community has embraced it and is supporting it. The fundamental
    tenet of this strategy is to effectively utilize the resources at hand for sustainable
    output while lowering the expenses of all activities associated with the agricultural
    industry [7]. Smart agriculture represents the use of technologies such as sensors;
    the internet of things (IoT) [8], which is a network of computing devices; artificial
    intelligence; and robotics [9] to assist traditional agriculture and convert it
    into a smart and sustainable agriculture [10]. In fact, the IoT is the combination
    of modern technologies that has the potential to provide modern solutions to agricultural
    problems [8]. Additionally, with the help of data mining technologies [11], a
    large number of datasets, either agronomical [12], genomics [13], or meteorological
    [14], are partitioned into useful information to make easy and efficient decision
    making [15] in order to make farming activities more precise and efficient. Climatic-
    or soil-related data in smart agriculture and farming is obtained using sensors
    [16], and then automatic processing of this big data is carried out with the help
    of modern methods and analysis tools, such as machine learning [17], spike and
    slab regression analysis, and time-series analysis [18]. This process gives the
    obtained data an easy, understandable, and knowledgeable form, which then warns
    the farmers about any upcoming climatic events, i.e., droughts or heavy rains,
    chances of insect or pest infestation, and the spread of infectious disease (i.e.,
    fungal diseases) [19]. Following the warning alerts, this IoT based agriculture
    system blended with ecological sensing and assisted with image processing techniques
    [20] helps farmers in adopting precautionary measures and in customizing the planning
    of crop management practices, i.e., irrigation, fertilization, and pest management,
    with the help of modern digital and internet-assisted tools and smart applications
    as presented in the Figure 1. Figure 1. An architecture of smart farming components:
    Monitoring to end use applications. The internet of things provides efficient
    ways to assist the farmers and researchers in the agricultural crop production
    sector. Moreover, it assists the decision making by making various information
    readily available when it comes to soil [16], water [21], pesticides [22], fertilizers
    [23], and manures [24]. Climate change and global warming are the burning issues
    of the world, with a lot of studies and resources being spent to ensure a better
    future for the coming generations. With the IoT availability [13], increased benefits
    [25,26] can be made available for this cause by concentrating on the sustainability
    of the resources and by protecting the earth with wise decision making [20]. Additionally,
    the IoT can help agriculturists and farmers to not only grow the crops smartly,
    but to effectively deal the post-harvesting and the end consumer’s deals on the
    agricultural products [27]. In addition to this, IoT effectively contributes to
    precision farming with technologies including drones for agriculture [28], remote
    sensing [29], smart greenhouses [30], smart livestock management [31], computer
    imaging [32], and efficient climate monitoring [33] as indicated in the Figure
    2. Data mining and simulation modeling of various crops [12], environmental situations,
    and their management [34] are receiving a lot of attention. Researchers are developing
    new algorithms to ensure more vigorous and detailed information [35] for better
    and improved decision making. These techniques have also been used in fertilizer
    application suggestions [36], i.e., timing and rate of applications, disease,
    yield predictions [37,38], soil moisture detection, and in scheduling irrigation
    [39]. Keeping in view the importance of smart techniques, the objectives of the
    study were to summarize the latest applications of smart techniques, including
    (i) yield estimation, (ii) irrigation and fertilizer management, and (iv) insect,
    pest, and disease monitoring and management in crop production, particularly under
    changing climate. Schematic diagrams and figures created and used in this review

    hub of IoT based smart farming applications in smart agriculture. 2. Climate Change
    and Its Effects on Various Crops: A Need of Smart Crop Production Climate change
    has severely impacted agriculture worldwide [40]. Rising temperature, fluctuations
    during day and night temperature, and seasonal variability in the rainfalls has
    increased the intensity of extreme weather events, i.e., droughts, flash floods
    [40,41,42,43], and incidence of disease occurrence have increased [44]. Efficiency
    of production systems has been affected, and the impact of climate change has
    triggered the need for and the adoption of climate-smart adaptation options to
    sustain productivity and availability throughout the year. Such adaptation options
    and technologies need to be adopted in almost all aspects related to agricultural
    crop production, such as soil–water dynamics, nutrients, and fertilizers [41,45]
    management, improvements in crop types and evaluations [46], applications of beneficial
    elements [47], organic amendments in soil [48], fisheries, livestock, and poultry,
    and farm mechanization, as indicated in Figure 3. Temperature is one of the critical
    factors in crop production. Figure 3. Climatic impacts on agriculture and adaptation
    technologies to combat climate change. Numerous studies have been carried out
    regarding temperature and its effect on various vegetative and reproductive phases
    in crops [49,50]. A productivity decline has been observed in various crops, such
    as peaches and plums, which refers to a change in the temperature pattern of a
    low chilling zone [51]. Moreover, a shift has been observed due to an increase
    in temperature in the choices of different varieties in bananas, grapes, and other
    horticultural crops, which ultimately yield a better product to this changing
    climate. A periodic change in climate is inducing a significant impact on the
    production of certain spices such as cardamom and black pepper [52]. Biomass production
    and total yield of potato has been affected by the elevated temperature, and an
    effective decrease in gross photosynthesis has been noticed [53]. Despite increased
    biomass production, a 14% decrease in seed yield has been observed by Ruiz-Vera
    et al. [54] while growing maize at an elevated temperature of 25.4 ± 1.6 °C. Tip
    burn and leaf desiccation have been noticed in San Joaquin, Imperial, and Salinas
    Valley in the United States due to higher temperatures in lettuce, which eventually
    affected its growth and maturation [55]. Specific ranges of temperature are finalized
    for the effect of temperature on crop growth and productivity. However, an increase
    in temperature results bolting in cole crops, which is not a desirable attribute
    while growing it for vegetable purpose [56]. The temperature range 25–35 °C is
    considered as the moderate range for most crops, where they show the best thriving
    and productive attributes [41,57]. However, the temperature below the moderate
    range is the temperature where the growth is slow and unsteady. According to Ounlert
    and Sadoode [58] and Ounlert et al. [59], the temperature of 38–40 °C is quite
    high for most crops and their optimum production. Likewise, temperatures below
    5 °C is where there is no production of fruit at all for different agronomic and
    horticultural crops, i.e., mangosteen. If the temperature exceeds 42 °C and 45
    °C, it causes the suppression in the germination of cucumber and melon seeds,
    respectively, while the same trend has been observed at 42 °C in watermelon, summer
    squash, winter squash, and pumpkin seeds [60]. Dry periods are very important
    for fruit trees such as mangosteen to stimulate flowering, and various studies
    have observed the same trend. It is reported that a dry period of 15–20 days is
    required to induce the flowering in the mangosteen [61]. Moreover, it has been
    observed that, in case of mangosteen, flowering increased as the drought period
    before the flowering increased. Delayed curd initiation has been recorded in cauliflower
    when the daily temperature exceeded 30 °C [62]. Uneven head in broccoli and reduced
    tomato sizes were reported when the temperature increased above 25 °C for certain
    period, the traits of which are not very much liked by the end consumers. Rai
    et al. [63] reported that insufficient chilling is responsible for lowering fruit
    texture and taste, while high temperature and moisture stress bring cracking in
    fruit trees such as apple and apricot. Summarizing the various symptoms such as
    bud drop, abnormal flower development, poor pollen production, dehiscence, and,
    ultimately, yield losses has been reported by Hazra et al. [64] due to an increase
    in the temperature for tomato. Climate change, variability, and its impact have
    some serious impacts on all the agricultural commodities. There is a change in
    phenology of crops and horticultural fruit trees with the observed changes in
    the rainfall pattern. Changes in rainfall and temperature affects the flowering
    dates of fruit trees [59]. Research had been carried out to investigate the minimum
    and maximum rainfall and its impact on crop production. If the rainfall received
    by the mangosteen is >2500 mm, then there is no need to irrigate it manually,
    while the range of 1270–2500 mm needs a checked irrigation to keep mangosteen
    hydrated and fit for growth and flowering [65]. Rainfall below the 1270 mm ultimately
    limits the growth and overall fruit and flower production. Humidity, like rainfall,
    plays a vital role in ensuring the best thriving fruit in mangosteen production,
    and it has been suggested that the humidity level of 75–80% is optimum for the
    mangosteen [65]. Optimum soil moisture levels should be maintained to keep the
    enough water available for the roots to absorb and transport it to the whole tree.
    Various management levels are required to meet the effective requirements of the
    crops, even within an irrigated area. Soil moisture, irrigation, and rainfall
    are the pivotal entities to fulfill the net water requirements of a crop [66].
    Based on water deficit analysis, Li et al. [66] suggested that rainfall, coupled
    with irrigation, proved an increased yield of sorghum, corn, and soybean in the
    Jilin region of China. In addition, rainfall is an indicator of the crop water
    requirement as well as an indicator of the irrigation requirement for all these
    crops. To measure the glucosinolates contents in variety of vegetables, such as
    cauliflower, cabbage, kale, reddish, turnips, and brussels sprouts, it has been
    found that climatic factors, including the varying rainfall, influence the accumulation
    of these secondary metabolites in vegetables. However, AZM et al. [67] reported
    that both soil and environmental factors are going to impact the production of
    winter vegetables. The rainfall patterns of 2000–2001 and 2002–2003 was the deciding
    factor for the reduction in the fresh pod weight of okra in the inland valley,
    and it played a significant role in pest development, disease onset, and in soil
    chemistry [68]. There is always a negative reaction of crops towards climate change,
    but vegetables are generally more prone to its adverse conditions [69]. Furthermore,
    climate change is also responsible for bringing strong winds, storms, hurricanes,
    and tornadoes to various parts of the world that are the foregrounds of agricultural
    productivities. When faced by these strong winds, the branches of trees and crops
    are prone to damage. Leaf tearing of broad leaves has also been observed in various
    crops, while difficulty in carrying out agricultural operations demands increased
    investment in agriculture. Keeping in view the climate change aspects, it becomes
    important to adopt modern techniques and methodologies to sustain the efficiency
    of farming systems, which ultimately leads to stable crop productivity under diverse
    environmental conditions and contributes to food security. 3. Yield Prediction
    in Smart Agriculture Crop yield is an important entity, and yield prediction is
    a salient and challenging task in agriculture. Soil properties, meteorological
    data and seasonal fluctuations, seed quality, harvesting methods, monitoring of
    pests and diseases, managing nutrient deficiencies, and maintaining water requirements
    for the crops are all contributing factors for predicting the overall yield of
    a plant or crop. Precision agriculture has been used for years and now researchers
    are considering the use of variable rate technologies [70], sensor monitoring
    [16], and management systems to ensure better crop health [27], improved productivity
    [28], and better quality [71] of the produce. Sensor- and drone-assisted quality
    monitoring of horticultural crops [21], yield predicting sensors [72] on harvesters
    of various agronomic crops [73] (Figure 4), and use of the internet and real time
    data simulators [74] are receiving attention day by day, particularly for their
    use in large scale crop production. Figure 4. Sensors- and drones-assisted quality
    monitoring of horticultural crops and yield prediction during harvesting of crops.
    Simulation models have been introduced for yield simulations which are assisting
    in understanding the behaviors of varying yield in relation to fluctuating environment,
    nutrient, water, pest, diseases, and other field conditions [38,75,76]. The CROPGRO
    model [77] was especially designed for simulating different grain legume crops
    such as soybean, groundnut, and common dry bean crops. In an experiment for predicting
    the yield of tomatoes in glasshouse, Qaddoum et al. [78] used an EFuNN (Evolving
    Fuzzy Neural Network) model which predicted fluctuations in the weekly yield of
    tomato with an average accuracy of 90%. Cropping system models, such as APSIM
    and ARMOSA, consider the soil physical and chemical conditions (i.e., water dynamics,
    nutrient cycling) and perform accurate predictions of products such as grain,
    biomass, or sugar yield in response to climate and management conditions [79,80].
    These insights make the model a pivotal choice for the farmer’s adaptation to
    the external changes, and allow simulations to understand the farmer’s response
    to varying seasons and climate changes [81,82]. The Erosion Policy Integrated
    Climate (EPIC), currently known as Environmental Policy Inte-Climate, model is
    another comprehensive model which is under continuous improvements and has the
    capacity to simulate crop growth, heat and water balance, wind and water erosion,
    and nutrient cycling [83]. This model helps in understanding the soil dynamics
    and their relationship to crop management while keeping the soil erosion details
    in consideration. Various environmental components are considered, and their impact
    on crop production have been evaluated using modern techniques. For example, soybean
    productivity was observed, and the influence of relative humidity, evapotranspiration,
    temperature, and precipitation over it was predicted by Veenadhari et al. [84].
    Using ID3 algorithm, Veenadhari et al. [84] reported that humidity has the most
    prominent effect on yield, followed by temperature and precipitation. In another
    study, temperature and humidity sensors were used to suggest the appropriate crop
    and to carry out an effective irrigation control. Moreover, climatic parameters
    such as soil temperature, air temperature, and humidity were also considered.
    Varman et al. [85] discussed, in their research work, various machine learning
    models, such as Feed Forward Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and
    GRU, and concluded that LSTM was the most fit model for his research, in which
    they calibrated and proposed the best suitable crop for the next rotation. Sugarcane
    yield was forecasted by Suresh and Krishna Priya [86] after developing a statistical
    method for predicting the considerable amount of yield. Data in this research,
    which included temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, was collected from
    weather stations. Conclusions of the model were entirely dependent on the condition
    of how precisely the input data was incorporated into model. Interestingly, the
    sugarcane yield was estimated successfully prior to the harvest. Soil moisture
    prediction in Cojocna was carried out by Matei et al. [39], using nine algorithms,
    namely: KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Rule Induction, Decision
    Tree, Fast Large Margin, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The accuracy of
    the results was high, and the findings assisted the farmers to decide and opt
    for the appropriate steps, which helped them to avoid future crop damage. Machine
    learning methods (RF, SVM, NN) and the regression method LASSO (Least Absolute
    Shrinkage and Selection Operator) were used to predict wheat yield based on the
    data obtained from satellite and climatic data by Cai et al. [87] in their research
    work. Additionally, data mining provides a way to analyze nonlinear relationships
    and capture complicated biological processes that underlie plant responses to
    stimuli, both of which are difficult to perform using simple statistics such as
    ANOVA and linear regression. Exploratory data analysis was performed before using
    the abovementioned machine learning methods, and it was concluded that the best
    performance was shown by integrating climate and satellite data. Blagojevic et
    al. [88] studied apricot in a research work where PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)
    method was employed for predicting the yield. An Artificial Neural Network, as
    a machine learning method, was used for the abovementioned predictions that took
    as input: shoot length, fruit weight, shoot thickness, amount of fertilizer, and
    beginning of the harvest. A web application was developed considering the ease
    of displaying the predictions for the yield as a result output. Ravichandran and
    Koteeshwari [89] proposed a prediction system constructed on the ANN (Artificial
    Neural Network). Various parameters were determined by using this approach, namely
    pH, phosphate, potassium, nitrogen, depth, temperature, and precipitation, and
    the output was the adapted culture. This system appeared to be helpful in determining
    the productivity status for the crop. It assisted the farmers to select the best
    and most suitable crop for their land and gave options for the selection of mandatory
    fertilizers. The system manifested 92% accuracy in achieving the forementioned
    objectives. In another study carried out by Cillis et al. [90], several interactions
    were discussed (Table 1). The research work considered the interaction between
    soil–genotype, genotype–climate, climate, and management practices. The findings
    of the study comprehended the organic carbon storage of the soil and specifically
    monitored greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, in order to determine the nutritional
    requirement of strawberries species, MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines)
    has been successfully employed, which has aided in predicting the shoot quality
    as well as determining the leaf color responses of strawberries towards tissue
    culture nutrients [91]. In a similar study, minor nutrient requirements were assessed
    by using regression trees, and it was found that CART (Classification and Regression
    Tree) analysis was the better indicator of the nutrient requirements, such as
    B, Mo, Zn, and CU levels, for a better growth response in hazelnut [92]. The regression
    tree approach is exceptional at handling missing values and outliers. Additionally,
    crop yields were observed by noticing the management approaches and their long-term
    effects. Using the regression analysis approach, it confirmed the diminishing
    of soil organic carbon losses by practicing conservation tillage systems under
    actual climatic conditions. Table 1. Yield prediction and climatic impression
    on overall yields of crops using smart agricultural data mining techniques. 4.
    Smart Irrigation Techniques The water cycle has been substantially altered by
    climate change, which has also increased the severity of droughts [93]. Hence,
    efficient water use in agricultural systems is a basic concern in the current
    scenario. The losses of water under limited water availability have gained a lot
    of interest in these days, when a major part of the world is susceptible to drought
    each year. Traditional and manual irrigation systems fail to accomplish water-saving
    goals, and are unable to supply water efficiently [22]. Smart irrigation is a
    technique which is countering this problem efficiently by not just providing efficient
    water use, but also saving it for the future [94]. Additionally, smart irrigation
    reduces the input costs, which provides relief to the farmers [95]. Manual irrigation
    requires manpower for daily observations and scheduling irrigations by observing
    plants or crops in fields, but a sensor-assisted irrigation system detects soil
    moisture available in the soil profile and initiates the irrigation, making irrigation
    control better than the manual [96], whereas a decision-support-system-assisted
    irrigation system integrates soil moisture sensors and climate sensors to observe
    water demand and control irrigation application for crops (Figure 5). The development
    of accurate and effective irrigation systems has been aided by the revolution
    in decision-support-assisted irrigation systems, brought about by advancements
    in technology [97]. This not only incorporated soil moisture and climate sensors,
    but also an internet-assisted cloud system for real-time data observation. Dynamic
    simulation models are linked to examine the effects of irrigation on crop growth
    and productivity estimation. Moreover, in accordance with data analysis and yield
    predictions, an irrigation quantity has been finalized and is supplied through
    an automatic irrigation control system. A remote control or mobile application
    [98] is also linked up with this system for easy understanding and usage of the
    modern irrigation hub. A scheme of an advanced irrigation hub is presented as
    of Figure 6. Figure 5. Manual versus smart-sensor-based and decision-support-system-assisted
    irrigation applications. Figure 6. Advanced irrigation hub assisted with real
    time weather and moisture sensors and decision support systems. Smart irrigation
    consists of various steps and schemes, which are illustrated in Figure 7, which,
    in combination, make this technique a revolution in agricultural production systems.
    Various techniques were developed and utilized to achieve efficient irrigation
    goals in smart agriculture systems. Automatic drip, sprinkler, real-time moisture-sensor-assisted,
    and predictive irrigation schemes are commonly being utilized [99]. Various advanced
    irrigation techniques haven been developed and improved with time, and some of
    those are indicated in Table 2 with their methods of data usage and objectives.
    Padalalu et al. [37] presented a control system for an automatic irrigation, aiming
    to record and control the irrigation needs of the crop. Several variables, such
    as humidity, soil temperature, and pH, were observed by installing sensors. Additionally,
    a Naive Bayes algorithm was applied to estimate the exact water demand of the
    crop. Weather forecasts were observed to monitor the quantity of applied water
    to crops and the model of this intelligent irrigation system assured the intuitive
    use of water. An irrigation system based on the Support Vector Regression method
    was developed and proposed by Xie et al. [100]. The system was composed of an
    irrigation demand estimation component to evaluate the energy and time needed
    for carrying out the subsequent operations. It was also composed of a solar energy
    prediction component for forecasting the solar energy. Figure 7. Flow diagram
    of various components and processes of smart irrigation systems. Numerical Weather
    Prediction (NWP) and the Time of Use price model (TOU) were employed, which exhibited
    clearly that the water resources and the amount of energy can be saved was up
    to 7.97%. Following the forementioned findings, costs declined by an estimated
    25.34% when subjected to a comparison with the soil-moisture-based irrigation
    system. To maximize crop yields and to conserve an excess of water, Goumopoulos
    et al. [101] devised a decision support system based on a Wireless Sensor/Actuator
    Network (WSAN). The system was positioned to observe irrigation in a greenhouse.
    Real-time monitoring for precision irrigation was provided by the developed system
    in it. Various sensors were considered, such as soil moisture sensors, humidity
    sensors, and temperature sensors, in strawberry field. The results from this research
    depicted a 20% decreased water consumption as compared to a traditional irrigation
    system. In another study, Zhang et al. [102] performed experiments in the laboratory
    and in the greenhouses. A Fuzzy Logic-based irrigation control system was developed,
    and information was gathered from soil moisture sensors to decide the irrigation
    application time. The system came out to be a successful one in tackling the uncontrolled
    lengthy irrigation schedules. Peng et al. [103] developed an irrigation system
    using WSN and Fuzzy Logic to save water. The system was composed of four parts:
    the cluster of sensor nodes, coordinator nodes, two variables as inputs (soil
    moisture error and the rate of change of the error), which provided watering time
    as an output. An irrigation controller was also used for automatic watering and
    monitoring of the pipe network, which eventually helped in precise and quick calculation
    of amount of water required in irrigation. An automatic irrigation system was
    developed by Anand and Perinbam [104] that consisted of four different parts.
    The first part was sensor nodes, which were collecting the temperature and moisture
    readings. The coordinator node, as a second part, the irrigation controller, as
    a third one, which was based on Fuzzy Logic to monitor the watering and the time
    of its application, and the irrigation pipe network, as the last component of
    their proposed system. The Fuzzy Logic-based controller was accounting for numerous
    activities in the automatic irrigation system. One such use was monitoring the
    water level in the tank. Likewise, it was also responsible for examining the amount
    of rain, the atmospheric temperature, and the wind speed. All the information
    which was under investigation, whether the field condition or the system itself,
    was collected and made available for the farmer through the GSM Module [105].
    The Fuzzy Inference System, another smart irrigation system for monitoring the
    evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation, was developed by Mousa et al. [106]. Goals
    were accomplished by using the specific algorithms such as the estimation of ET,
    soil moisture observations, required irrigation’s estimation as per reference
    ET (ET0), monitoring irrigation schedule, and the time of irrigation. Drip and
    sprinkler irrigation systems can be linked and applied successfully using this
    system. Moreover, results indicated the fuzzy model as an intelligent and quick
    implementation for recording the evapotranspiration and water needs of the crop
    field. Table 2. Techniques to achieve efficient irrigation goals in smart agriculture
    systems. 5. Smart Monitoring of Insects and Pests In modern agriculture production
    systems, modern techniques are being utilized for smart monitoring and control
    of insects and pests. To spot six parasites in an apple orchard, Boniecki et al.
    [107] suggested a neural classifier. The names of the parasites were apple blossom
    weevil, apple clearwing, codling moth, apple leaf sucker, apple aphid, and apple
    moth. The abovementioned classifier was established on 23 parameters, which included
    form and color characteristics. The former was 7 and latter was 16 in number.
    Decisive results were obtained by considering the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural
    Network topology in the peach orchard. Rodrigues et al. [108] used an extension
    of Fuzzy Logic, named Interval Fuzzy Logic, to predict the appearance of the parasites.
    Data was captured using temperature and humidity sensors, and processed by Interval
    Fuzzy Logic, which ultimately provided the warning levels. Different hardware
    components, such as the Arduino platform and different sensors, were used to develop
    this system. A demonstration of a drone-assisted evaluation of insects and pests
    in enabling the timely implementation of actions to remove the high-risk infestations
    is presented in Figure 8. In addition, AgroDSS for agriculture, a new decision
    support system, was developed to learn the pest population by Rupnik et al. [109].
    This system relied on data mining approaches, and the implemented tools used were
    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and time series analysis. The data
    was gathered by Trap View and allowed an efficient pest observation by using insect
    traps in the vineyards and orchard. When it came to deal with the missing data,
    linear regression was used by Da Silva et al. [110], who also applied logistic
    regression while inspecting the results obtained from the land and the monthly
    surface temperature. They calculated “accumulated degree-day” by using a meteorological
    satellite to reduce disease risks by mapping the pests. A significant relationship
    was observed between the accumulated meteorological stations values and satellite
    values. Figure 8. Evaluation of pests and encountering remedies in smart farming.
    The crops lines algorithm, in association with the Convolutional Neural Network,
    was proposed by Bah et al. [111]. The aim was to pin down weeds in various crops,
    such as beet, spinach, and bean fields. The research work was also assisted by
    the drone images, which were taken about 20 m height. The best accuracy in results
    were achieved in beet field. However, the research work also mentioned a few hardships
    concerning the right detection of the weeds. This usually happened when the plants
    were at early growth stage or when there was a less distance between weeds and
    crop. Various techniques for smart pest monitoring and its related goals are described
    in Table 3. For an early alert and recommending necessary control measures, Tripathy
    et al. [112] presented a real-time Decision Support System. The main objective
    was observing and predicting the pest and disease status in the field. Furthermore,
    numerous DM techniques have been used in groundnut crops, which were based on
    some climatic and weather parameters. The experiment was using the Naive Bayes
    method with Gaussian distribution. Rapid Association Rule Mining, in conjunction
    with the aforementioned technique, was performed to search out the multiple weather
    correlations with other related parameters. Doses of pesticides are an important
    indicator for the betterment of the crop, and they were predicted by Viani et
    al. [113] by using Fuzzy Logic. Weather data (soil temperature and moisture) were
    considered, and the risk of infection was counted by examining developmental stages
    of the plant and the fluctuating environmental conditions. By combining hydroponics
    with IoT, Alipio et al. [114] developed an efficient hydroponic system, which
    assisted in providing the right nutrient’s type and amount at the best suitable
    time. A Bayesian Network (BN) prediction algorithm was implemented to obtain the
    maximum of the right decisions to control the system. The three main components
    of the developed system were a data analysis module, a web interface, and sensors.
    The sensors used were controlling the electrical conductivity, managing pH, monitoring
    light intensity, recording humidity, and water temperature. For displaying the
    data and to control the system, there were two operational websites for this purpose.
    A clear increase in the yield obtained with the automatic control was observed
    as compared to the manual control system. Table 3. Techniques and goals for monitoring
    pests and input management in smart agriculture. 6. Smart Disease Management Diseases
    in crops are devastating in terms of yield and deteriorating the quality of the
    produce. Numerous solutions are out there in the market and industries [115,116],
    yet there is a need to think or perform smarter, to remove the excessive damage
    to the final product, and to enhance the outcome in terms of the revenue. In smart
    agriculture, the focus is on the classification of the diseases and its detection
    precisely at any stage [117], so that smart decision making can be conducted and
    the excessive failure in the yield and quality can be avoided. A modified model
    image of smart disease management using normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), drone, and imaging techniques is presented in Figure 9. Singh et al. [118]
    opted for the image processing technique using a genetic algorithm. In his research
    work, he observed and managed several leaf diseases on various crops, achieving
    the precision percentage of 88.99%. Likewise, 89.56% precision was achieved by
    Warne and Ganorkar [119] while detecting the leaf diseases in cotton crop. They
    classified the diseases as red leaf spot and Alternaria leaf spot of cotton using
    a neural network algorithm. Similar research was performed by Revathi and Hemalatha
    [120] while working on a cotton crop. Image processing was assisted by the neural
    network to detect and classify cotton diseases. In this research work, they classified
    Fusarium wilt and leaf blight with the high precision of 98.1%. Image processing
    by employing Support Vector Machine was performed by Bhange and Hingoliwala [121],
    Yao et al. [122], Jian and Wei [123], and Dubey and Jalal [124] to target teyla
    in pomegranate, rice blast and rice sheath blight in rice, downy mildew and brown
    spot in cucumber, and apple rot, scab, and blotch in apple. The results from these
    research studies have indicated the precision percentages as high as 82%, 97.2%,
    94% and 93%, respectively, as represented in Table 4. Figure 9. Smart disease
    management by using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), drone and imaging
    techniques. Modified figure where the drone mapping image on the top right was
    obtained from: https://www.futurefarming.com/tech-in-focus/pain-points-of-nitrogen-applications-how-drone-data-helps/,
    accessed on 14 June 2022. Table 4. Methods and precision percentage for detecting
    and classifying diseases in smart agriculture. 7. Smart Indoor Farming/Vertical
    Farming The amount of agricultural land has decreased as a result of the persistent
    trends of population growth, urbanization, water supply reduction, and ongoing
    climate change [125]. Numerous variables, including the rise in food prices, social
    tensions and land disputes, the severity of persevering climate change, and increased
    urbanization, contribute to the absence of effective planning for food security
    and sustainability. Contrary to old farming systems, a controlled, automated vertical
    farming model was introduced, which is an indoor based farm model constituting
    of an automatic air, temperature, and humidity control, solar panel lighting and
    heating, tunable 24 h LED illumination, and creative uses of recycled water supplemented
    by rainwater or water from a desalination facility [126]. The impacts of seasonality
    can be reduced or completely eliminated when performed in conjunction with temperature
    and humidity control. Two categories of this farming system have been used: those
    where the crop is produced on a vertical surface, and those that have several
    tiers of conventional horizontal growth platforms [127]. Leafy vegetables such
    as lettuce, peppers, tomatoes, and herbs have all been cultivated extensively
    in horizontal systems, which are sometimes stacked on top of one another to form
    vertical farms. These horizontal and stacked horizontal agricultural technologies
    make use of numerous glasshouses and plant factories [128]. Occasionally, for
    personal production, the use of balconies as an alternative to indoor horizontal
    farming has also been proven as an effective urban horticultural practice. For
    vertical farming, green walls [129] and cylindrical growth units [130] have been
    in practice, the former operated in facades of the buildings, while in the latter
    one, plants are connected with a nutrient medium source and are grown one above
    another. These farming systems are often assisted by an artificial lighting system
    to meet the adequate requirement of photosynthetic active radiation for a better
    growth and yield [131]. The carotenoids accumulation has been known to be increased
    by 15% in Brassica rapa under a blue and white LED recipe compared to only white
    LED [132]. Red LEDs alone are responsible for enhancing biomass accumulation,
    green LEDs for carbon assimilation, and blue LEDs are mainly helpful in photosynthetic
    processes in plants [133]. All these available LEDs not only provide better growth
    and development, but also cheaper and more reliable artificial lighting options
    compared to the high-pressure sodium (HPS), fluorescent tubes, and metal halides
    (MH) lights. 8. Major Obstacles for Implementation of IoT and Smart Techniques
    Smart farming and IoT are considered as a blessing to the agricultural sector,
    yet it brought a series of various challenges to agriculturists, and farmers in
    particular [134,135]. If not overcome or addressed timely, those hurdles can reduce
    the feasibility and effectivity of this technology. Over time, numerous constraints
    have been reported [103,136] and efforts are being made to resolve the limitations
    [137,138]. Among the major problems to be remitted, one is the security of the
    big data [139,140,141]. IoT devices accumulate huge data from an agricultural
    IoT system, which can be viewed by an unauthorized access due to the paucity of
    the necessary security protocols by some of the IoT providers [142,143]. Hence,
    the data may suffer manipulation or other ownership problems. Another big problem
    is the lack of infrastructure for this technology. Infrastructure concerning internet
    access and remote field locations are the main issues for farmers who, even after
    adopting this technology, cannot achieve the maximum output. High costs of IoT
    systems are another hurdle which is being addressed by making available less costly
    wireless sensors in the market [144]. Still, a lot is in needed to minimize the
    costs of the whole system [145], after which one can expect that farmers will
    switch to IoT and smart farming. Moreover, the majority of the farmers in various
    parts of the world are uneducated [146]. Smart farming and IoT demands a fair
    amount of knowledge to deal with the sensors, internet cloud, and end user applications
    [147]. Additionally, various countries pose a series of regulations and paperwork
    for the farmers who are willing to adopt new technologies. These tiresome regulations
    are another factor which is keeping farmers away from it. For example, there are
    numerous no fly zones for the drones in the agricultural fields near to airports,
    military zones, and other government properties [148,149]. Hence drone mapping
    is not feasible for those fields and farmers. Meanwhile, agricultural digitalization
    is engulfing a huge employment opportunity for the laborers and other farming-related
    professionals. On one hand, it is better for reducing the labor input and cost
    for the owner, but on the other hand, is depriving local workers of multiple job
    opportunities [150]. Keeping these constraints in mind, there arises an important
    question: Will this technology thrive more in the coming years? 9. Conclusions
    and Future Guidelines The study provided a summary of the inventive strategies
    created and applied to combat the effects of climate change and maintaining a
    sustainable crop output. The recent smart strategies for various crop management
    approaches, as well as the technologies associated with yield predictions and
    enhancements, are explained. It has been shown that implementation of smart techniques
    and IoT is necessary to boost the productivity of crop production systems. It
    was found that various neural networks and simulation models could aid in yield
    prediction for better decision support, with an average simulation accuracy up
    to 92%. Numerous techniques have been presented for yield forecasting, pest management,
    smart irrigation, and disease classification and detection for efficient monitoring
    of crop health and water status. Different numerical models and smart irrigation
    tools help to save energy use by reducing it up to 8%, whereas advanced irrigation
    reduced the cost by 25.34% as compared to soil moisture-based irrigation system.
    Yield prediction under different predicted climatic conditions not only help to
    modify ongoing irrigation and fertilizer management practices, but ultimately
    lead to resource use efficiency and profitable agricultural productivity. Smart
    and precision disease management is an effective approach to control diseases
    and sustain yields. Several leaf diseases on various crops can be managed by using
    image processing techniques, such as by using a genetic algorithm with 90% precision
    accuracy. While aiding image processing techniques by neural networks, diseases
    can be detected and classified, and the research achieved precision up to 98%
    in detecting and classifying diseases in different crops. Vertical farming and
    its various methods of indoor production has been discussed in order to understand
    its impact on global food production, especially as an option to eradicate or
    minimize the effects of urbanization over global food productivity. The use of
    artificial lighting with a purpose of providing an effective photosynthetic photon
    flux density has been discussed for better growth and development of various horticultural
    produce. Moreover, the current review discussed the various effective tactics,
    important techniques, IoT-based smart technologies, and the application of sensors,
    in addition to the constraints that exist worldwide as restrictions to adopting
    these smart technologies in agriculture. Future work will go on to explain the
    new emerging challenges and constraints, to accept and adopt the modern advancements
    for smart farming. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.A. and T.H.; methodology,

  description: 'Timely and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential
    for precise irrigation management at the farm scale. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    remote sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method
    for SMC monitoring. Many existing SMC models have only been tested at a specific
    crop growth stage using a single type of sensor, and the effects of growth stage
    and irrigation variation on SMC estimation accuracy remain unclear. To address
    these limitations, this study used UAV-based multimodal data to quantify SMC in
    a maize field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine

    Get rights and content Highlights • The potential of low-cost UAV-based multi-sensor
    data for maize SMC prediction was evaluated. • Three machine learning algorithms
    were tested to choose the best method for SMC estimation. • Mild to modest deficit
    irrigation treatments are more conducive to soil moisture monitoring. • RFR provide
    promising results across growing seasons, stages, and water status. Abstract Timely
    and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential for precise
    irrigation management at the farm scale. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote
    sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method for
    SMC monitoring. Many existing SMC models have only been tested at a specific crop
    growth stage using a single type of sensor, and the effects of growth stage and
    irrigation variation on SMC estimation accuracy remain unclear. To address these
    limitations, this study used UAV-based multimodal data to quantify SMC in a maize
    field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine learning
    algorithms (MLA): partial least squares regression (PLSR), K nearest neighbor
    (KNN), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrated that multimodal
    data fusion improves the SMC estimation accuracy regardless of the MLA, especially
    the joint use of thermal and multispectral data. Among three SMC regression models,
    the RFR model produced the most accurate SMC estimation for the two growing seasons
    regardless of sensor combinations. The RFR model using all three types of data
    generated the most accurate and robust SMC estimation at the vegetative stage
    with R2 of 0.68 and 0.78, and rRMSE of 20.82% and 19.36% for 10- and 20-cm soil
    depths, respectively; it also produced the best SMC estimation accuracy under
    well-watered and mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments for both soil depths.
    The study shows that the high spatial–temporal maps of SMC using UAV-based multimodal
    data has promising potential for supporting decision-making in irrigation scheduling

    stagesDeficit irrigation 1. Introduction Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an
    important role in agricultural, meteorological, climatological, and hydrological
    applications. A proper decision for precision irrigation is facilitated by accurate
    information about the SMC at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale. It is
    difficult to obtain spatially continuous observations using conventional in-situ
    methods of SMC measurement, such as the drying method (O’Kelly and Sivakumar,
    2014), time domain reflectometry (Robinson et al., 2003), neutron probe measurements
    (Evett and Steiner, 1995), and heat pulse measurements (Agliata et al., 2019),
    owing to discrete sampling points and high cost (Guo et al., 2022). With significant
    advances in remote sensing technology, satellite data have been widely applied
    to SMC estimation, particularly the optical (Serrano et al., 2019), thermal (Sohrabinia
    et al., 2014), and microwave (Chen et al., 2018) observations. Nevertheless, the
    application of satellite data for SMC estimation is limited by the low resolution
    and near-surface depth of the measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology
    provides high spatio-temporal resolution data for estimating SMC (Hill et al.,
    2017). Several studies have successfully used UAV-based optical remote sensing
    for SMC estimation, mainly in the near-infrared and visible bands, to establish
    vegetation indices (VIs) (Kogan, 1990, Ge et al., 2021). Moreover, UAV-based thermal
    remote sensing has been shown to accurately predict farmland moisture (Li et al.,
    2022). Recent studies have shown that integrating multi-source remote sensing
    data can be effectively used for SMC estimation. For example, Wigmore et al. (2019)
    used multispectral (MS) and thermal (TIR) data from UAV remote sensing to calculate
    the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), which was applied to predict
    surface SMC within mountain environments and obtained results with R2 = 0.55–0.76.
    Cheng et al. (2022) combined UAV-based multimodal data to estimate the SMC under
    high maize canopy coverage and obtained results with R2 = 0.78. Guo et al. (2022)
    combined microwave remote sensing and UAV multispectral remote sensing to monitor
    SMC in a winter wheat planting area and obtained results with R2 = 0.92. Nevertheless,
    microwaves cannot penetrate dense fields with tall plants such as maize. Therefore,
    UAV-based optical and thermal sensing has been widely used in current research
    on SMC estimations (Cheng et al., 2022). Because of the correlation between vegetation
    spectrum and SMC under agricultural crops, various parametric and non-parametric
    regression models have been implemented to monitor SMC (e.g., machine learning
    algorithms (MLA)) (Chen et al., 2021, Döpper et al., 2022). To improve the performance
    of SMC estimation in saline soils, partial least squares regression (PLSR) with
    thermal infrared data was used to build the SMC prediction model (Xu and Wang,
    2015). Ge et al. (2019) applied the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm to
    predict the SMC in winter wheat using UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. Consequently,
    choosing a proper regression algorithm is essential for achieving accurate SMC
    predictions for dense vegetation. Generally, most approaches to estimating SMC
    using a combination of UAV remote sensing and MLA have been applied at a specific
    growth stage or a single growth day (Cheng et al., 2022, Guo et al., 2022). However,
    the dynamics of VIs and SMC continuously change over time. Additionally, one SMC
    value may correspond to multiple VIs and thus may affect the performance of the
    SMC estimation. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted
    to monitor SMC using UAV remote sensing and MLA during the entire crop-growing
    season. Furthermore, SMC estimation models were only tested and trained for one
    year, and several samples (Seo et al., 2021). Crops are susceptible to changes
    in SMC and spectral reflectance of maize canopy varies with growth stage and soil
    water content. Although UAV remote sensing has been applied to SMC prediction
    at arid and semi-arid sites (Babaeian et al., 2021), the irrigation regimes are
    the same; therefore, verification of SMC is limited. Few studies have focused
    on different water treatments for crops. Thus, the performance of SMC estimation
    using VIs and MLA at different growth stages of crops under different water treatments
    is still unclear. Based on the above analysis, this study used the SMC under the
    maize planting area as the research object and acquired RGB, MS, and TIR data
    at different growth stages of maize under different irrigation treatments for
    cross-year SMC estimation. The specific objectives were to 1) compare the potential
    of UAV multiple types of sensors in the SMC prediction model by MLA during the
    whole growing season, and determine an optimal model, 2) evaluate the robustness
    of SMC estimation using the optimal model for different irrigation treatments,
    and3) examine the performance of SMC estimation using the optimal model at different
    growth stages. 2. Material 2.1. Field site description The field site was located
    in Ordos, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The climate is semi-arid, with
    an elevation of 1010 m. Maize (cv. ‘Junkai 918’) was planted in May, tasseled
    in July, and harvested for silage in September 2018 and 2019. The soil type was
    loamy sand (80.7 % sand, 13.7 % powder, and 5.6 % clay) with a field capacity
    of 20.3 % and a soil bulk density of 1.56 g cm−3. The row and planting spacing
    were 0.58 m and 0.25 m in 2018, and 0.40 m and 0.25 m in 2019. The entire field
    was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Nebraska, USA) and divided into five regions with different irrigation treatments
    throughout the growing seasons (May to September) of 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 1a).
    Each irrigation treatment included three replicated individual plots (6 m × 6
    m) (Fig. 1b). Deficit irrigation was applied independently during the vegetative
    (V), reproductive (R) and maturation (M) stages. The treatment was named based
    on the target percentage of evapotranspiration of non-stressed crops during each
    growth stage. For example, a treatment (40/100/80) indicated the treatment received
    irrigation of 40 %, 100 %, and 80 % of maximum evapotranspiration during the V,
    R, and M growth stages, respectively. Here we use TR1-TR5 to represent treatments
    at five different irrigation levels (from maximum to minimum irrigation amounts),
    respectively (Table 1). The amount of irrigation and precipitation (Table 1) were
    measured using a flowmeter and rain gauge cylinders with three replications. Download

    Field measurements A soil auger was used to collect soil samples which were then
    used to measure gravimetric SMC (SMCg) at depths of 10 and 20 cm. To ensure accurate
    measurements, each plot was divided into 30 equal subplots. Each time, three subplots
    were randomly selected among the 30 subplots to measure SMC data to avoid repetition,
    as shown in Fig. 2. The average of the three measurements was the in-situ measured
    SMC for a given plot. SMC measurements were performed after the UAV flight campaign
    in the field. A total of 300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected
    from 2018 to 2019. The volumetric soil moisture content (SMC, cm3cm−3) was calculated
    as follows: (1) Where ρ represents soil bulk density (g cm−3). Undisturbed soil
    samples at 0–20 cm were collected using a cutting ring (diameter, 5 cm; height,
    5 cm). The samples were then dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 ℃. The
    measured weight was converted into standard units (g cm−3). For example, the measured
    soil moisture at two soil depths along with the rainfall/irrigation in 2018 TR1
    were shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download : Download

    (DJI, Shenzhen, China) platform was developed to carry UAV high-resolution RGB
    (DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China), MS RedEdge (MicaSense Inc., USA), and TIR
    (FLIR Systems, USA) sensors (Fig. 4). The details of each camera are listed in
    Table 2. The UAV was used to capture images between 11:00 and 14:00 under low
    wind speeds and clear sky conditions during the entire maize growing season in
    2018 (10 d) and 2019 (10 d) (Table 3). The flight heights were set at 70 m and
    the flight path resulted in 85 % front and side overlap. The spatial resolutions
    of RGB, MS and TIR images were 3, 5, and 9 cm, respectively. During the UAV flights,
    a MicaSense (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) calibrated reflectance panel and the
    temperatures of ground objects (e.g., black and white cotton fabric pieces, wet/dry
    soil, crop canopy, water, etc.) collected simultaneously were used for radiometric
    correction of the MS and TIR imagery, respectively. Six ground control points
    (GCPs) were placed for georeferencing imagery from UAV multi-sensors. Download

    were preprocessed into orthomosaic maps using the Pix4Dmapper software (Pix4DInc.,
    Lausanne, Switzerland). The digital numbers of the raw multispectral images were
    later converted to reflectance values. During post-processing, the parameters
    of the thermal images were adjusted according to the environmental conditions,
    such as air temperature and humidity, to conduct radiometric conversion. The ground-measured
    temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures from the UAV thermal
    imagery, which were converted using a linear model (Fig. 5). Download : Download

    are listed in Table 4 and in the subsequent sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.3. To relate
    different types of data with corresponding soil moisture content, the average

    3.2.1. RGB features Fractional vegetation cover (FVC), the proportion of green
    vegetation on the ground surface, was extracted from the RGB imagery using the
    Otsu (maximum between-class variance) method (Otsu, 1979, Zhang et al., 2019).
    The classified maize pixels were divided by the total pixels for a given plot,
    and the formula for the FVC calculation is presented as follows: (2) In addition,
    the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) (Haralick et al., 1973) was employed
    to extract texture features from the RGB in this study and then used as input
    data for SMC prediction. The GLCM-based texture information, that is, variance
    (VA), contrast (CO), entropy (EN), correlation (COR), mean (ME), homogeneity (HO),
    dissimilarity (DS), and second moment (SM), was computed using the ENVI 5.3 software
    (Table 4). 3.2.2. Multispectral features A set of UAV-based VIs, previously used
    to estimate the SMC, was extracted from the raw spectral bands and is listed in
    Table 4. Additionally, GLCM was extracted from the NIR and red edge bands using
    the same methods as described above. 3.2.3. Thermal features Normalized relative
    canopy temperature (NRCT) was derived from UAV thermal infrared imagery. The NRCT
    was used to assess crop water status (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). The detailed
    formula for NRCT is as follows: (3) where Ti represents the UAV-based temperature
    of the i-th pixel and Tmin (Tmax) represents the lowest (highest) UAV-based temperature
    in the entire field. Moreover, we applied the TVDI to predict SMC, which is based
    on the simplified surface temperature-vegetation index (Ts-NDVI) space method
    (Fig. 5) and has been commonly implemented to characterize water status and SMC
    (Sandholt et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2008). TVDI is calculated as follows: (4)
    (6) where Tsmax (Tsmin) is the highest (lowest) Ts observation and adry, awet
    bdry, and bwet are the intercept and slope of the dry (wet) edge (Fig. 6), respectively.

    from the thermal-based NRCT using the methods described in Section 3.2.1 and Section
    3.2.2. 3.3. Soil moisture content prediction model 3.3.1. Modeling methods All
    the input features in Table 4 were extracted for the 15 sampling plots (Fig. 1,
    Fig. 2) and then matched to the in situ measured SMC of each plot. A total of
    300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected during the UAV flights
    from 2018 to 2019 and used for training and testing the performance of the model
    developed in this study. SMC estimation models were developed using MLA: PLSR
    (Rischbeck et al., 2016), K nearest neighbor (KNN) (Shahabul Alam and Elshorbagy,
    2015), and RFR (Cheng et al., 2022). The RFR algorithm for SMC estimation was
    compared with the PLSR and KNN algorithms to select an optimal SMC prediction
    method. The MLA was implemented using Python with the Scikit-learn library. For
    a fair and uniform comparison of machine learning methods, 80 % of randomly selected
    input features and SMC data (240 SMC measurements) were used as training samples,
    and the remaining 20 % (60 SMC measurements) were used as unseen samples to test
    the performance of the prediction algorithms. 3.3.2. Validation methods The accuracy
    of the SMC estimation algorithms was verified by fivefold cross-validation; therefore,
    240 SMC measurements were used independently for model validation. Then, the average
    accuracy was obtained. The model performance was evaluated using the coefficient
    of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root-mean-square
    error (rRMSE). The detailed workflow, from feature extraction to model building
    and validation, is shown in Fig. 7. First, different features were extracted from
    three types of imagery, such as FVC, GLCM, and vegetation indices. Then, three
    machine learning methods with the above features as inputs were used to establish
    SMC prediction models and the measured SMC data were used for model training and
    testing. Finally, the applicability of the SMC prediction models under different
    growth stages (V, R, and M) and irrigation levels (TR1–TR5) was analyzed. Download

    Workflow of multimodal data extraction and modeling. 4. Results 4.1. Estimation
    accuracy of soil moisture content As shown in Table 5, generally, RFR exhibited
    the highest estimation accuracy compared to PLSR and KNN, with R2 ranging from
    0.42 to 0.61 for 10-cm soil depth, and 0.41 to 0.65 for 20-cm soil depth, respectively.
    The best SMC prediction was observed in the case of using the combination of RGB,
    MS, and TIR data, with R2 = 0.61 and 0.65, RMSE = 1.9 % and 2.1 %, as well as
    rRMSE = 23.4 % and 26.3 % for 10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. When using
    data from a single sensor, the multispectral sensor produced better accuracy in
    SMC prediction than the thermal and RGB sensors did. Table 5. Validation of different

    The best result in terms of R2, RMSE and RMSE% values through different sensors
    with various modeling methods are boldfaced. Generally, all MLA produced a gradually
    increasing R2 and a decreasing rRMSE with an increasing number of sensors (Table
    5). This is because all the methods can effectively fuse information from multimodal
    data. The accuracy of the SMC estimation model based on MS sensors, a combination
    of MS and RGB sensors, or a combination of RGB and TIR sensors was similar at
    both soil depths (R2 = 0.3–0.57, rRMSE = 25.3–34.8 %). The joint use of TIR and
    MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.41–0.64), making it more suitable
    for SMC prediction (Table 5). However, the combination of RGB and TIR data had
    a relatively higher accuracy, regardless of the MLA (Table 5). The inclusion of
    RGB data in the combination of MS and TIR data slightly increased the estimation
    accuracy, With PLSR, R2 increased only by 0.02 for 10-cm soil depth while using
    KNN, R2 increased by 0.08 for 20-cm soil depth. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show the observed
    and estimated SMC using the RFR for various combinations of UAV data for both
    10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. The estimation result of the 20-cm soil
    depth was slightly better than that of the 10-cm soil depth regardless of the
    combination of sensors, indicating that the estimation accuracy of SMC was similar
    at the two depths during the entire growth period. Download : Download high-res

    shows the performance of the RFR model at V, R, and M stages. The SMC at the V
    stage was the most accurate estimation in both 2018 and 2019, regardless of the
    soil depth. For the 10-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.68 and
    20.82 %; for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.78 and
    19.36 %, respectively. At the R stage, the RFR model exhibited the poorest performance,
    with an R2 of 0.37. Moreover, the SMC estimation accuracies at each stage for
    the two depths were similar and comparable. Among them, the estimation model overestimated
    under low SMC and underestimated under high SMC in both years. Therefore, the
    differences in irrigation amount and meteorological conditions, especially precipitation,
    may decrease the accuracy of SMC estimation using the RFR model and UAV-based
    multimodal data. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download

    prediction for different water treatments Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show the performance
    of the RFR model across different irrigation treatments. In this study, we divided
    the irrigation treatments into five levels (TR1-TR5 from high to low). The optimal
    estimation using the RFR algorithm was achieved for TR1 with R2 and rRMSE of 0.65
    and 21.33 % at 10-cm soil depth, and R2 and rRMSE of 0.76 and 18.61 % at 20-cm
    soil depth, respectively. This indicates that the RFR model based on UAV-based
    multimodal data can provide a comparable estimation of SMC for different soil
    depths throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. Furthermore, the accuracy
    of the SMC prediction model under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment (TR5)
    was relatively low (R2 = 0.35–0.41, rRMSE = 21.22 %–33.26 %) compared to TR2–TR4
    irrigation levels. It can be inferred that the RFR model utilizing multimodal
    information is more applicable to mild water stress treatments. Generally, the
    rRMSE for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation had an average value of 25.40 %, which
    was slightly greater than the corresponding value of 24.38 % for the 10-cm depth
    SMC estimation. At a depth of 10 cm, the SMC estimation had an R2 = 0.41–0.65
    with an average value of 0.53, and at 20 cm depth, R2 = 0.35–0.76 with a mean
    value of 0.56. Therefore, the SMC estimation exhibited similar performance at
    both depths. Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download full-size

    irrigation treatments when irrigation regimes were different, especially for the
    10-cm depth SMC maps on 23 Aug 2018 (the average of TR1 = 11.39 % and TR5 = 9.33
    %) and 20-cm depth SMC map on 26 Jul 2019 (the average of TR1 = 12.21 %, TR2 =
    10.35 %, and TR5 = 9.24 %). Meanwhile, the SMC values for the different treatments
    were similar when irrigation regimes were the same, for example, the 10-cm depth
    SMC on 26 Jul 2018 (the average of TR1–TR5 = 10.35 %–10.77 %). Generally, the
    RFR model with the fusion of RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used to characterize
    the spatial distribution of the SMC, which provides a reference for precision
    irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several studies have already shown that UAV remote sensing can be effectively
    employed to predict SMC at a farmland scale (Table 6), but most experiments had
    only focused on a single day or specific growth stage in the growing season (Cheng
    et al., 2022, Ge et al., 2021). In this study, UAV-based multimodal data were
    used to build an SMC prediction model throughout the growing season. The fusion
    of multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR) produced the best accuracy regardless of
    the modeling method, with significant accuracy of approximately 2 % RMSE. These
    results agree with those of previous studies, such as Cheng et al. (2022), who
    also found that texture, temperature, and spectral information offered unique
    and complementary information conducive to SMC prediction. The joint use of TIR
    and MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy, making it more suitable for SMC
    prediction (Table 5). This may be because the thermal-based temperature data can
    solve asymptotic saturation problems of MS data at maturity stages (Rischbeck
    et al., 2016). However, the inclusion of RGB data in the MS data slightly improved
    the estimation accuracy of the PLSR, KNN and RFR algorithms. These results indicate
    that the MS and RGB data exhibit information overlap and homogeneity (Pelizari
    et al., 2018). Because of its indirect linkage with soil moisture under vegetation
    conditions, optical and thermal observations are suitable for fitting nonlinear
    models to retrieve soil moisture, particularly MLA (Ge et al., 2019, Guan et al.,
    2022). Consequently, we tested three MLA to estimate the SMC throughout the growing
    season for two years. The results showed that the RFR model is more robust for
    multiple sensors at both 10- and 20-cm depths, compared to the other MLA (Table
    5 and Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Consistent with previous research, the RFR method can overcome
    redundant information and overfitting (Chen et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2018). Table

    2022 Owing to vegetation interference, especially in conditions of dense vegetation
    coverage, optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to obtain
    soil status. However, the severe water stress at any crop growth stage of maize
    directly affects crop physiology, growth, and developmental processes (e.g., leaf
    curl and senescence, increased canopy temperature, and decreased chlorophyll content),
    resulting in phenotype, spectral and temperature variations of the canopy (Kullberg
    et al., 2017). The above changes provide a theoretical basis for indirect monitoring
    of soil moisture distribution. In this case, the SMC has generally been estimated
    based on status of vegetation (Zhang and Zhou, 2016, Cheng et al., 2022). Thus,
    this approach bypasses the uncertainty in describing the physical process, which
    makes this method simple and feasible. The RFR-based multimodal model performed
    robustly in the cross-year soil moisture estimation at the V stage for both depths
    (Fig. 10). This is because the growth characteristics (such as canopy structure,
    greenness, and plant water status) that are highly correlated with VIs are sensitive
    to soil moisture at the V stage (Ma et al., 2018). Conversely, the RFR-based multimodal
    method produced a relatively low accuracy in the cross-year SMC estimation at
    the other stages (Fig. 10). This is because high vegetation coverage may lead
    to saturation of the optical sensors (Wallace, 2013), resulting in an overall
    bias in the estimation. Previous studies have shown that UAV thermal imagery can
    be used to detect crop water stress (Zhang et al., 2019) that responds to insufficient
    soil moisture in the root zone (Sampathkumar et al., 2012). However, optical and
    thermal-based indices may be conservative indicators under high vegetation coverage
    and not able to detect the droughts caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies
    immediately. Consequently, the top layer of the soil profile had the greatest
    error in estimating soil moisture at the R stage. The accuracy at the M stage
    was lower than that reported by Cheng et al. (2022) with R2 = 0.78. This difference
    is related to climate, water stress, irrigation method, cultivar, and planting
    density. Further research regarding the impact of climatic and field management
    conditions on SMC predictions should be conducted for different crop species.
    Deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy for maintaining yield while
    reducing agricultural water use (Al-Ghobari and Dewidar, 2018). The results showed
    that the RFR-based multimodal method performed robustly throughout the growing
    season under well-watered and mild to moderate-stressed irrigation treatments,
    indicating that the model built using UAV multimodal data is feasible and effective
    for estimating SMC (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). However, under the full-irrigation treatment,
    there was an underestimation under wet conditions (high SMC) for both years. This
    is because the meteorological conditions and the increase in canopy coverage may
    decrease the SMC estimation accuracy when using multimodal data (Cheng et al.,
    2022). Furthermore, under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment, the SMC was
    overestimated in the low-SMC region for both years. This is because of the VI-saturation
    issue and underestimation of the water stress status (Vergara-Díaz et al., 2016,
    Virnodkar et al., 2020). Additionally, the estimation accuracy of SMC by the RFR-based
    multimodal model at the 20-cm depth was similar to that at the 10-cm depth under
    different irrigation treatments, indicating that the estimation method is effective
    in utilizing multimodal information for both soil depths. The results showed that
    the RFR-based multimodal method outperformed the other regression methods under
    different irrigation treatments across the years. The model using RFR with combined
    RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used for SMC estimation under well-watered and mild
    to moderate deficit irrigation treatments; therefore, this SMC map can be applied
    to design optimal regulated deficit irrigation strategies because maize productivity
    is improved by moderate deficit irrigation (Zou et al., 2021). Meanwhile, in agricultural
    production, farmers are most concerned about soil moisture status in the days
    after irrigation/rainfall. Our study has proven the potential of the RFR-based
    multimodal method to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely evaluating the
    SMC. Further work is suggested to investigate other soil types, which may determine
    the applicability and transferability of the method. However, the high deficit
    irrigation treatment led to low accuracy of the prediction model owing to optical
    saturation issues and redundant datasets. Recently technologies have been used
    to extract related information from UAV-based images for crop yield prediction
    using deep-learning algorithms (Ma et al., 2021). For instance, Maimaitijiang
    et al. (2020) reported that UAV-based multimodal data using deep learning methods
    improved yield prediction model accuracy compared to MLA, such as RFR and PLSR.
    Therefore, further work should investigate the generality of deep learning-based
    methods for SMC estimation. The application of our technique and prediction models
    to other climatological conditions should be investigated further. 6. Conclusions
    The ability of fused multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR data) derived from UAV-based
    multi-sensors for SMC estimation by MLA was investigated under different levels
    of irrigation. The major conclusions are as follows: 1. MS data outperformed RGB
    and TIR data for single sensor-based SMC prediction during the entire growing
    season. The joint use of TIR and MS data showed great potential for SMC prediction
    with higher estimation accuracy. Generally, the combination of all types of sensors
    using the RFR algorithm exhibited the most accurate estimation of the SMC, regardless
    of the modeling method. 2. The RFR method generated the most accurate and robust
    SMC estimations at the vegetative stage, followed by the maturation stage. However,
    they produced less accurate SMC estimation under high vegetation coverage during
    the reproductive stage. Additionally, the RFR method exhibited strong adaptability
    to the two soil depths (10- and 20-cm) with similar prediction accuracy. 3. The
    RFR method produced the best estimation accuracy under well-watered and mild to
    modest deficit irrigated treatments. However, they produced less accurate SMC
    estimation under severe deficit irrigated treatments. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: As today's agriculture industry is facing numerous challenges, including
    climate changes, encroachment of the urban environment, and lack of qualified
    farmers, there is a need for new practices to ensure sustainable agriculture and
    food supply. Consequently, there is an emphasis on upgrading farming practices
    by shifting toward smart farming (SF) - utilizing advanced information and communication
    technologies to improve the quantity and quality of the crop with minimal labor
    interference. SF has gained lots of interest in recent years utilizing a variety
    of technological innovations in the field, which imposes a challenge on farmers
    and technology integrators to identify suitable technologies and best practices
    for a particular application. This article provides a survey of the most recent
    SF scientific literature to identify common practices toward technology integration,
    challenges, and solutions. The survey was conducted on 588 papers published on
    the IEEE database following Cochrane methods to ensure appropriate analysis and
    interpretation of results. The papers' contributions were analyzed to identify
    necessary technologies that constitute SF, and consequently, research themes were
    identified. The identified themes are sensors, communication, big data, actuators
    and machines, and data analysis. Besides presenting an in-depth analysis of each
    identified theme, this article discusses integrating more than one technology
    in systems to achieve independency. The most common SF systems are remote monitoring,

    I. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations, “the world’s population is expected to grow to almost ten billion by
    2050, which requires a 60% increase in global food production” [1]. Meanwhile,
    food security is threatened by the increase in pests and diseases, lack of qualified
    labor, and climate changes [2], [3]. The rise in food demand and the challenges
    faced on the production side motivated the shift from traditional agriculture
    to smart farming (SF). SF refers to incorporating technologies in the field to
    either decrease human involvement or increase the quality and quantity of production
    yield [4]. SF and its literature have experienced an explosion in development
    that includes integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices, advanced actuation systems, and data analytics techniques. The
    increased volume of research literature has made it difficult for individuals
    to assess the vast quantity of work to identify suitable technologies and best
    practices for a particular technology. To this extent, there have been previous
    efforts to provide an overview of different technologies in SF, such as IoT [5],
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19],
    data analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques [14], [18], [20], [21], [22],
    [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], sensor networks [12],
    [17], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], and intelligent actuation systems [39],
    [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. As those papers are technology-oriented, they focus
    exclusively on providing a technical overview of the domain and/or tracking the
    most recent advancements in a field, giving little to no awareness to nonspecialists
    on technology integration guidelines. Other general survey papers focused on identifying
    trends and patterns of research on SF [45], [46], [47] or highlighting the role
    of different technologies in the agricultural industry in a particular region
    [48], [49]. A limitation of previous literature reviews is that they target researchers
    and technology developers rather than farmers and practitioners. The contribution
    of this article is to provide guidance to SF practitioners by surveying the most
    recent scientific literature and analyzing the technology integrated into SF.
    This article examines various integration options for each technology and highlights
    the key challenges faced during technology integration and the proposed solutions.
    The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II presents the
    procedure followed to collect, organize, and analyze the literature. Section III
    shows an in-depth analysis of all technology integrated into SF literature, along
    with their key challenges and solutions. Section IV provide a discussion of systems
    that integrate multiple technologies. SECTION II. Methods This study was designed
    in accordance with the Cochrane reporting methodology for systematic review guidelines.
    The Cochrane protocol was adopted as it guarantees highly structured and transparent
    research outcomes [50]. The methodology entailed identifying the research papers
    included in the survey, preparing the documents for in- depth analysis through
    an initial assessment, and then evaluating and analyzing the literature. A search
    statement that fits a prespecified eligibility/inclusion criterion was applied
    to the IEEE database to find all relevant research papers. The inclusion criteria
    attempt to collate all documents that contribute to studying or applying new technology
    in the field of SF. To meet this criterion, a two-word search statement was used.
    The search statement comprised one word from each of the following sets: [smart,
    precession, intelligent, advanced] and [greenhouse, farming, agriculture]. Truncation
    symbols were used to ensure that plural forms and variant spellings were included
    in the results. The “all fields” option was selected in the search engine to ensure
    inclusiveness. In addition, the publication years were specified to be between
    2015 and 2021. The choice of this particular period is justified by considering
    that SF is a new phenomenon, and the older literature could be misleading in describing
    the current state of the art and research. The search statement was applied to
    the IEEE database to collect papers to be surveyed. The IEEE database was chosen
    for the quality and credibility of its scientific publications, as reflected by
    the 2020 Journal Citation Report [51]. In addition, the IEEE database provides
    access to a comprehensive source of bibliographic citations covering the scope
    of technologies in different fields, including smart agriculture. At this stage,
    2300 papers were obtained. The selection of the IEEE as the only database was
    to balance time restraints and thoroughness. Using IEEE solely is justifiable
    as it is the most extensive database for advancing technologies that guarantee
    to identify sufficient eligible studies and ensure that there is no bias. After
    an initial data set had been collected, a primary analysis has been performed
    to: 1) exclude irrelevant papers based on an exclusion criterion and 2) identify
    research themes. The exclusion criterion was set to ensure that any out-of-scope
    paper should be eliminated. The exclusion criterion was based on papers’ contributions,
    and it included papers that are not related to farming and papers that tackle
    SF from a nontechnology perspective. Papers that are not related to farming included,
    but were not limited to, documents about wind and solar farms, smart cities, animal
    welfare monitoring, and greenhouse gas emissions. Other papers that tackle SF
    from an out-of-scope perspective discuss issues such as designing platforms that
    provide advice to farmers, connecting farmers with other food industry stakeholders
    (customers and retailers), and performing social studies related to SF. The exclusion
    criteria were manually applied to filter papers out. The irrelevant papers were
    filtered manually as adding the “NOT” option in the search criteria would have
    eliminated relevant papers. After filtering the irrelevant papers, the team was
    left with 588 papers. To provide an integral view of the research activity in
    the field of SF, the primary analysis included assessing the papers to identify
    the technology they incorporate. After reviewing all documents, the most analyzed
    SF literature has provided research insight into one of the following themes:
    sensors, big data, communication, actuators and machines, and data analysis. Big
    data refer to techniques adopted to handle issues arising from the difficulties
    in storing, processing, and analyzing the enormous volume of data. After papers
    have been reviewed and tagged with them based on the technology that they incorporate,
    an exhaustive analysis was performed. All included studies were analyzed to draw
    a conclusion on all identified research themes in an impartial and objective way.
    Fig. 1 provides an insight into the structure of each of the themes found that
    will be analyzed holistically in this study. Fig. 1. Taxonomy of the SF literature.
    Show All While some of the literature researches implanting a single technology
    in the field, others show to integrate more than one technology to form a system.
    Fig. 2 shows the breakdown of literature in SF and their contribution to different
    themes and systems. Remote monitoring, automation, and decision support are examples
    of systems present in SF. Any of those systems would include at least two technologies.
    As seen in Fig. 2, the most dominant technology is sensors since they are the
    basis of any SF system. The numbers in Fig. 2 show that some papers do not fit
    in any of the identified themes, while others fall into two or more categories.
    Fig. 2. Heatmap of the SF literature. Show All SECTION III. Analysis: Enabling
    Technologies A. Sensors Sensors are integrated into SF to gather data for various
    reasons, including, but not limited to, environmental monitoring, crop quality
    monitoring, and fertilizers’ control. The deployment of sensors typically takes
    the form of sensor nodes and groups of synchronized sensors that collect data
    and send it to a destination through wireless communication. A sensor node typically
    consists of sensors, a battery, a controller, and a transceiver. A group of connected
    sensor nodes is referred to as a wireless sensor network (WSN). This section focuses
    on sensors and sensor node topologies, including key challenges and solutions
    related to deploying sensors in SF. 1) Sensor Modules: Few papers discuss novel
    sensing techniques [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59] or sensors’
    fabrication [60], [61]. The majority of literature uses commercial off-the-shelf
    sensor modules. Table I lists examples of sensors for environmental and soil-related
    measurements. The sensors listed in Table I have different measuring ranges, accuracies,
    and prices. Practitioners need to choose sensors that work best for their applications.
    An algorithm that optimizes sensor selection for a given application has been
    proposed [62]. TABLE I Commercial of the Shelf Sensor Modules Used in the SF Literature
    2) Sensor Nodes’ Placement and Interconnection in a WSN: Sensors placed in an
    agricultural field can be either stationary or remote. Remote sensors can be accomplished
    in the air through the use of a flying drone [63], [64], [65], [67] or on the
    ground via a patrolled vehicle [68], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. The choice between
    stationary and remote sensor networks comes with a tradeoff between flexibility
    and cost as stationary uses a fixed sensing grid, which limits reconfigurability
    but lower implementation and use cost. A mobile system can adapt to changing uses
    but has higher implementation and use costs. To guarantee the best coverage area
    for stationary sensors, a design process, which ensures that sensors are optimally
    placed, has been utilized. Typical design considerations for static sensors include
    choosing the sensor locations infield and setting a sensor network architecture.
    The two approaches for placing sensors are equal-distanced sensor placement [84],
    [85], [86], [87] and the trial-and-error method [84]. While the former is more
    common, the latter results in more accurate measurements but a longer design process
    [84]. A computational model that ensures strategic deployment of the equal-distanced
    sensor was developed in [55]. Compared to stationary sensors, remote sensors can
    provide a more accurate representation of the field conditions—i.e., better ability
    to detect microclimates—with fewer sensors. However, battery life is an important
    issue that limits the flight time of drones and other mobile platforms. Also,
    remote sensing needs a navigation system. This can be autonomous, such as unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) [68], or may require an operator [88]. Autonomous navigation
    systems are computationally extensive and would require additional spatial measurements.
    Sensor network architecture is concerned with connections between sensors and
    other components to ensure optimal network configuration. Plane and hierarchal
    architecture are two common architectures implemented in the SF literature. A
    plane architecture is where all nodes have the same status, abilities, and roles.
    On the other hand, a hierarchal structure involves having more superior nodes
    responsible for collecting and forwarding data. A plane structure is more straightforward
    and less affected by an individual node’s failure. However, it is impractical
    in a larger network as it will demand extensive energy [104]. A two-level node
    hierarchal structure is more common [85], [105], [106] where the first level (slave
    nodes) senses and sends the data to a more advanced node (referred to as a sink
    or a master node) that sends data to an external source and coordinates the slave
    nodes. A group of slave nodes managed by a master is referred to as a cluster,
    and the master is the cluster head. Clustering sensors to form nodes can be done
    by grouping like sensors together and powering them with different sources according
    to their different needs [107] or making each node heterogeneous to ensure similar
    power demand among nodes [108]. The first is easier to design and requires less
    human work for battery replacements; however, it might be more expensive. Methods
    for calculating the sensor nodes’ energy demand are presented in [108] and [109].
    3) Challenges: A technical concern when deploying a WSN is energy. In a WSN, the
    energy is constrained to the capacity of the battery powering them. The entire
    sensor node fails once the battery is depleted and not recharged or replaced [110],
    [111]. Hence, minimizing the power consumption of the sensor nodes is critical.
    It is also possible to harvest ambient energy to power the sensor node. To reduce
    the power consumption of the sensor node, research utilizes methods that switch
    the nodes [107], [112], [113] or their transceivers (most power-hungry block)
    [85], [114] OFF when not used. This is also known as putting nodes in the sleep
    mode. The sleep time can occur at prescheduled fixed intervals [107] or event-based
    such as to report changing weather conditions [85] (i.e., a rainy, cloudy day
    would require more awake time than a typical summer day). The fixed-interval sleep
    mode saves energy but risks missing data instances when the node is OFF. Also,
    the setup time taken by the transceiver once it wakes up leaves the node more
    vulnerable to transition delays. Another power-saving method is to continuously
    reconfigure the data routing paths (reassigning master and slave nodes) [108],
    [115], [116]. The operating principle of those methods is to develop an algorithm
    that keeps changing the master node, since it is the most energy-intensive, to
    give all nodes a longer lifetime and guarantee that all nodes will be depleted
    together. Reducing the quantity of data that need to be transmitted is important
    for minimizing power [117]. Spatial data compression (nearby nodes talk to check
    repeated patterns in the data) has been used to lower the amount of transmitted
    data [117]. Although data compression requires some additional computations at
    the node level, it was shown that the computation power is much less than the
    power for long-distance communication [117]. Power saving has also been achieved
    using a low-power microcontroller (e.g., MSP430FR5969 and ESP8266EX) that offers
    increased performance at a lower energy budget [102], [118], [119]. Power consumption
    and battery life shape a burden in remote sensing platforms. That is, since using
    the traditional battery charging stations has an impact on mobility, alternatively,
    replacing the battery when depleted requires additional manual work and higher
    initial investment as one would need spare batteries. To this extent, wireless
    power transfer has been investigated to overcome this burden [73], [120], [121].
    Solar energy harvesting has also been deployed in the literature to solve the
    limited power available to sensor nodes [102], [118], [122], [123]. An additional
    power converter accompanies the integration of solar energy to regulate the power
    supply and the battery charging. BQ25570 IC is an example of a commercialized
    power regulator used [102], [124]. Another energy harvesting technique that overcomes
    the limitations of solar, being weather dependent, is using the radio frequency
    (RF) signal to provide energy to the sensor node [125]. A second challenge faced
    is the risk of losing data due to power loss or failure of components. To mitigate
    this risk, IdealVolting, a technique used to explore the possibility of operating
    below the minimum power specifications without compromising the measurement [126],
    has been studied. Moreover, the literature investigates using ML to predict the
    data to interpolate missing points [98], [127], [128] B. Communication The advances
    in the communication field and the IoT architectures have resulted in many protocols
    that can be utilized in SF, leaving flexibility for users’ selections depending
    on their needs and constraints. Generally, the pattern followed is using two communication
    pathways. Machine-to- Gateway (M2G): Communication back and forth between sensors
    or actuators nodes and microcontrollers. Machine-to- Cloud Communication (M2C):
    Passing data through the transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)
    network to a final destination. The choice of data transmission platform is subject
    to many constraints, including available bandwidth, the required transmission
    rate, latency, data volume, and reliability. This section discusses the used protocols
    and challenges faced when designing a communication network. 1) M2G Communication
    Protocols: Various protocols have been utilized to establish M2G communication,
    including: 1) standard protocols, such as Zigbee [77], [129], [130], [131], [132],
    [133], [134], [135], Bluetooth [136], [137], [138], Wi-Fi [89], [90], [139], [140],
    [141], cellular networks [110], [129], [130], [131], [133], [142], and RF identification
    (RFID) [95], [121], [143], [144], [145], [146] and 2) low-power wide area networks
    (LPWANs), such as LORA [147], [148], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155], NB-IoT [156], [157], and Sigfox [99], [158], [159]. RFID is an energy-efficient
    communication technique, but it has a limited coverage area. Zigbee is based on
    an IEEE standard and can be connected easily through an Xbee module. The advantage
    of Zigbee is its low cost and low power consumption. However, Zigbee is limited
    in terms of data rate and coverage area. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are alternatives
    that offer improved data rates. Bluetooth connection can be established by attaching
    the HC-05 module to the Arduino [128], [130], while Wi-Fi can be through the ESP8266
    [132], [133], [134] module or directly through the Raspberry Pi with a built-in
    Wi-Fi module. The main limitation of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is their narrow coverage
    area, which is overcome in cellular networks that offer high-speed communication
    and a wide coverage range. The SF literature has captured the most recent advancements
    in the cellular network to increase the transmission data rate as in [110], which
    utilizes the critical techniques in 5G to accommodate more sensor nodes and prolong
    the lifetime of the WSNs. However, the use of cellular networks consumes more
    energy. LPWAN is a set of emerging network protocols capable of transmitting data
    over a long distance (couple of kilometers) with relatively lower power to overcome
    standard network limitations. The most common LPWAN protocol, in SF, is LoRaWan,
    an open-access protocol that uses LoRa technology. To set up an LoRaWan network,
    one can use a microcontroller that supports an LoRa module, such as Arduino Uno
    that works with the LoRa/GPS shield [160] or the STM32F103 that is compatible
    with the Lora module Ra01 [161]. Setting up the LoRa network requires calibration
    of the sender and receiver antenna gain [160]. NB-IoT is another LPWAN technology
    that offers more coverage area than LoRa [156], and it can be integrated through
    the SIM7020, which can be connected to a Raspberry Pi [157]. Sigfox has also been
    utilized in SF through the Sigfox ship, SFM11R2D [158], or the Sigfox Shield for
    Arduino (UNASHIELD-V2S) [159]. The main drawback of LPWAN is that it has a relatively
    low data rate in comparison to other traditional protocols. The low data rate
    makes utilizing LPWAN impractical for high density of sensors. A solution to mitigate
    this drawback is to utilize a multichannel gateway [152]. Another drawback of
    LPWAN is the risk of data collision when two nodes are sending data simultaneously.
    This challenge has been addressed in [161] by allocating independent time slots
    for transmission for each node. The solutions proposed to overcome LPWAN limitations
    increase power consumption; hence, optimization is needed between power consumption,
    coverage area, and data rate. 2) M2C Communication Protocols: On the other hand,
    the most common method to establish M2C communication in SF is to connect the
    microcontroller to the local wireless network connected to the Internet. Alternatively,
    some papers use the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) [89], [162], the message
    queue telemetry transport (MQTT) [97], [163], [164], or the constrained application
    protocol (CoAP) [165], TCP/IP protocols that are used to establish M2C communication,
    known as IoT protocols. 3) Challenges: The limited resources assigned to the devices’
    communication create challenges in deploying communication networks. In other
    words, the challenge associated with designing a communication network is the
    desire to achieve a firm, reliable, and fast data delivery while optimizing factors
    such as power consumption, cost, and coverage area. Unfortunately, the literature
    did not state one solution that fits all. Hence, SF integrators should explore
    existing solutions and choose according to their application requirements. This
    section demonstrates an overview of the commonly used communication protocols,
    there are many other factors to be considered. For instance, the performance can
    drastically if deployed indoor or outdoor, urban, or rural, and many other factors.
    Detailed comparisons are available in [158], [166], [167], [168], and [169]. C.
    Actuators and Machines In agriculture, robotics has been applied to various fields
    of agriculture. The SF literature that focuses on robotics revolves around two
    issues. The first is designing new robots that perform tasks in the field. The
    second is to improve the performance of existing irrigation machines. 1) Robots:
    The literature used robots for multiple purposes, including spraying or removing
    pesticides [170], [171], [172], [173], irrigation [174], [175], picking crops
    [171], [176], [177], sewing seeds [178], [179], [180], plowing soil [181], [182],
    and harvesting [162], [183]. Robots’ design and development considerations include
    controlling robots, and their parts’ movement [162], [184], [185], selecting and
    integrating motors [180], [186], and the mechanical design of the body/chaise
    [174], [181], [186], [187] are discussed design issues. The most common method
    to track the movement’s motion is utilizing an ultrasonic sensor [171], [174],
    [181], [182]. As for the motors, dc [175], [176], [181], [188] and servo [172],
    [181], [182], [189] motors are the most common motors used. In addition to the
    robots’ design considerations, achieving long-term autonomy is a significant challenge.
    Although advanced control methods exist in different applications, the nature
    of agricultural fields (vast and numerous arrangements of crops) makes it challenging.
    To address the challenge of robots’ motion, adaptive motion control strategies
    have been proposed [73], [190]. Those strategies showed significant improvement
    over methods that require detailed field information. 2) Irrigation System: As
    irrigation is the basis of agriculture, the literature has explored methods to
    achieve efficient automatic irrigation. The most straightforward practice for
    automating the irrigation system is using pipes controlled via a solenoid valve
    [103], [191], [192], [193]. A solenoid valve is an electromechanical device that
    can be switched by a relay placed on solenoid power cables. Using a solenoid valve
    solely might not be adequate for applications that need applied pressure for water
    transfer. Hence, water pumps have been used for irrigation in SF [119], [194],
    [195]. Pumps allow more flexibility in the system design; however, they demand
    more energy. To overcome limited energy, solar-powered irrigation systems [196],
    [197], [198], [199], [200] or passive irrigation systems have been studied. Passive
    systems use pressure-generated columns derived from the water potential to actuate
    the valve [201] or utilize the siphon concept [202]. While those systems do not
    demand any power, they are adequate for limited-field architectures. Hence, there
    is a tradeoff between design flexibility and power consumption. 3) Challenges:
    The challenge faced while designing an SF irrigation system is the limited amount
    of water available in some fields. The research explored methods to minimize water
    consumption, including reusing wastewater (recycling) [196], [202], [203] to overcome
    this challenge. Another water conservation approach is to adopt water management
    schemes to minimize unnecessary watering of the crops [101], [200]. Also, using
    drip irrigation reduces the amount of water used as it is proven to be the most
    water-efficient irrigation method [168], [196], [199], [200]. D. Managing Big
    Data The enormous volumes of data captured by sensors in SF motivate addressing
    big data management in the literature. Managing big data is a discipline concerned
    with using techniques, tools, and platforms to address storage, preprocessing,
    processing, and security challenges. This section discusses the challenge of handling
    big data and presents the techniques adopted to mitigate those challenges. The
    most significant challenge when dealing with big data is the extensive processing
    power and memory needed for its storage and processing. To deal with the limited
    processing and storing capabilities, most literature chooses to send data to a
    central cloud designed to manage a huge amount of data. Thing speak [89], [134],
    [137], [203], [204], [205], [206], Ubidots [94], Blynk [207], [208], OneNet [209],
    Amazon web services [100], and GoogleColab [210], [211] are examples of free IoT
    cloud services. The advantage of using those cloud services is the ease of integration.
    In addition, most clouds are accompanied by a dashboard that provides real-time
    data visualization and can easily be configured to user interfaces (web services
    or mobile applications). However, sending data to the cloud is accompanied by
    costs inherited from the data transfer and latency due to the time taken to send
    signals. To reduce the cost inherited with the transfer, Gia et al. [155], Alonso
    et al. [212], and Ribeiro et al. [213] proposed methods of filtering data at the
    edge, sending only useful data to the cloud. Alternatively, computational and
    data storage procedures can be brought closer to the sensor or actuator node by
    utilizing existing devices’ capacity (known as edge or fog computing) [206], [214],
    [215], [216], [217]. Unlike cloud computing, a single node having infinite capabilities,
    edge and fog computing deploy multiple distributed nodes with limited computational
    abilities and require resource management to ensure proper deployment. To address
    this issue, resource management techniques optimize the use of resources at the
    edge and guarantee fulfilling the application needs [212], [215]. Another challenge
    faced is the deterioration of data quality due to their exposure to cybersecurity
    attacks or accusation and transmission faults, leaving missing and inconsistent
    data. To handle this problem, papers implemented blockchain technology to ensure
    data privacy and authenticity [218], [219], [220]. Darkweb technology has also
    been used to boost the performance of blockchains as it avoids exposure to malicious
    denial of service attacks [221]. Another method used to enhance the security of
    the data is implementing access control systems to ensure that only authorized
    users can control the data [222], [223]. The later problem has been solved by
    utilizing techniques to identify uncertainties or noise in the data and mitigate
    them. Algorithms based on the Boltzmann ML [224], the Kalman filter [225], and
    the longest common subsequence (LCSS) [226] have been utilized for data processing.
    Enhancing the quality of data has also been achieved through interpolation models
    based on fuzzy and neural network (NN) technology [128] and the anomaly detection
    algorithm based on matching old and new data [227]. E. Data Analysis 1) Machine
    Learning Techniques: As SF advances, ML techniques are widely adopted due to their
    potential to achieve reliable solutions to complex problems. Those techniques
    provide useful insight into the massive data generated by sensors through analyzing
    patterns and identifying trends. This section presents applications of data-driven
    decision-making in SF. ML is the process of using data to acquire a model that
    represents the SF system and predicts its outcome. Broadly, ML in SF can be classified
    into regression and classification. Regression algorithms are used to find the
    relationship between continuous variables, while classification algorithms are
    concerned with determining class membership. The functionality, complexity, and
    data required for those algorithms vary significantly. Simple regression algorithms—including
    linear, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stacked regressors—have been
    utilized to estimate the crop yield [228], [229], [230]. Decision tree, K-nearest
    neighbors (KNNs), random forest, naïve Bayes classifier, and support vector machine
    (SVM) are simple classifiers used to predict the most suitable crop for a region
    [210], [231], [232], [233], [234], [235], [236]. The simplicity of those algorithms
    enables presenting the relationship between data without demanding extensive computation
    power and, hence, can be employed at the edge. On the other hand, those models
    are incapable of doing more complex functions; hence, they have limited applications.
    With the development of more advanced computing approaches, deep learning (DL)
    became the mainstream approach. DL utilizes NN models, the network of simple information
    processing units (known as neurons), to model complex relationships and extract
    features from huge datasets. The connection between neurons has a weight associated
    with them, which assigns a weighted sum to inputs of the neuron, and then, the
    resulted sum is passed through an activation function that determines the neuron’s
    final output value. NN has been used in SF for different purposes including soil
    or atmospheric parameter forecasting [98], [237], [238], optimal Environmental
    Conditions prediction [239], and artificial neural networks (ANN) based controller
    to optimize irrigation [240]. The desire of achieving tasks is to produce accurate
    results using NN, while minimizing the training time made the literature use tailored
    architectures, such as recurrent NNs (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs). RNN has a memory buffer that stores the output of hidden layers and feeds
    it back to itself along with the upcoming input. This buffer makes RNN more suitable
    for processing sequential data. The ability to take the sequential information
    into consideration made RNN suitable for forecasting crop yield [241]. CNNs are
    tailored for image recognition tasks as neurons in an early layer of the network
    would extract local visual features, and neurons in later layers would combine
    these features to form higher order features. CNNs proved high accuracy in feature
    extraction in different SF applications, including detecting and diagnosing diseases,
    and weed-infected areas [242], [243], [244], [245], [246], [247], [248], [249],
    [250], determining the plants’ quantity [92], [234], and detecting animals’ intrusion
    [251]. 2) Challenges: One of the challenges faced when applying ML in SF is the
    ability to find sufficient data to train the model. Finding a large data set that
    contains all possible usual conditions (anomalies) is a prerequisite for the success
    of the ML. To overcome this limitation, the literature utilized different sources,
    including weather repositories [217], [252] and image databases [246], [253],
    besides data collected in the field to train the ML model. However, an online
    task-oriented dataset might not be available. Another approach is to use data
    augmentation techniques to create new instances of data from the existing ones
    [248]. Another challenge faced is the noise in datasets, which might be misleading
    if used to train the ML model. Noisy data have been removed by experts in [254].
    Alternatively, Kalman filtering to smooth the data [255] has been used. The high
    computation power and long training time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this,
    papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that adjusts a model trained for
    a different task instead of training from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256],
    [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective results at reduced cost using
    the pretrained model. SECTION IV. Technology Integration Into Systems Numerous
    papers focused on integrating two or more of the aforementioned technologies to
    create an independent system. Among those systems, remote monitoring and autonomous,
    and discoing-making are the most common. Fig. 3 shows the enabling technologies
    used in forming each system. Fig. 3. Breakdown of SF systems. Show All A. Remote
    Monitoring Systems Remote monitoring systems (RMSs) collect data from the physical
    layer (sensors and actuators) and send it to users through a visualization service
    (e.g., mobile app) and/or store data on a database server for further analysis.
    RMS provides the opportunity for farmers to observe the state of their farm, while
    he is away at any moment. Setting up an RMS requires the interconnection of a
    sensor network, a communication network, and a monitoring platform. Due to the
    varying farmers’ capabilities and demands, the RMS architecture did not converge.
    Its complexity ranges from a single sensing node that delivers data locally to
    multiple node systems that include an Internet connection to send data to a back-end
    IoT system. The former system operates on an internal application running on the
    same server, which has been achieved through deploying the global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) network and sending short message/messaging service (SMS)
    to users [189], [258], [259] or through a mobile application that receives data
    via Bluetooth [136]. The advantage of a local system is that it does it require
    an Internet connection from the farmer. This is vital in the case of an emergent
    message being delivered, such as fire. Having no Internet connection is also preferred
    in some developing countries where Internet availability is not guaranteed. However,
    the GSM network that can send a limited amount of data makes it impractical for
    applications requiring the exchange of huge data amounts. The latter system, which
    is more common, utilizes the IoT concept (exchanging data through the Internet),
    which can be done by directly connecting the sensors to the TCP/IP network or
    through a middle layer, as shown in the communication techniques in Section III-A.
    The gateway can be any device composed of a CPU and equipped with a transceiver
    compatible with the used communication protocol. Raspberry Pi is the most common
    gateway. A sample of different IoT solutions is shown in Table II. TABLE II Different
    Arrangements for RMS B. Autonomous Systems Autonomous systems have recently drawn
    researchers’ attention because of the advantages that it brings to the farm, including
    eliminating the need for manual work and saving a significant amount of water
    [94], [261]. The most common autonomous system discussed in the SF literature
    is the irrigation system. Other autonomous systems include controlling the temperature
    using cooling fans [135], [194], [262], heating fans [135], skylight opening [263],
    wet curtains [264], or bare tube heating systems [265], controlling light intensity
    using shutters [194] or artificial lights [135], [262], [266], [267], [268], and
    controlling humidity using water fans [269] or fogging system [268]. Also, systems
    that automate additives such as adding nutrient solutions [270], [271] or pesticides
    [272] in water or injecting carbon dioxide in the air [273] have been considered
    in the literature. The design process of the above autonomous systems involves
    developing control logic and hardware to operate the actuators along with elements
    discussed in Sections III-A–III-C: connectivity of sensors, local data transmission,
    and actuators. The link between the system components requires synchronization
    to ensure flawless operation. Control logic is an algorithm that generates instructions
    to switch actuators, usually through acquiring and analyzing sensors’ data. Time-based
    [274], [275], farmer-based [91], [270], [276], limit-based, and model-based are
    the classes of control logic implemented in the SF literature. Time- and farmer-based
    methods do not use sensors’ readings as they control the actuators according to
    scheduled time slots or instructions from farmers. Limit-based is the most common
    with a predefined threshold. The output of the limit-based can either be binary
    (ON/OFF) [204], [226], [277], [278], [279], [280], [281] or, more flexibly, fuzzy
    [194], [266], [282], [283], [284], [285], [286], [287], [288], [289], [290], [291].
    Model-based algorithms take actions in accordance with a reference model, which
    can be based on scientific equations [101], [292], [293] or on previous data (i.e.,
    ML models) [163], [239], [268], [294], [295], [296]. The fuzzy-based algorithm
    is preferred over other control algorithms as it enables multiple control variables
    without using more complicated mathematical or database models. Achieving the
    desired status of the actuators generated by the control logic has been done in
    the SF literature through two different hardware arrangements. One is by adding
    a hardware interface between the microcontroller and actuators. The second is
    using designated controllers that directly connect to the actuators. Relays [96],
    [142], [207], [233], [267], [271], [279], [292], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301],
    [302], transistors [303], and motor drivers [205], [261] are examples of blocks
    that operate in conjunction with the microcontroller. An alternative arrangement
    is replacing the microcontroller and the additional hardware with a programmable
    logic controller (PLC) [272], [286], [304]. PLCs can be programed to complete
    the entire automation process as their input can be connected to sensors, and
    their output can be connected to the actuators. PLCs are simpler to set up and
    program than combining a microcontroller with a hardware interface. However, they
    are more expensive and enable less freedom for the onboard control logic. C. Intelligent
    Decision-Making Systems Making decisions through sensors embedded in the field,
    data analysis techniques, and methods of handling big data has reshaped agricultural
    practices. Intelligent decision-making systems are included in all SF stages,
    starting from preplantation to postplantation activities. Predicting which crop
    suits the given environmental conditions and estimating expected crop yield are
    examples of preplantation decision-making. Decision-making during the plantation
    process includes identifying plant diseases, recognizing pests, and providing
    optimal nutrients and irrigation needs. Postplantation decision-making is concerned
    with counting and classifying crops. The high computation power and long training
    time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning,
    a technique that adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training
    from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain
    effective results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III summarizes
    all decision-making systems utilized in the literature. Table III shows that the
    most common decision-making system is the disease detection systems. Intelligent
    disease detection systems also provide the benefit of early detection and diagnosis,
    which can minimize losses. Weed detection and finding plants’ needs are the literature’s
    second and third most common decision-making systems. All those systems rely on
    plant pictures to extract features (e.g., color, size, morphology, and texture)
    and then classify them. The most common ML technique used is CNNs, as it has proved
    to produce accurate results for feature extraction and object classification.
    The high accuracy of CNN comes at the cost of demanding higher processing power
    and more extensive data volumes that are not always affordable. To overcome the
    limitations of CNN, many papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training a model from
    scratch or other ML techniques with CNN. TABLE III Intelligent Decision-Making
    Systems in SF The high computation power and long training time of NNs shape a
    burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training from scratch
    [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective
    results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III also lists various
    sources of data in SF. The selection of the data source is a significant concern
    as it is a prerequisite for the success of the ML approach. Finding the appropriate
    data source is challenging because most ML algorithms need to be trained on a
    large dataset to optimize many parameters. In addition, supervised ML methods
    require the labeling of the data set, which requires a large amount of the experts’
    work. Given those challenges, four sources of data were used in SF literature:
    1) installed sensors; 2) weather stations collecting meteorological data; 3) online
    databases; and 4) agricultural reference material. SECTION V. Discussion The main
    observation of surveying papers on SF is that none of the solutions is satisfactory
    for all SF applications. Hence, practitioners need to choose the one that fits
    their needs and obliges them to their constraints. For instance, sensor integrators
    need to consider the cost, power consumption, and design complexity while choosing
    the sensor types, quantity, and placement methods. As for the communication network,
    there is a tradeoff between power consumption, coverage area, and data rate. On
    the actuation side, having flexibility in designing the irrigation system comes
    at the cost of demanding high power to operate. Finally, on the data side, there
    is a tradeoff between the functionalities provided by the data analysis technique,
    the computation power, and the amount of data demanded. To this end, although
    many papers discuss using commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware platforms
    to provide the needed functionality, none of them performs a technoeconomic analysis.
    The SF literature lacks an analysis of technology integration’s effect on crop
    yield and returns on investment. In addition, the SF literature should have more
    discussion on the scalability and robustness of the proposed technologies. This
    can be done by expanding this work from a theoretical/experimental concept to
    an applicable industrial model and evaluating its effectiveness. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    The field of agriculture is heavily shifting toward utilizing technological solutions
    to enhance agriculture productivity, SF. This article presented a comprehensive
    survey of the state-of-the-art research performed in the field of SF. To this
    end, this article identified the most influential technologies affecting farming
    practices and structures. Analysis of technology integration is presented highlighting
    their advancements, challenges, and solutions. The discussion in this article
    provides a better understanding of the essential dimensions of innovative technologies
    for integrators. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The statements made herein are solely the responsibility

    Location: Sydney, Australia SECTION I. Introduction The agricultural sector plays
    a vital role in economic stability and ensuring food security, necessitating a
    reevaluation of agricultural development strategies with a focus on national food
    security. However, the challenge lies in sustaining water supply to meet the growing
    demand. Water scarcity remains a significant obstacle to sustainable cultivation,
    despite the potential use of reclaimed or desalinated water for irrigation purposes.
    These alternatives face obstacles such as safety risks, high energy requirements,
    and cost concerns [1–3]. Traditional irrigation systems typically distribute water
    uniformly to all farmers without considering specific field parameters, leading
    to untimely and excessive irrigation. This not only depletes freshwater resources
    but also hampers crop quality and restricts plant respiration and growth due to
    excessive soil moisture [4]. Furthermore, excess water can contribute to soil
    salinity, diminishing soil fertility and reducing available arable land [5]. Precision
    agriculture offers a solution by enhancing production and minimizing water usage
    [6]. Thus, there is a need for innovative irrigation systems that promote sustainable
    food production while optimizing irrigation water consumption [7–10]. Such systems
    should deliver the appropriate quantity of water at the right time to enhance
    agricultural productivity. Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely employed in
    irrigation systems over the last decade. However, some of these systems collect
    and measure irrigation parameters and then introduce it to the farmers to decide
    based on their experience if the irrigation needed or not. In these systems, the
    irrigation process is still manual and depend on farmers experience and judgment.
    Therefore, several systems proposed employing different machine learning methods
    to automate the irrigation process by predicting the irrigation need according
    to the parameters value. Nevertheless, important parameters were not considered
    which leads to an inefficient irrigation system in terms of time, period, and
    quantity. Moreover, transmitting all acquired data to cloud for processing in
    large-scale farms increases the latency of these systems. The possibility of sensors
    failure issue was not considered in the existing systems. SECTION II. Related
    Works Several commercial IoT modules, namely the CropX sensor [11], Teralytic
    sensor [12], Mark2 sensor [13], and Libelium Kit [14], are available for irrigation
    scheduling. These modules vary in price from $ 1000 to $ 5000. The CropX sensor
    detects soil moisture, temperature, weather conditions, and electrical conductivity
    at different depths, operating independently with its own communication components
    and costing approximately $ 600. It offers potential water savings of up to 30%.
    The Teralytic sensor probe, priced at up to $ 4300, monitors soil NPK levels,
    pH, moisture, temperature, and weather conditions but requires a connected hub
    for data transfer, and no water savings findings have been published for this
    technology. The Mark2 sensor, costing around $ 1600, shares similar features with
    the previously mentioned modules. On the other hand, the Libelium agriculture
    kit measures soil moisture, temperature, humidity, leaf wetness, and air pressure,
    includes data visualization software, and is priced at $ 5000. However, these
    existing tools and systems are not cost-effective, leading to dependence on imported
    solutions and posing maintenance challenges. Consequently, there is a demand for
    an affordable, locally manufactured IoT device tailored to specific area requirements.
    Accurate real-time calculation of soil moisture plays a vital role in effective
    irrigation scheduling. This involves predicting daily reference evapotranspiration
    ET0 to determine crop evapotranspiration ETC and irrigation needs [15]. Leveraging
    IoT technology enables the availability of real-time weather and soil data, significantly
    improving the precision of irrigation decision-making [16]. In a previous study
    [17], an IoT-based irrigation system was developed to optimize water consumption
    and time efficiency, resulting in a remarkable 90% reduction in water usage compared
    to conventional methods. Another application conducted in Mediterranean environments
    demonstrated a 25% saving in irrigation water [18]. Enhancing communication range,
    a network system was integrated with the HC12 module [19]. Fig. 1. Architecture
    of the Proposed Smart Irrigation System Show All In a different approach [20],
    a cloud-based framework was designed for urban irrigation in a multilevel plant
    pot. Each node consisted of a local decision-making system, sensors, and actuators,
    with data transmitted to the cloud for analysis, leading to reduced water consumption.
    Machine learning techniques were implemented in [21] for IoT-based irrigation
    control on a small testbed. The system utilized microcontroller base boards and
    various soil and environmental parameters for irrigation predictions. However,
    water savings were not specifically evaluated, and the equipment’s suitability
    for harsh conditions was not addressed. Similarly, in [22], a machine learning-based
    decision system was proposed, but specific assessments of water savings were not
    provided. A study in Spain compared different machine learning techniques for
    autonomous irrigation scheduling [23]. The study used agronomical and weather
    data from citrus orchards and found that the prediction error was less than 10%
    compared to recommended values. Tunnel farming irrigation scheduling was addressed
    in [24], where sensors collected readings for light, temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture. Fuzzy logic was applied to determine irrigation needs, and the
    data was accessible via an app or web browser. This study focused on tunnel farming,
    employed fuzzy logic for smart scheduling decisions, and reduced energy use. In
    [25], a fully automated controlled subsurface irrigation system was designed and
    validated for date palms in arid regions. Real-time soil data was used for irrigation
    management, and the system outperformed time-based scheduling. However, most previous
    studies were limited to small-scale farms and did not address the reliability
    issues of irrigation systems or consider the impact of extensive data on decision-making
    time. Some studies relied on few irrigation parameters, which degraded irrigation
    accuracy, especially in machine learning-based systems. SECTION III. Proposed
    Smart Irrigation System The smart irrigation system consists of four main layers:
    acquisition, communication, processing, and application, as depicted in Fig. 1.
    In the acquisition layer, a group of sensors is utilized to gather plant-related
    data. These sensors include temperature and humidity sensors, moisture sensors,
    wind speed sensors, and water flow sensors. The acquired data is then transmitted
    through wires to a microcontroller in the communication layer. The microcontroller
    is responsible for data processing and decision-making in the processing layer.
    Its role is to minimize the irrigation decision time by reducing the data transmission
    interval. To accommodate large-scale farms, the farms are divided into multiple
    zones, each served by different microcontrollers. Fig. 2 illustrates an example
    of a large-scale farm divided into several zones with different crop types. Fig.
    2. A large-scale farm with several zones. Show All Fig. 3. Architecture of the
    Proposed Smart Irrigation System Show All Fig. 3 illustrates the detailed sequence
    diagram of the proposed irrigation system. Sensor readings, including moisture
    ratio, humidity level, temperature degree, and wind speed, are transmitted to
    the microcontroller to obtain real-time data from the farm. This data is then
    sent to the user platform for monitoring purposes. To determine the irrigation
    requirement, a machine learning model utilizing a classification technique will
    be constructed. The model will be developed using the dataset presented in [26].
    Based on the model’s decision, the pump will be automatically turned on and off.
    However, the user retains the ability to manually control the pump if necessary.
    The model will be built based on a classification algorithm using dataset presented
    in [26]. Classification algorithms identify which category an object belongs to.
    Five different classification algorithms will be compared to determine the most
    accurate algorithm that can be used with our dataset. These algorithms were chosen
    since they are the most common algorithms used for classification problems [27].
    The algorithms are Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), K-Nearest
    Neighbors (KNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting with DART (xgbDART), Support Vector
    Machine with Radial Basis Function (svmRadial), and Environmental and Ecological
    Response Type (EARTH). RF is an ensemble learning method that constructs decision
    trees and outputs the mode or mean prediction of the individual trees. AdaBoost
    combines weak learners to create a strong learner with high accuracy. KNN is a
    non-parametric algorithm that assigns labels based on the nearest neighbors. xgbDART
    uses dropout regularization to enhance model performance. svmRadial uses the RBF
    kernel to model complex relationships. EARTH, specifically MARS, fits piecewise
    linear models in sub-regions. These algorithms have various advantages and applications
    in fields such as bioinformatics, finance, image processing, and environmental
    science, offering flexibility, accuracy, interpretability, and the ability to
    handle different types of data. SECTION IV. System Implementation This section
    describes the main layouts of implementing the proposed smart irrigation system
    including hardware, and software layouts. A. Building Smart Irrigation Unit To
    gather irrigation information, the proposed smart irrigation system will utilize
    commercial sensors and microcontrollers. Data such as soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, wind speed, and water flow will be collected by the sensors to make
    informed decisions about irrigation requirements. The temperature-humidity sensor
    will provide humidity and temperature readings, while the soil moisture sensor
    will detect soil moisture levels. A data collection microcontroller equipped with
    a WiFi module will enable wireless transmission of data to the user. The smart
    irrigation unit’s construction is illustrated in Figure 4. The soil moisture sensor
    is connected to the analog input pins (A0, A1, A2, and A3) of the Arduino Uno
    which is used as a microcontroller. The sensor’s VCC pin is connected to the Arduino’s
    5V pin, and the GND pin is connected to the Arduino’s GND pin. The temperature-humidity
    sensor is connected to the ESP32’s GPIO pins, with the VCC pin connected to the
    3.3 V pin, the GND pins connected to each other, and the data pin connected to
    any available GPIO pin. The flow meter sensor is connected to a digital input
    pin on the Arduino Uno, with the VCC pin connected to the Arduino’s 5V pin, the
    GND pin connected to the Arduino’s GND pin, and the data pin connected to the
    chosen digital input pin. Fig. 4. The main steps to develop the proposed system.
    Show All The wind speed sensor is connected to the ESP32’s GPIO pins, with the
    VCC pin connected to the ESP32’s 3.3 V pin, the GND pin connected to the ESP32’s
    GND pin, and the data pin connected to any available GPIO pin. A relay is connected
    to a digital output pin on the Arduino Uno, with the VCC pin of the relay connected
    to the Arduino’s 5V pin and the GND pin connected to the Arduino’s GND pin. The
    water pump is connected to the relay’s output pins, with the positive wire of
    the water pump connected to the normally open (NO) pin of the relay and the negative
    wire connected to the GND pin of the Arduino. The ESP32 is connected to WiFi to
    transmit the irrigation information to the mobile platform. B. Smart irrigation
    Model Development The five classification algorithms were compacted using RStudio
    to determine the most accurate algorithm for our scenario. Fig. 5 shows a screenshot
    of RStudio IDE interface. The irrigation dataset presented in [27] will be employed
    for training and testing to build machine learning models. The dataset consists
    of 4,893 experiments with six different parameters (i.e., air temperature, relative
    humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, soil temperature, and soil moisture). The
    irrigation dataset is collected in Sohar, Oman, where the hot season lasts for
    4.1 months, from May 3 to September 6, with an average daily high temperature
    above 93°F. The cool season lasts for 3.1 months, from December 7 to March 10,
    with an average daily high temperature below 80°F. [28]. Fig. 5. The main steps
    to develop the proposed system. Show All Fig. 6 shows a comparison between these
    classification algorithms in terms of Accuracy and Keppa. Keppa refers to the
    level of agreement between raters or observers who are rating the same categorical
    items or variables. The findings show that the xgbDART algorithm has the highest
    accuracy with around 68% accuracy and 0.49 agreement level. Accordingly, xgbDART
    algorithm was selected to build the smart irrigation model. Fig. 6. A comparison
    between five classification algorithms. Show All Then, the model was built using
    Colab notebook and TensorFlow. Fig. 7 shows Colab and Tensorflow screenshots.
    The TensorFlow Core APIs are used to build Machine Learning (ML) models, authoring
    ML workflow tools and frameworks. TensorFlow provides a set of comprehensive,
    composable, and extensible low-level APIs for high-performance (distributed &
    accelerated) computation. Fig. 7. A comparison between five classification algorithms.
    Show All SECTION V. Results and Discussion The proposed system was tested for
    ten days to observe total irrigation water and irrigation decision time as shown
    in Fig. 8. The readings of the sensors were exported to an external txt file through
    CoolTerm software. The irrigation readings were observed starting from 9 until
    10 February to test the developed system as shown in Fig. 9. The readings were
    sent to the user through the mobile platform for monitoring. Fig. 8. Irrigation
    process using the proposed system for ten days. Show All Fig. 9. The observed
    readings from the sensors. Show All The system was tested in a small pot, hence,
    the total irrigation water consumption throughout the ten days was around 1 Liter.
    The readings are calculated from the flow meter which measures the flow of the
    water in L/min. The volume of the total water by summing the average of each irrigation
    event. The speed of fire detection was around 1 Second which is too low since
    a small pot was used for test. Fig. 10 shows the sensors readings in the developed
    platform. Fig. 10. Screenshot of the platform that shows sensor readings. Show
    All SECTION VI. Conclusion Traditional irrigation methods fall short in efficiently
    managing water shortage. Precision agriculture, however, offers a solution by
    optimizing production and minimizing water usage. This study developed a smart
    irrigation system based on IoT that incorporates essential irrigation parameters
    like soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and wind speed. The system employs
    a decision-making process that is built based on xgbDART classification algorithm.
    Five classification algorithms were evaluated to identify the most accurate one
    for the project’s requirements. The model was built using TensorFlow and tested
    for ten days, resulting in an irrigation water consumption of approximately 1
    liter with a low irrigation speed of 1 second, attributed to small-scale testing.
    Future improvements include considering additional parameters such as crop type,
    evapotranspiration, and radiation rate to enhance irrigation accuracy. Expanding
    the dataset size would also enhance accuracy and Kappa values. Further work involves
    testing the system on a larger scale and utilizing cloud servers for data storage
    and analysis, enabling insights into irrigation patterns throughout the year and
    seasonal water quantities. Authors Figures References Keywords More Like This

  description: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart agriculture
    management has emerged as a promising approach to address challenges in the agricultural
    sector. This abstract provides an overview of the concept of integrated IoT system
    solutions for smart agriculture management, highlighting its benefits and applications.
    The integrated IoT system combines IoT sensors, devices, and cloud-based platforms
    to enable real- time data collection, analysis, and decision-making in agriculture.
    By deploying IoT sensors across the farm, farmers can gather data on crucial environmental
    parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This data empowers
    farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest
    control, leading to optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields. Automation
    is another key aspect of integrated IoT systems in agriculture. IoT -enabled machinery
    and equipment, such as tractors, drones, and sensors, can automate tasks like
    seeding, spraying, and harvesting. This automation reduces manual labor, minimizes
    errors, and increases operational efficiency. The integration of data analytics
    and machine learning algorithms in IoT systems enables the extraction of valuable
    insights from the collected data. Farmers can leverage these insights for proactive
    decision-making, early disease detection, and yield prediction. In this study,
    as per the required temperature and relative humidity, tomatoes are grown in spring-summer
    and pea in winter seasons. To detect the moisture content of the soil at various
    temperatures and relative humidity levels, soil moisture sensor is also deployed
    in the field. Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture all exhibit a wide range
    of variations. In conclusion, the integration of IoT technology in smart agriculture
    management through an integrated IoT system solution holds great potential for
    optimizing farming practices, increasing productivity, and promoting sustainable
    agriculture. Further research and technological advancements are needed to overcome
    challenges and fully realize the benefits of integrated IoT systems in agriculture.

    Review The implementation of an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management
    requires a well-defined methodology that encompasses various stages of deployment
    and operation. The following paragraphs outline the key steps involved in the
    methodology. The first step in the methodology involves identifying the specific
    needs and objectives of the farm or agricultural operation. This includes understanding
    the key challenges faced by the farmers, such as water management, crop health
    monitoring, or pest control. By clearly defining the goals, the subsequent steps
    can be tailored to address the specific requirements of the farm [1]. In [10],
    a comprehensive analysis of the farm''s infrastructure and environment is conducted.
    This involves identifying the areas where IoT sensors and devices can be strategically
    deployed. Factors such as soil type, topography, and crop types are considered
    to determine the optimal sensor placement for data collection. Additionally, the
    integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment is evaluated to automate farming
    operations. Once the sensor and device placement is determined, the next step
    involves selecting the appropriate IoT hardware and connectivity solutions. This
    includes choosing sensors for measuring environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The selection of IoT gateways or
    hubs, communication protocols, and network connectivity options (e.g., cellular,
    Wi-Fi, LoRa Wan) are also important considerations. After the hardware selection,
    the IoT system''s deployment phase begins. This involves installing the sensors
    and devices in the designated locations across the farm. Careful calibration and
    testing of the IoT infrastructure are conducted to ensure accurate data collection
    and reliable connectivity. The integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment
    also takes place during this phase. Once the IoT system is deployed and operational,
    the focus shifts to data management and analytics. The collected sensor data is
    transmitted to a centralized cloud platform, where it is stored securely and processed
    in real-time. Data analytics techniques, including statistical analysis and machine
    learning algorithms, are applied to derive meaningful insights from the collected
    data. These insights can be related to irrigation scheduling, crop health monitoring,
    disease detection, and other relevant factors [6]. The final step in the methodology
    involves the utilization of the generated insights to make informed decisions
    and take necessary actions. Farmers and agricultural professionals can access
    the cloud-based platform through user- friendly interfaces, enabling them to monitor
    the farm''s performance, receive alerts and notifications, and access actionable
    recommendations. This allows for proactive management of the farm, optimizing

    continuous monitoring and maintenance of the IoT system are essential. Regular
    checks are conducted to ensure the proper functioning of sensors, connectivity,
    and data transmission. Firmware updates, security patches, and system upgrades
    are performed to keep the IoT infrastructure up to date and protected against
    potential vulnerabilities [5]. to summarize, the methodology for implementing
    an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management involves identifying
    needs, analyzing the farm''s infrastructure, selecting appropriate IoT hardware,
    deploying the system, managing and analyzing data, and utilizing insights for
    decision-making. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the system''s reliability

    \ \nGROWTH \nSummary \nSensors and sensor networks have an important impact in\
    \ meeting environmental challenges. Sensor \napplications in multiple fields such\
    \ as smart power grids, smart buildings and smart industrial process \ncontrol\
    \ significantly contribute to more efficient use of resources and thus a reduction\
    \ of greenhouse gas \nemissions and other sources of pollution.  \nThis report\
    \ gives an overview of sensor technology and fields of application of sensors\
    \ and sensor \nnetworks. It discusses in detail selected fields of application\
    \ that have high potential to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and reviews studies\
    \ quantifying the environmental impact. \nThe review of the studies assessing\
    \ the impact of sensor technology in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions reveals\
    \ that the technology has a high potential to contribute to a reduction of emissions\
    \ across \nvarious fields of application. Whereas studies clearly estimate an\
    \ overall strong positive effect in smart \ngrids, smart buildings, smart industrial\
    \ applications as well as precision agriculture and farming, results for \nthe\
    \ field of smart transportation are mixed due to rebound effects. In particular\
    \ intelligent transport systems \nrender transport more efficient, faster and\
    \ cheaper. As a consequence, demand for transportation and thus \nthe consumption\
    \ of resources both increase which can lead to an overall negative effect.  \n\
    This illustrates the crucial role governments have to enhance positive environmental\
    \ effects. Increased \nefficiency should be paralleled with demand-side management\
    \ to internalise environmental costs. Further, \nminimum standards in the fields\
    \ of smart buildings and smart grids in regard to energy efficiency can \nsignificantly\
    \ reduce electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, this report\
    \ also \nhighlights that applications of sensor technology are still at an early\
    \ stage of development. Government \nprogrammes demonstrating and promoting the\
    \ use of sensor technology as well as the development of open \nstandards could\
    \ contribute to fully tap the potential of the technology to mitigate climate\
    \ change.  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN\
    \ GROWTH – 7 \n \n7 \nSensor technology for green growth \nEnvironmental degradation\
    \ and global warming are among the major global challenges facing us. \nThese\
    \ challenges include improving the efficient use of energy as well as climate\
    \ change. ICTs and the \nInternet play a vital role in both, being part of the\
    \ problem (they consume energy and are a source of \npollution) and have the potential\
    \ to provide important solutions to it (ICT applications in other sectors have\
    \ \nmajor potential to improve environmental performance). \nVarious examples\
    \ illustrate the role of ICTs as a provider of solutions to environmental challenges:\
    \ \nSmart grids and smart power systems in the energy sector can have major impacts\
    \ on improving energy \ndistribution and optimising energy usage (Adam and Wintersteller,\
    \ 2008). Smart housing can contribute to \nmajor reductions of energy use in hundreds\
    \ of millions of buildings. Smart transportation systems are a \npowerful way\
    \ of organising traffic more efficiently and reducing CO2 emissions.  \nAll these\
    \ applications have one important attribute in common: They all rely on sensor\
    \ technology \nand often on sensor networks. Because of the important impact of\
    \ applications of sensors and sensor \nnetworks in meeting environmental challenges,\
    \ this analysis has been developed in the context of OECD’s \nwork \non \nICTs\
    \ \nand \nenvironmental \nchallenges \n[see \nalso \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)3/FINAL\
    \ \nand \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)4/FINAL, and DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)2/FINAL for broadband\
    \ investments in smart \ngrids] and the WPIE’s Programme of Work 2009–2010. It\
    \ is also a direct follow-up to the Seoul \nDeclaration for the Future of the\
    \ Internet Economy, issued at the close of the OECD Ministerial Meeting \nin June\
    \ 2008, which invited the OECD and stakeholders to explore the role of information\
    \ and \ncommunication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet in addressing environmental\
    \ challenges.  \nThe report opens with some technological fundamentals in describing\
    \ sensor technology and sensor \nnetworks. This is followed by an overview of\
    \ different fields of application. Selected sensor and sensor \nnetwork applications\
    \ are discussed as well as their environmental impact.  \nSensors, actuators and\
    \ sensor networks – a technology overview \nSensors measure multiple physical\
    \ properties and include electronic sensors, biosensors, and chemical \nsensors.\
    \ This paper deals mainly with sensor devices which convert a signal detected\
    \ by these devices into \nan electrical signal, although other kinds of sensors\
    \ exist. These sensors can thus be regarded as “the \ninterface between the physical\
    \ world and the world of electrical devices, such as computers” (Wilson, \n2008).\
    \ The counterpart is represented by actuators that function the other way round,\
    \ i.e. whose tasks \nconsist in converting the electrical signal into a physical\
    \ phenomenon (e.g. displays for quantities measures \nby sensors (e.g. speedometers,\
    \ temperature reading for thermostats).  \nTable 1 provides examples of the main\
    \ sensor types and their outputs. Further sensors include \nchemical sensors and\
    \ biosensors but these are not dealt with in this report. Outputs are mainly voltages,\
    \ \nresistance changes or currents. Table 1 shows that sensors which measure different\
    \ properties can have the \nsame form of electrical output (Wilson, 2008).  \n\

    \ based on Wilson, 2008. \nWireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are networks\
    \ of nodes that sense and potentially also \ncontrol their environment. They communicate\
    \ the information through wireless links “enabling interaction \nbetween people\
    \ or computers and the surrounding environment” (Verdone et al., 2008). The data\
    \ gathered \nby the different nodes is sent to a sink which either uses the data\
    \ locally, through for example actuators, or \nwhich “is connected to other networks\
    \ (e.g. the Internet) through a gateway (Verdone et al., 2008). \nFigure 1 illustrates\
    \ a typical WSAN1. \nSensor nodes are the simplest devices in the network. As\
    \ their number is usually larger than the \nnumber of actuators or sinks, they\
    \ have to be cheap. The other devices are more complex because of the \nfunctionalities\
    \ they have to provide (Verdone et al., 2008). \nA sensor node typically consists\
    \ of five main parts: one or more sensors gather data from the \nenvironment.\
    \ The central unit in the form of a microprocessor manages the tasks. A transceiver\
    \ (included \nin the communication module in Figure 2) communicates with the environment\
    \ and a memory is used to \nstore temporary data or data generated during processing.\
    \ The battery supplies all parts with energy (see \nFigure 2). To assure a sufficiently\
    \ long network lifetime, energy efficiency in all parts of the network is \ncrucial.\
    \ Due to this need, data processing tasks are often spread over the network, i.e.\
    \ nodes co-operate in \ntransmitting data to the sinks (Verdone et al., 2008).\
    \ Although most sensors have a traditional battery there \nis some early stage\
    \ research on the production of sensors without batteries, using similar technologies\
    \ to \npassive RFID chips without batteries. \n \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ can be \ndetected by sensor networks so that they can be fought at an early\
    \ stage. Sensor networks can be used to \nmonitor the structural integrity of\
    \ civil structures by localising damage for example in bridges. Further, \n10\

    \ fields of application. The upper part of Figure 3 shows fields of \napplication\
    \ discussed in more detail in this study as they have a high potential to tackle\
    \ environmental \nchallenges and reduce CO2 emissions. The fields of application\
    \ in the lower part of the figure are briefly \ndiscussed in Appendix A1 to give\
    \ an overview of further interesting fields of application.  \nSelected applications\
    \ and their environmental impact \nSmart grids and energy control systems  \n\
    Introduction, definition and main components \nCoal power plants are responsible\
    \ for “nearly 40% of electricity production worldwide”, and \nelectricity generation\
    \ is thus responsible for a significant share of CO2 emissions (Atkinson, Castro,\
    \ 2008). \nTo decrease emissions from the energy supply side, alternative clean\
    \ technologies can be used to generate \nelectricity or energy can be distributed\
    \ in a more efficient way. In both cases, sensor networks contribute to \nbetter\
    \ and more efficient processes.  \nOn the generation side, sensor networks enable\
    \ solar energy to be generated more efficiently. \nStandalone panels “do not always\
    \ capture the sun’s power in the most efficient manner” (Atkinson, Castro, \n\
    2008). Automated panels managed by sensors track sun rays to ensure that the sun’s\
    \ power is gathered in a \nmore efficient manner. Such systems can also turn on\
    \ and off automatically (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\
    \ TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH – 11 \n \n11 \nOn the distribution\
    \ side, energy is distributed in an often inefficient way in traditional grids.\
    \ At the \ntime when present girds were planned and extended, they had one single\
    \ mission, namely “to keep the \nlights on” (DOE, 2008). As a consequence, these\
    \ grids have several shortcomings: many systems are \ncentralised and rely on\
    \ important central power stations making it difficult to integrate distributed\
    \ energy \nresources and microgrids (EU, 2006). They most often only support one-way\
    \ power flow and \ncommunication from the utility to consumers. Further, utilities\
    \ can barely track how energy is consumed \nacross the grid (Atkinson and Castro,\
    \ 2008) and, as a consequence, have no possibility to provide any \npricing incentive\
    \ to balance power consumption over time. As utilities can only accommodate increases\
    \ in \ndemand up to a certain level, they are forced to rely on additional peak\
    \ load power plants to cope with \nunexpected demand increases (Climate Group,\
    \ 2008). This is highly expensive and potentially polluting, \nparticularly if\
    \ plants use fossil fuels (Atkinson and Castro, 2008).  \nAs demand rises and\
    \ additional power from distributed resources is fed into the grid, important\
    \ \nchanges must be made. The smart grid is an innovation that has the potential\
    \ to revolutionise the \ntransmission, distribution and conservation of energy.\
    \ It employs digital technology to improve \ntransparency and to increase reliability\
    \ as well as efficiency. ICTs and especially sensors and sensor \nnetworks play\
    \ a major role in turning traditional grids into smart grids. However, they are\
    \ only one group \nof key components of the smart grid. The following section\
    \ gives an extensive overview of the concept of \nthe smart grid and its key components\
    \ beyond a pure discussion of sensors and sensor networks as major \nbenefits\
    \ only arise from the interaction between these components.  \nDefining the smart\
    \ grid in a concise way is not an easy task as the concept is relatively new and\
    \ as \nvarious alternative components build up a smart grid. Some authors even\
    \ argue that it is “too hard” to \ndefine the concept (Miller, 2008). Looking\
    \ at different definitions reveals that the smart grid has been \ndefined in different\
    \ ways by different organisations and authors. Table 2 gives an overview of selected\
    \ \ndefinitions. It shows two different approaches to define the smart grid: it\
    \ is either defined from a solution \nperspective (“What are the main advantages\
    \ of the grid?”) or from a components’ perspective (“Which \ncomponents constitute\
    \ the grid?”). \n12 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR\

    \ \nA “smart grid” is a set of software and hardware tools that enable generators\
    \ \nto route power more efficiently, reducing the need for excess capacity and\
    \ \nallowing two-way, real time information exchange with their customers for\
    \ \nreal time demand side management (DSM). It improves efficiency, energy \n\
    monitoring and data capture across the power generation and T&D network.  \nAdam\

    \ and automated control systems, enables real-time market \ntransactions and seamless\
    \ interfaces among people, buildings, industrial \nplants, generation facilities,\
    \ and the electric networks. \n \nFrom a solution perspective, the smart grid\
    \ is characterised by: \n \nMore efficient energy routing and thus an optimised\

    \ generated close to the customer to be served which improves \nreliability, can\
    \ reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time expand efficient energy\
    \ delivery \n(DOE, 2008). Furthermore, most of these alternative energy generation\
    \ technologies close to customers \nsuch as solar panels and wind power stations\
    \ are renewable energy sources. These technologies, e.g. solar \npanels, small\
    \ hydro-electric and small hydro-thermals can be operated by consumers, or small\
    \ providers. \nSmart devices and smart metering \nSmart devices and smart metering\
    \ include sensors and sensor networks. Sensors are used at multiple \nplaces along\
    \ the grid, e.g. at transformers and substations or at customers’ homes (Shargal\
    \ and Houseman, \n2009b). They play an outstanding role in the area of remote\
    \ monitoring and they enable demand-side \nmanagement and thus new business processes\
    \ such as real-time pricing.  \n14 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n14 \nSpread over the grid, sensors and sensor networks\
    \ monitor the functioning and the health of grid \ndevices, monitor temperature,\
    \ provide outage detection and detect power quality disturbances. Control \ncentres\
    \ can thus immediately receive accurate information about the actual condition\
    \ of the grid. \nConsequently, maintenance staff can maintain the grid just-in-time\
    \ in the case of disruptions rather than \nrely on interval-based inspections.\
    \  \nSmart meters at customers’ homes play a crucial role. They allow for real-time\
    \ determination and \ninformation storage of energy consumption and provide “the\
    \ possibility to read consumption both locally \nand remotely” (Siderius and Dijkstra,\
    \ 2005). Further, they also provide the means to detect fluctuations and \npower\
    \ outages, permit remote limitations on consumption by customers and permit the\
    \ meters to be \nswitched off. This results in important cost savings and enables\
    \ utilities to prevent electricity theft.2  \nFigure 5: Smart meter  \n \nSource:\
    \ Siemens, 2008. \nElectricity providers get a better picture of customers’ energy\
    \ consumption and obtain a precise \nunderstanding of energy consumption at different\
    \ points in time. As a consequence, utilities are able to \nestablish demand-side\
    \ management (DSM) and to develop new pricing mechanisms. Energy can be priced\
    \ \naccording to real-time costs taking peak power loads into account and price\
    \ signals can be transmitted to \nhome controllers or customers’ devices which\
    \ may then evaluate the information and power accordingly \n(DOE, 2003). Customers\
    \ thus become more interactive with suppliers and “benefit from an increased \n\
    visibility into their energy consumption habits” (IBM, 2007). They are aware of\
    \ actual power costs rather \nthan only obtaining a monthly or even yearly electricity\
    \ bill. To date, a number of OECD countries (Italy, \nNorway, Spain, Sweden and\
    \ the Netherlands) have mandated the use of smart meters.  \nIntegrated communication\
    \ technologies \nInformation provided by smart sensors and smart meters needs\
    \ to be transmitted via a communication \nbackbone. This backbone is characterized\
    \ by a high-speed and two-way flow of information. Different \ncommunication applications\
    \ and technologies form the communication backbone. These can be classified \n\
    into communication services groups (EPRI, 2006). Figure 6 provides an overview\
    \ of these groups as well \nas brief descriptions and examples.  \n \nSMART SENSOR\

    \ \n Utilities have the choice between multiple and diverse technologies in the\
    \ area of communication \nnetwork technologies. Usually, several network technologies\
    \ are deployed within a smart grid. The \nfollowing paragraphs provide an overview\
    \ of different wide-area networks (WAN) and local-area networks \n(LAN). The distinction\
    \ between WAN and LAN technologies is made in this context to differentiate \n\
    between networks used to reach the customer and those at customer sites (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). \nWide-area network technologies provide a means for a two-way information\
    \ flow in the smart grid. \nMultiple technologies are available which provide\
    \ both broadband and narrowband solutions for the smart \ngrid, resulting in a\
    \ highly fragmented market. Table 3 presents the main WAN technologies as well\
    \ as their \nstrengths and weaknesses for their deployment in the smart grid.\
    \  \nThe choice of WAN technologies will depend on factors such as reliability,\
    \ low-cost, security and the \nnetwork infrastructure that is already available.\
    \ It is likely that utilities will rely on several network \ntechnologies when\
    \ they build smart grids as they have to cope with differences in geography, population\
    \ \ndensities as well as availability and competition of different network technologies\
    \ in their services areas. \nSome of these will require broadband, some will not.\

    \ \npower line communications (EPRI, 2006).  \nWireless IEEE standards include\

    \ (IEEE 802.15.1). Based on EPRI (2006), Table 4 shows how these standards can\

    \ vulnerabilities \nSource: Based on EPRI, 2006. \nWired Ethernet is the prevalent\
    \ LAN technology today. Customers’ sites can be connected via \nEthernet with\
    \ WAN or other networks. Due to its wide use, it has important market support,\
    \ multiple \ndifferent products are available and costs are relatively low (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). However, it is a local area \nnetwork technology only. \nIn-building\
    \ power line communications: The two most common technologies in this area are\
    \ Home \nPlug and X10 (EPRI, 2006). Home Plug is a broadband over power line (BPL)\
    \ system that provides a bit \nrate of approximately 14 Mbps (The Power Alliance,\
    \ 2009b). It is suited for applications requiring Quality \nof Service (QoS) with\
    \ four different levels of priority. Further, encryption mechanisms are available.\
    \ It can \nbe deployed to connect equipment at customers’ site. Newer versions\
    \ also support advanced portal \napplications such as entertainment delivery (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). Strengths of the Home Plug network include \nconnectivity to home wiring\
    \ and QoS features (EPRI, 2006). The main shortcoming is the lack of standards\
    \ \nboth at the national and international level. Currently, the Home Plug Alliance\
    \ that promotes Home Plug \nworks together with the ZigBee Alliance and EPRI define\
    \ a Smart Energy Standard for consumer \napplications (The Home Plug Alliance,\
    \ 2009a). \nX10 “is the earliest, and probably the most popular, power-line carrier\
    \ system for home automation” \nand a “convenient mechanism for a portal to control\
    \ load equipment (e.g. thermostats, pool pumps)” \n(EPRI, 2006). Strengths include\
    \ the common use implying that multiple equipments are compatible with \nX10 and\
    \ low implementation costs if devices already use power lines (EPRI, 2006). However,\
    \ it cannot be \nused as a general purpose LAN. Further, it is a de facto standard\
    \ only and there is no open access to the \nprotocol (EPRI, 2006).  \nOverall,\
    \ defining a smart grid’s communication backbone at the early stage including\
    \ different \nnetwork technologies is paramount for the interoperability of different\
    \ devices. If not done properly at an \nearly stage, sub-projects “may have to\
    \ be retrofitted later to accommodate the eventual communication \n18 - SMART\
    \ SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n18\
    \ \nstandards, adding greatly to time and expense” (Shargal and Houseman, 2009a).\
    \ At this stage of \ndevelopment, a compilation of information regarding the success\
    \ or failure of electricity service providers \nin their choices for the communication\
    \ backbone to their smart grid will be invaluable. This will, for \nexample, help\
    \ telecommunications regulators to work out what kind of investment in national\
    \ broadband \ninfrastructures will help to achieve the aims of building smart\
    \ infrastructures.6  \nProgrammes for decision support and human interfaces \n\
    Another key component area of the smart grids comprises programmes for decision\
    \ support and \nhuman interfaces. The data volume in smart grids will increase\
    \ tremendously compared to traditional grids. \nAs Houseman and Shargal (2009)\
    \ suggest, “a utility with five million customers […] will have more data \nfrom\
    \ their distribution grid than Wal-Mart gets from all of its stores, and Wal-Mart\
    \ manages the world’s \nlargest data warehouse”. One of the main challenges of\
    \ utilities is thus on the one hand the integration and \nmanagement of the generated\
    \ data and on the other hand making the data available to grid operators and \n\
    managers in a user-friendly manner to support their decisions.  \nTools and applications\
    \ include systems based on artificial intelligence and semi-autonomous agent \n\
    software, visualisation technologies, alerting tools, advanced control and performance\
    \ review applications \n(SAIC, 2006) as well as data and simulation applications\
    \ and geospatial information systems (GIS). \nArtificial intelligence methods\
    \ as well as semi-autonomous agent software, for example, contribute to \nminimise\
    \ data volume “and to create a format most effective for user comprehension” whereby\
    \ the \nsoftware has features that learn from input and adapts (SAIC, 2006). New\
    \ methods of visualisation enable \nintegration of data from different sources,\
    \ providing information on the status of the grid and power quality \nand rapid\
    \ information on instabilities and outages. Finally, geographic information systems\
    \ provide \ngeographic, spatial and location information and tailor this information\
    \ to the specific requirements for \ndecision support systems along the smart\
    \ grid. \nAdvanced control systems \nAdvanced control systems constitute the last\
    \ group of the smart grids’ key components. They monitor \nand control essential\
    \ elements of the smart grid. Computer-based algorithms allow efficient data collection\
    \ \nand analysis, provide solutions to human operators and are also able to act\
    \ autonomously (SAIC, 2006). \nFor example, new substation automation systems\
    \ have been developed that provide local information and \nthat can also be monitored\
    \ remotely. Whereas the substation information is only available locally in \n\
    traditional smart grids, new developed subsystems are capable of making this information\
    \ available in the \nwhole grid and thus provide better power management. Faults\
    \ can be detected much faster than in \ntraditional grids and outage times can\
    \ be reduced.  \nThe environmental impact of smart grids \nStudies which aim at\
    \ quantifying the environmental impacts of smart grids typically only quantify\
    \ \npositive impacts. Currently there is a lack of data which quantifies the negative\
    \ footprint of ICT \ninfrastructure involved in smart grids. In the following\
    \ section three studies that examine the CO2e (CO2 \nequivalent)7 abatement potential\
    \ of smart grids are discussed (see Table 5).  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ study (2008) evaluates the opportunity of smart grids by both presenting a case\
    \ study for \nIndia and by quantifying global positive impacts. According to the\
    \ study, power losses in India accounted \nfor 32% of total power production in\
    \ 2007. Currently, utilities are not able to detect where the losses occur \n\
    in the traditional grids. ICT platforms with remote control systems, energy accounting\
    \ and smart meters \ncould have tremendous effects as they would allow utilities\
    \ to track the sources of losses. Further, India \nmainly relies on coal-based\
    \ energy supply to meet increasing demand. Decentralised energy generated by \n\
    renewable energy sources could be integrated in a smart grid. Smart grids would\
    \ thus help to address two \nmajor needs of Indian energy providers: stemming\
    \ losses and reducing carbon intensity.  \nFor the quantification of the positive\
    \ impact, the study assesses four levers that have the potential to \nreduce CO2e\
    \ emissions: i) reduced transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, ii) integration\
    \ of renewable \nenergy sources, iii) reduced consumption through user information,\
    \ and iv) demand side management \n(DSM). The study identifies total emission\
    \ savings of 2.03 GtCO2e in 2020 in a “Business as Usual” \n(BAU)8 scenario. Figure\
    \ 7 shows the contribution of each lever as well as the assumptions behind the\
    \ \ncalculations. Assumptions are based on expert interviews. It should be noted\
    \ that the GeSI estimates of the \noverall CO2e emissions for the year 2020 are\
    \ based on the global CO2e emission data published by the \nIPCC (Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change)9 which are higher than IEA estimates, for example.\
    \  \nWhereas the GeSI Smart Grid study assesses the positive environmental impact\
    \ on a global level in \n2020, EPRI (2008) focuses on the positive environmental\
    \ impacts on a national level in the United States \nfor the year 2030. Another\
    \ difference is the extended view on levers leading to a positive impact: overall,\
    \ \nthe study evaluates seven levers: i) continuous commissioning for commercial\
    \ buildings, ii) reduced line \nlosses, iii) enhanced demand response and (peak)\
    \ load control, iv) direct feedback on energy usage, v) \nenhanced measurement\
    \ and verification capabilities, vi) facilitation of integration of renewable\
    \ resources, \nand vii) facilitation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)\
    \ market penetration. PHEV are “hybrid \nelectric vehicles that can be plugged\
    \ into electrical outlets for recharging” (EPRI, 2008). As PHEV allow \nfor CO2\
    \ emission savings,10 the study attributes 10-20% of these savings to the smart\
    \ grid as the smart \ngrids allow charging of vehicles over night. However, R&D\
    \ on PHEV is still at an early stage. As the study \nevaluates CO2e emission savings\
    \ for a longer time horizon than the GeSI study, the inclusion of PHEV can \n\
    be regarded as useful. However, the percentage of emission savings from PHEV attributed\
    \ to smart grids \nseems potentially overstated. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ is between the low-end value of 60 million tons and the high-end value of \n\
    211 million tons. CO2e emission savings vary considerably. This is due to different\
    \ shares of market \npenetration. Furthermore, estimations are partially based\
    \ on simple assumptions as well as on data from \nsingle cases.  \nThe third study\
    \ discussed in this section assesses both positive and negative impacts of ICTs\
    \ on \nenvironmental sustainability (IPTS, 2004). As opposed to the above studies,\
    \ it studies one important lever: \nthe contribution of renewable energy sources\
    \ to a reduction of CO2 emissions and especially the impact of \nICTs on the share\
    \ of renewable energy sources. ICTs facilitate the integration of energy which\
    \ was \ngenerated by renewable energy sources. According to the authors, the use\
    \ of ICTs in the smart grid \nincreases the total share of renewable energy sources\
    \ in the range of 2-7% in 2020. The range is due to best \nand worst-case values\
    \ for three different scenarios as shown in Table 6. A total reduction in GHG\
    \ \nemissions (measured in CO2e) due to the use of ICTs in energy supply ranges\
    \ from 1.5% in the worst case \nand 3.1% in the best case. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\

    \ the electricity mix changes which directly affects overall CO2e emissions. The\
    \ \nauthors also argue that ICTs enhance combined heat and power generation which\
    \ further leads to a \ndecreased use of fossil fuel. According to the study, the\
    \ impact of smart grid ICTs will be 1.5-3.1% of total \nCO2e reductions in 2020.\
    \ Rebound effects which arise from a higher efficiency in energy supply are \n\
    included in the IPTS study, which is not the case for the GeSI and EPRI studies.\
    \ In terms of scenario \nbuilding, validation measures and the integration of\
    \ positive and negative effects, the IPTS study is the \nmost sophisticated presented\
    \ in this section. It is also the only study which integrates rebound effects.\
    \  \nComparing actual CO2e emission values is a difficult task as the conception\
    \ of these studies differs \nsignificantly. They assess different smart grid levels\
    \ on different continents for differing time horizons. \nOverall, all studies\
    \ emphasise that fully and properly deployed smart grids could have an important\
    \ and \nstrong potential to reduce future CO2e emissions. The GeSI study, for\
    \ example, which assesses the \nenvironmental impacts of several smart (sensor)\
    \ applications, attributes the highest potential to smart grids \nto reduce CO2e\
    \ emissions.  \nHowever, it may be also necessary to investigate the potential\
    \ negative environmental impact \nassociated with the deployment of smart grids,\
    \ for example, the amounts of additional hardware needed to \nsupport and improve\
    \ the electric transmission grid. These new activities may also require new rights\
    \ of \nway and distribution systems with possible negative impacts on wildlife\
    \ and ecosystems. \nBecause of the potential positive impacts of smart grids,\
    \ many OECD countries have emphasised the \ntransformation of actual grids into\
    \ smart grids. For example, the provisions of the U.S. stimulus bill signed \n\
    in February 2009 include USD 11 billion for “smart grid” investments. Furthermore,\
    \ some OECD \ncountries (Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) have\
    \ already issued mandates for smart \nmetering, and the EU Communication on ICTs\
    \ and the environment (13 March 2009) emphasises the role \nof smart metering.\
    \ \n24 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH\
    \  \n \n \n24 \nOne of the main questions for successful implementation of smart\
    \ grids will be whether energy \nsuppliers can agree on working together to adopt\
    \ industry-wide solutions and developing and adopting \nopen standards (Adam,\
    \ Wintersteller, 2008). \nSmart buildings \nIntroduction, definition and main\
    \ components \nSmart buildings are a field closely linked to smart grids. Smart\
    \ buildings rely on a set of technologies \nthat enhance energy-efficiency and\
    \ user comfort as well as the monitoring and safety of the buildings. \nTechnologies\
    \ include new, efficient building materials as well as information and communication\
    \ \ntechnologies (ICTs). An example of newly integrated materials is a second\
    \ façade for glass sky scrapers. \nThe headquarters of the New York Times Company\
    \ has advanced ICT applications as well as a ceramic \nsunscreen consisting of\
    \ ceramic tubes which reflect daylight and thus prevent the skyscraper from \n\
    collecting heat (see Box 1).  \n ICTs are used in: i) building management systems\
    \ which monitor heating, lighting and ventilation, ii) \nsoftware packages which\
    \ automatically switch off devices such as computers and monitors when offices\
    \ \nare empty (SMART, 2020) and iii) security and access systems. These ICT systems\
    \ can be both found at \nhousehold and office level. Furthermore, according to\
    \ Sharpels et al., (1999), first-, second- and third-\ngeneration smart building\
    \ systems can be distinguished.11 First-generation smart buildings are composed\
    \ of \nmany stand-alone self-regulating devices which operate independently from\
    \ each other. Examples include \nsecurity and HVAC systems. In second-generation\
    \ smart buildings, systems are connected via specialised \nnetworks which allow\
    \ them to be controlled remotely and “to facilitate some central scheduling or\
    \ \nsequencing” (Sharpels et al., 1999), e.g. switching off systems when rooms\
    \ and offices are not occupied. \nThird-generation smart building systems are\
    \ capable of learning from the building and adapting their \nmonitoring and controlling\
    \ functions. This last generation is at an early stage. \nSensors and sensor networks\
    \ are used in multiple smart building applications. These include:  \n \nHeating,\
    \ ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) \n \nLightning  \n \nShading\
    \ \n \nAir quality and window control \n \nSystems switching off devices \n\
     \nMetering (covered in the section on smart grids) \n \nStandard household\
    \ applications (e.g. televisions, washing machines) \n \nSecurity and safety\
    \ (access control). \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 25 \n \n25 \nCeramic rods (Source: VorapatInkarojrit)\n \n\
    \ \nBox 1: The New York Times Building - a Smart Building \nThe headquarters of\
    \ the New York Times is an example of how different smart building technologies\
    \ can be \ncombined to reduce energy consumption and to increase user comfort.\
    \ Overall, the building consumes 30% less \nenergy than traditional office skyscrapers.\
    \  \nOpened in November 2007 and designed by Renzo \nPiano, the building has a\
    \ curtain wall which serves as a \nsunscreen and changes colour during the day.\
    \ This wall \nconsists of ceramic rods, “a supporting structure for the \nscreen\
    \ and an insulated window unit” (Hart, 2008).  \nThe building is further equipped\
    \ with lighting and \nshading control systems based on ICT technologies. The \n\
    lighting system ensures that electrical light is only used when \nrequired. Further\
    \ daylighting measures include a garden in the \ncentre of the ground floor which\
    \ is open to the sky as well as a \nlarge area skylight. The electrical ballasts\
    \ in the lighting system are equipped with chips that allow each ballast to be\
    \ \ncontrolled separately. The shading system tracks the position of the sun and\
    \ relies on a sensor network to \nautomatically actuate the raising and lowering\
    \ of the shades. Experience had shown that if it were up to employees \nsitting\
    \ next to the windows to control the shades, “the shades would likely be down\
    \ most of the time since occupants” \nwere “often too busy to manage the shades”\
    \ (LBNL, 2009).  \nThe high-tech HVAC system is equipped with sensors that measure\
    \ the temperature. It is further able to rely on \nfree air cooling, i.e. fresh\
    \ air on cool mornings is brought into the HVAC system. An automated building\
    \ system \nmonitors in parallel “the air conditioning, water cooling, heating,\
    \ fire alarm, and generation systems” (Siemens, 2008). \nThe system relies on\
    \ a large-scale sensor network composed of different kinds of sensors which deliver\
    \ real-time \ninformation. Consequently, energy can be saved as only as few systems\
    \ are turned on as needed.  \nSources: Hart (2008), Siemens (2008), The New York\
    \ Times Building (2009), LBNL (2009). \nSensors embedded in HVAC systems, for\
    \ example, monitor the temperature and the status of parts of \nthe buildings\
    \ such as open or closed windows. In the field of air quality, new gas sensors,\
    \ micro electrical-\nmechanical systems (MEMS), measure the content of CO2 in\
    \ rooms. These relatively new types of sensors \nare made of “silicon chips and\
    \ an oxidizing layer” (Siemens, 2008c). Overall, different types of sensors for\
    \ \nsmart buildings include: \n \nTemperature sensors and heat detectors \n\
    \ \nLight level detectors \n \nMovement and occupancy sensors  \n \nSmoke and\

    \ air quality \nand occupancy sensors at 30% compared to buildings with traditional\
    \ automation technology. The \nfollowing section provide an overview of different\
    \ impact studies focusing on total smart building and \nfacility management systems\
    \ and their energy consumption and emissions. \nThe environmental impact of smart\
    \ buildings \nOnly a few studies on the environmental impact of smart buildings\
    \ cover more than single \napplications and more than one country. In the following\
    \ studies, GeSI (2008) focuses on positive impacts, \nwhereas the IPTS study (2004)\
    \ covers both positive and negative impacts (see Table 5). \nAccording to GeSI\
    \ estimations (2008), buildings will emit 11.7 GtCO2e worldwide in 2020 which\
    \ \nequals 22.5% of total emissions. This includes private households, public\
    \ buildings and offices. The study \nidentifies an ICT-enabled abatement potential\
    \ of 1.68 GtCO2e in a BAU scenario. This abatement potential \nresults both from\
    \ levers that can be attributed to sensors and sensor networks and further levers.\
    \ Figure 9 \nprovides an overview of impacts. Levers which include a positive\
    \ impact of sensors and sensor technology \nare highlighted in blue solid shading.\
    \ These levers account for 59.5% of total CO2e savings. Most \nimportant impact\
    \ levers include savings due to efficient building management systems and savings\
    \ \nresulting from voltage optimisation as well as HVAC systems. Other impacts\
    \ which cannot directly be \nattributed to sensors have diagonal lines.  \n \n\

    \ (2004) covers the environmental impact of smart buildings in the field of facility\
    \ \nmanagement where ICT contributes to energy savings. Facility management “targets\
    \ space heating, water \nheating, cooling, lighting, cooking and electrical appliances”\
    \ (IPTS, 2004).  \nResults of the IPTS study are illustrated in Table 9. With\
    \ the projected development of ICT, \nreductions in energy consumption range from\
    \ 3.5% in the worst case to 7.1% in the best case in 2020. \nConsequently, ICT\
    \ in facility management contributes to CO2e emissions savings ranging from 3.5%\
    \ in the \nworst case to 6.5% in the best case. Overall, an important reduction\
    \ of energy consumption as well as CO2e \nemissions is observed in all scenarios\
    \ with scenario B having the highest energy and emission savings. \n \nSMART SENSOR\

    \ the pivotal role of governments in attaining significant reductions in both\
    \ \nenergy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. They recommend different\
    \ measures to promote the \nuse of ICTs in smart buildings. These measures include\
    \ demonstration projects with best practice \nexamples, minimum standards of energy\
    \ efficiency for existing and new buildings, economic incentives, \ninvestments\
    \ in R&D as well as providing a setting where governments and other stakeholders\
    \ exchange \nresults on different energy-efficiency measures.  \nTo date, several\
    \ programmes have already been set up to promote increased energy efficiency in\
    \ \nbuildings such as CASBEE (Japan) or LEED in the United States. Furthermore,\
    \ the IEA aims at \nconstructing “the world’s leading database on efficiency codes\
    \ and standards for buildings” for comparison \npurposes (IEA G8 Gleneagles programme,\
    \ 2008). \nTransport and logistics \nIntroduction and overview of applications\
    \ \nInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) and sensor networks in particular\
    \ have the \npotential to contribute to increased efficiency in both freight and\
    \ passenger transport as well as a potential \nreduction of overall transportation.\
    \ On the one hand, increased use of ICTs can avoid freight and passenger \ntransport\
    \ through a higher degree of virtualisation, digitisation and teleworking. Digital\
    \ content is delivered \nelectronically and virtual conferences and teleworking\
    \ reduce passenger transport. On the other hand, \nincreased use of ICTs can contribute\
    \ to better management of transport routes and traffic, higher safety, \ntime\
    \ and cost savings as well as reductions of CO2 emissions.  \nSensors and sensor\
    \ networks play a vital role in the increase of transport efficiency. For example,\
    \ \nsensor technology contributes to better tracking of goods and vehicles which\
    \ might result in lower level of \ninventories and thus energy savings from less\
    \ inventory infrastructure as well as a reduced need for \n30 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\
    \ TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n30 \ntransportation\
    \ (Atkinson, Castro, 2008). Furthermore, sensors and sensor networks are pivotal\
    \ parts of \nmany intelligent transportation systems (ITS).  \nAn intelligent\
    \ transportation system (ITS) can be defined as “the application of advanced and\
    \ \nemerging technologies (computers, sensors, control, communications, and electronic\
    \ devices) in \ntransportation to save lives, time, money, energy and the environment”\
    \ (ITS Canada, 2009). The ITS can \nbe categorised into intelligent infrastructure\
    \ and intelligent vehicles (RITA, 2009). Figure 10 gives an \noverview of different\
    \ ITS applications for both intelligent infrastructure and intelligent vehicles\
    \ as well as \nsome examples for each application.  \nMany of these applications\
    \ are based on sensors and sensor networks. In the field of intelligent \ninfrastructure\
    \ sensors in pavements are used for road traffic monitoring systems to measure\
    \ the intensity \nand fluidity of traffic (vehicle count sensors) and to provide\
    \ information for traffic lights which are then \ncontrolled. These sensors are\
    \ further able to detect whether, for example, public buses are approaching so\
    \ \nthat the green phase of traffic lights can be extended, allowing buses to\
    \ keep their schedules (Veloso, \nBento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). They also transmit\
    \ information to update public transport panels. New \nsensor applications include\
    \ intermittent bus lanes (see Box 3). In addition, sensors are used for motorway\
    \ \ntolling purposes where they detect vehicle RFID tags and retrieve the required\
    \ information (Veloso, Bento, \nCâmara Pereira, 2009). Sensors also monitor the\
    \ state of physical infrastructures such as bridges by \ndetecting “vibrations\
    \ and displacements” (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). \nFigure 10: Overview\

    \ Sensors\nIntelligent Vehicles\n \nSource: OECD based on RITA, 2009 and Alberta\
    \ Transportation, 2009. \nIntelligent vehicles are equipped with sensors for multiple\
    \ purposes. Examples for different kinds of \nvehicles include: i) Trains in metros,\
    \ especially driverless systems, use sensors to control the velocity and \nlocation\
    \ of trains as well as stops at metro stations (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira,\
    \ 2009). ii) Buses rely on \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 31 \n \n31 \ndoor sensors to detect whether doors are open\
    \ to better locate them. Further applications include \nenvironmental sensors\
    \ on buses and tramways that detect weather conditions, analyse traffic conditions\
    \ \nand give alerts via on-board mini-computers (MORYNE FP6 Project, 2008); for\
    \ applications in cars iii), \ncurrent research projects focus on vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication based on data gathered by sensors \n(see for example EU projects\
    \ such as Coopers and PReVent). These (environmental) sensors collect \ninformation,\
    \ for instance, on the location of the car, the speed and road and weather conditions.\
    \ As cars \npass each other, they are able to exchange the summarised information.\
    \ Based on a detailed description of \nthe environment, cars obtain traffic information\
    \ and drivers are able to plan their routes more efficiently. In \naddition, trajectories\
    \ of vehicles can be predicted resulting in a sophisticated risk assessment and\
    \ thus \nincreased traffic safety as drivers can be warned of dangerous driving\
    \ conditions. A further example of car \nsensors is a tyre pressure monitoring\
    \ system which delivers real time tyre pressure information to the \ndriver (Intelligent\
    \ Car Initiative, 2008). Besides improving safety, the system helps to “reduce\
    \ the amount \nof emissions released into the atmosphere” (Intelligent Car Initiative,\
    \ 2008). \n \nBox 3: Intermittent bus lanes \nTo allow a better flow and speed\
    \ of public transport, many cities rely on special lanes for buses, taxis and\
    \ \nemergency vehicles. However, this system can be further optimised as, at times,\
    \ the lane is empty and could \ninstead be used for general traffic, especially\
    \ in heavy traffic situations. The idea of the optimised solution is to \nnormally\
    \ open the bus lane for general traffic and to reserve it only when public transport\
    \ is approaching and when \nthe general traffic is slower than the normal speed\
    \ of public transport.  \nResearchers in Portugal have developed a wireless sensor\
    \ network system which has been tested in Lisbon. \nInstalled lights in the tarmac\
    \ separate the bus lane from other lanes and are only turned on when a bus is\
    \ \napproaching. The presence of public transport in the bus lane is detected\
    \ by sensors in the ground and can be \nsupported by additional information such\
    \ as data from public transport fleet management systems. This information \n\
    is processed by a control station installed near traffic lights. In recent systems,\
    \ the in-pavement components are \nwirelessly connected to each other and to the\
    \ control station to reduce installation costs. Each module is battery \npowered\
    \ and the batteries are charged by pavement-embedded solar panels (see Silva Girão\
    \ et al. (2006)). \nCommunication is assured via RF transmitters and receivers.\
    \ Overall, the results of trials in Lisbon are encouraging \nas the bus speed\
    \ could be increased and the negative impact on the general traffic flow was low.\
    \ The researchers \nhave recently also worked on upgrades of the system such as\
    \ the detection of intrusion of private transport in the \nbus lane when the lane\
    \ is reserved for public transport, and the incorporation of cameras for law enforcement.\
    \  \nSources: Viegas, Lu, 2005, Silva Girão et al., 2006. \nOverall, ITS systems\
    \ make public and private transport more efficient, and potentially cheaper which\
    \ \nmay increase transport volumes (rebound effect) and the environmental impact\
    \ might thus be negative. \nResults of studies analysing the environmental impact\
    \ of smart transportation are mixed due to this effect, \nin contrast to other\
    \ fields of application. The following paragraphs discuss different results from\
    \ the GeSI \n(2008) and IPTS study (2004) as well as their underlying assumptions.\
    \ As for smart buildings, the GeSI \nstudy (2008) concentrates on the positive\
    \ impacts whereas the IPTS study (2004) covers positive and \nnegative effects,\
    \ including rebound effects (see Table 5 for a description of the studies).12\
    \ \nThe environmental impact of smart transportation \nThe GeSI study (2008) estimates\
    \ an abatement potential of 1.52 GtCO2e worldwide in the field of \nsmart transport\
    \ (see Figure 11). As for the field of smart buildings, levers that can be attributed\
    \ to sensors \nand sensor networks and further levers constitute the overall abatement\
    \ potential. Levers that can include a \npositive impact of sensors and sensor\
    \ networks are marked in blue solid shading in Figure 11, other levers \nhave\
    \ diagonal lines. According to GeSi (2008), the most important levers include\
    \ the optimisation of \nlogistic networks and optimised collection and delivery\

    \ and flexible and, as a consequence, cheaper, “leading to a \nfull rebound effect”\
    \ (IPTS 2004). The demand for transportation increases and creates more transport\
    \ \nleading to higher consumption of energy and to growing greenhouse gas emissions.\
    \ According to the \nauthors “higher transport efficiency is the key ICT effect\
    \ increasing freight transport in 2020. This increase \nis in the range of 12%\
    \ to 28%” (IPTS, 2004) for freight transport and of 5-7% for passenger transport.\
    \ \nAlthough the increasing impact of ITS with the projected development of ICTs\
    \ is significantly higher for \nscenario B, the absolute freight transport volume\
    \ is the lowest one in this scenario as environmental costs \nare already internalised\
    \ (see the fourth IPTS interim report (Hilty et al., 2004)). \nIn the field of\
    \ passenger transport, the increased time efficiency of passenger transport implies\
    \ that a \nhigher passenger transport volume can be attained in the same time\
    \ which raises traffic performance. \nHowever, “ICT can slow the growth of private\
    \ car passenger transport, avoiding 10-19% of future car \ntraffic, despite the\
    \ fact that it stimulates the growth of total passenger transport” (IPTS, 2004)\
    \ due to better \ntime utilisation. This time utilisation effect is supposed to\
    \ increase the use of public transport in the modal \nsplit as ICTs can contribute\
    \ to a more effective use of travel time to work. The attractiveness of public\
    \ \ntransport can thus be increased and promote a shift from private cars to public\
    \ transport. However, this \neffect also “relaxes the time budget and therefore\
    \ enables more traffic” (IPTS, 2004).  \nIn the field of freight transport, the\
    \ full rebound effect which results from cheaper transport shows that \nfreight\
    \ transport is “highly sensitive to fuel prices”. Raising fuel prices and thus\
    \ internalising \nenvironmental costs could thus reduce demand significantly.\
    \  \nOverall, this overview of the GeSI and the IPTS studies shows mixed results\
    \ of the impact of \nintelligent transport systems due to rebound effects. These\
    \ effects also highlight that governments can have \na crucial role in the field\
    \ of smart transportation. As the IPTS study shows, increased efficiency of \n\
    transportation should be paralleled with demand-side management. Internalisation\
    \ of environmental effects \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 35 \n \n35 \nby raising energy and fuel prices or the inclusion\
    \ of transportation in emission trading could reduce \ndemand for transport and\
    \ thus reduce CO2e emissions (IPTS, 2004). Furthermore, governments can make \n\
    use of ITS in public transport to render it more attractive and promote a modal\
    \ shift from private cars to \npublic transport. Measures not only include promoting\
    \ a better working environment during travel through \nICTs but also better services\
    \ such as real-time time-table information and optimised route planning.  \nIndustrial\
    \ applications  \nIntroduction and application examples \nThe industry sector\
    \ is an important emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. According to GeSi (2008),\
    \ it \nwas responsible for 23% of total emissions in 2002 and used nearly half\
    \ of all global electricity. Sensors \nand especially sensor networks are used\
    \ in multiple ways in industrial applications. They enable real-time \ndata sharing\
    \ on industrial processes, on the “health state” of equipment and the control\
    \ of operating \nresources to increase industrial efficiency, productivity and\
    \ reduce energy usage and emissions.  \nAs the variety of different sensor applications\
    \ is immense across industry sectors,16 this section \ndescribes three examples\
    \ of industrial fields of application of sensors for: i) process control, ii)\
    \ control of \n(physical) properties during the production process, and iii) equipment\
    \ management and control.  \nIn the field of process control, sensor and sensor\
    \ networks deliver real-time data on the production \nprocess and are able to\
    \ detect in situ variations in the process. Control can thus be moved from the\
    \ finished \nproduct after the completed production run to the production process\
    \ itself (DOE, 2007). Faults can be \nminimised reducing the percentage of deficient\
    \ and reprocessed goods. Furthermore, a continuous \nmonitoring of processes allows\
    \ for efficient use of energy during production processes. An application \nexample\
    \ in the field of process control is an on line laser-ultrasonic thickness gauge\
    \ which measures the \nthickness of steel tube walls under harsh conditions in\
    \ mills. During production, it ensures that “tube walls \nare uniform and reduces\
    \ the need to remove excess material from the walls of the tubes”. As a \nconsequence,\
    \ product consistency can be improved and material saved while “reducing the time\
    \ and \nenergy used during production” (DOE, 2004).  \nIn the field of the control\
    \ of physical properties during production processes, sensors and sensor \nnetworks\
    \ measure different properties as well as the amount of available resources during\
    \ production. This \nallows them to be employed in an efficient and thus precise\
    \ manner resulting in energy savings and the \nreduction of pollutants. Examples\
    \ are sensors measuring the temperature and composition of combustion \ngases\
    \ and sensors measuring the concentration of hydrogen gas (DOE, 2007).  \nIn the\
    \ third field, equipment management and control, sensors monitor the “health of\
    \ machines” as \nwell as their usage. Sensors installed on different machines\
    \ measure physical properties such as \ntemperature, pressure, humidity or vibrations\
    \ (Verdone, 2008). The sensor nodes are able to communicate \nbetween each other\
    \ and send data to the network where the data is processed. When critical values\
    \ are \nachieved, the system immediately sends signals making predictive maintenance\
    \ possible. This intelligent \nmaintenance monitors the functionality of parts\
    \ and ensures that they are replaced based on a degradation \nassessment rather\
    \ than on replacement rules. Besides health monitoring, sensors also control motors\
    \ during \nusage. Motors running at full capacity regardless of load can be inefficient\
    \ and waste energy (GeSi, 2008). \nSensors allow the motor to adjust the power\
    \ usage according to the required output. Wireless networks that \nlink different\
    \ sensors make machine-to-machine communication possible and have the potential\
    \ to increase \nenergy efficiency in whole factories (GeSi, 2008).  \nAs the examples\
    \ have shown, many specific and niche sensor applications are used in factories.\
    \ \nConsequently, interoperability of different systems becomes a crucial issue\
    \ to connect different sensor \n36 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n36 \nsystems and to maximise efficiency and energy\
    \ savings. Some standards have already been launched such \nas the interface IEEE\
    \ 1451 group of standards which aims at enabling plug-and-play of different sensors\
    \ \nand sensor networks (Chong, Kumar, 2003).  \nAn example of the environmental\
    \ impact of smart industrial applications  \nThere is so far little information\
    \ on the overall environmental impact of sensors and sensor networks \nacross\
    \ different fields of industrial applications. GeSi (2008) assessed the impact\
    \ of one major industrial \nfield of application: smart motor systems. The study\
    \ focuses on positive impacts (for a description of the \nstudy, see Table 5).\
    \ In the following, the results of this analysis are discussed to give an example\
    \ of the \nenvironmental impact of smart industrial applications.  \nAccording\
    \ to GeSi (2008) motor systems account for 65% of total energy use by industry.\
    \ Smart \nmotors which adjust power consumption to outputs can have an important\
    \ role in reducing this demand. \nThe authors of the study estimate a worldwide\
    \ abatement potential of 970 MtCO2e in a BAU scenario (see \nFigure 12). This\
    \ is, on the one hand, due to an optimisation of motors’ speed (abatement potential\
    \ of 680 \nMtCO2e) and, on the other hand, to ICT-driven automation (abatement\
    \ potential of 290 MtCO2e). \nFigure 12: Positive environmental impact of smart\

    \ technology has an important impact on energy and \ngreenhouse gas emission savings\
    \ for industrial automation and control. These savings can be especially \nhigh\
    \ when different sensors and sensor networks communicate with each other. Besides\
    \ the use of sensor \ntechnology, sound process planning, for example with process\
    \ optimisation tools, also play an important \nrole. Various initiatives have\
    \ been created such as Motor Decision Matters,17 and Work Energy Smart18 \nwhich\
    \ not only focus on technology but also on process planning and improvement. \
    \ \nPrecision agriculture and animal tracking \nSensors and sensor networks are\
    \ important components of precision agriculture which aims at \n“maximum production\
    \ efficiency with minimum environmental impact” (Taylor and Whelan, 2005). Land\
    \ \nover-exploitation, one of the major concerns of intensive agriculture, leads\
    \ to problems such as soil \ncompaction, erosion, salinity and declining water\
    \ quality (Wark et al., 2007). Sensors and sensor networks \nplay a critical role\
    \ in measuring and monitoring the health of the soil and water quality at various\
    \ stages, \nfrom pre- to post-production. In the field of animal tracking, the\
    \ movement of herds, the health of animals \nand the state of the pasture can\
    \ be controlled via sensor networks. So far a number of sensor network \nsystems\
    \ have been developed and trials and field experiments are under way. However,\
    \ concrete \napplications are at an early stage. This section briefly describes\
    \ applications of sensor networks in \nprecision agriculture and animal production.\
    \ Subsequently, environmental impacts are presented \nqualitatively rather than\
    \ quantitatively due to the early application stage. \nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ sensor networks can be used for: i) plant/crop monitoring, ii) soil monitoring,\
    \ \niii) climate monitoring and iv) insect-disease-weed monitoring.  \nIn the\
    \ field of plant/crop monitoring, wireless sensors have been developed to gather,\
    \ for example, \ndata on leaf temperature, chlorophyll content and plant water\
    \ status. Based on these data, farmers are able \nto detect problems at an early\
    \ stage and implement real-time solutions. The health and moisture of soil is\
    \ a \nbasic prerequisite for efficient plant and crop cultivation. Sensors contribute\
    \ to real-time monitoring of \nvariables such as soil fertility, soil water availability\
    \ and soil compaction. Further, sensor nodes which \ncommunicate with radio or\
    \ mobile network weather stations provide climate and micro-climate data. \nSensors\
    \ registering the temperature and relative humidity can contribute to detect conditions\
    \ under which \ndisease infestation is likely to occur (see Box 2). \n \n38 -\
    \ SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n\
    \ \n38 \n \n \nBox 2: Monitoring micro-climates in a crop field \nThe LOFAR (Low\
    \ Frequency Array) Agro Project has measured the micro-climate in a potato field\
    \ to provide \ninformation on how a fungal disease, phytophtora, can be combated.\
    \ Its development highly depends on the \nclimatological conditions within the\
    \ field.  \n150 sensor nodes have been deployed in the field for the experiment.\
    \ These nodes are equipped with sensors which \nmeasure both temperature and relative\
    \ humidity (see Figure). Additional sensors are deployed in the soil to monitor\
    \ \nsoil humidity. A weather station “registering the luminosity, air pressure,\
    \ precipitation, wind strength and direction” \n(Baggio, 2005) complements the\
    \ setting.  \n \nSensor nodes send the gathered data via a wireless connection\
    \ every 10 minutes to field gateways which send it to an \nordinary PC for data\
    \ logging (the Lofar gateway in the figure). The data is further transmitted to\
    \ other servers for data \nanalysis via a wired Internet connection. A decision\
    \ support system maps the temperature distribution together with \nother information.\
    \ Based on this information, farmers can take different actions and vary the amount\
    \ of fertilizer and \npesticide used.  \nSource: Baggio (2005). Note that most\
    \ such projects have not yet been scaled-up. \nThe health of pastures can also\
    \ be evaluated through high-resolution remote sensing tools. Healthy \npastures\
    \ usually “have a consistent cover of evenly dispersed perennial vegetation” (Ludwig\
    \ et al., 2008). \nRemotely sensed satellite maps depict the location of persistent\
    \ vegetation cover. Based on this \ninformation and information on the three dimensional\
    \ shape of the landscape, Australian scientists \ncalculate leakiness values and\
    \ their changes over time. As a result, conditions of pastures can be measured\
    \ \nand problematic areas detected (Ludwig et al., 2008). \nWireless sensors are\
    \ further used for precision irrigation, and systems developed for remotely \n\
    controlled, automatic irrigation. Sensors assume, for example, the tasks of irrigation\
    \ control and irrigation \nscheduling using sensed data together with additional\
    \ information, e.g. weather data (Evans and Bergman, \n2003). Finally, sensors\
    \ are used to assist in precision fertilisation. Based on sensor data, decision\
    \ support \nsystems calculate the “optimal quantity and spread pattern for a fertilizer”\
    \ (Wang et al., 2006).  \nWireless sensor networks also contribute to a better\
    \ understanding of the behaviour of cattle, such as \ntheir grazing habits, herd\
    \ behaviour and the interaction with the surrounding environment (Wark et al.,\
    \ \n2007). The information provided by these sensors helps famers to understand\
    \ the state of the pasture and to \nfind optimal ways to use these resources.\
    \ To test sensor applications for cattle management, Wark et al,. \n(2007) attached\
    \ sensor nodes to cattle collars. Sensors communicated in a peer-to-peer fashion.\
    \ Cattle \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH\
    \ – 39 \n \n39 \ncollars pinged each other “with each ping containing an animal’s\
    \ GPS position and time of each ping \ntransmission” (Wark et al., 2007). Based\
    \ on the positioning data of each node and inertial information, the \ncattle’s\
    \ individual and herd behaviour could be modelled and more general models could\
    \ be developed. As \na result, farmers are able to optimally manage environmental\
    \ resources and plan grazing areas to prevent \nenvironmental problems such as\
    \ overgrazing and land erosion. Current work focuses on the integration of \n\
    sensor networks and radio frequency technology (RFID) as a significant number\
    \ of cattle are equipped \nwith RFID tags to record their ID as well as information\
    \ such as cattle characteristics and food \ninformation.  \nThe environmental\
    \ impact of precision agriculture and animal tracking \nThrough the monitoring\
    \ of the soil, climate and plants, a precise irrigation rate can be determined\
    \ \nwhich may lead to a reduced consumption of water. Usually, fields are irrigated\
    \ with uniform amounts of \nwater. However, the variability in a field requires\
    \ different amounts for different areas due to the \ncombination of different\
    \ crops and soil types (USDA, 2007). Various projects have been conducted to \n\
    measure the extent of water savings. Damas et al., (2001), for example, tested\
    \ an automated irrigation \nsystem for a 1500 ha area in Spain, with water savings\
    \ of 30-60%. According to the USDA, another study \nfound water savings of 5.7\
    \ million gallons on 279 acres in 2002 (USDA, 2007). One study by King et al.\
    \ \n(2006) showed no significant water savings for a variable rate irrigation\
    \ system. However, the spatial \nvariability in available water holding capacity\
    \ (AWHC) of the soil was considered the main determinant \ninfluencing crop yield\
    \ and the basis for a site-specific irrigation management (SSIM) system. The authors\
    \ \nacknowledge that the “results from this study and others collectively suggest\
    \ that AWHC may not be the \nbest or only parameter to consider in delineating\
    \ irrigation management zones. A systems approach to \nSSIM will likely be required\
    \ that takes into account all known factors affecting yield [...]” (King et al.,\
    \ \n2006). Overall, the majority of studies showed a reduced consumption of water,\
    \ but that deployment \nshould be based on a thorough analysis of the area being\
    \ irrigated and a comprehensive consideration of \ndifferent factors which affect\
    \ site-specific irrigation. Sensors and sensor networks can significantly \ncontribute\
    \ to this analysis by providing the required data.  \nFurther important benefits\
    \ of precision agriculture are reductions of fertilisers and pesticides. Both\
    \ \nfertiliser and pesticide applications affect surface and groundwater quality,\
    \ the quality of crops, soil \nproperties and non-target species. Through monitoring\
    \ the soil, the micro-climate and crops, it is possible \nto apply only the fertilisers\
    \ and the pesticides crops need. Rates can be varied in real-time within fields\
    \ \nbased on different field and plant properties. Additionally, applications\
    \ can be more precisely controlled in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas (USDA,\
    \ 2007). Finally, a more targeted application of pesticides can \nreduce problems\
    \ of pesticides resistances.  \nIn the field of animal tracking, farmers are able\
    \ to manage grazing areas based on information on herd \nbehaviour. As a consequence,\
    \ overgrazing of pastures as well as land erosion can be avoided. Limited \npasture\
    \ resources can thus be effectively managed. \nOverall, sensors and sensor networks\
    \ significantly contribute to a more sustainable use of natural \nresources. However,\
    \ development of sensors and sensor networks for precision agriculture is in an\
    \ early \nstage and sensor applications tend to be expensive. To date, farmers\
    \ only take economic benefits into \nconsideration when deciding on whether they\
    \ should rely on precision agriculture (USDA, 2007). \nGovernments can help farmers\
    \ to recognise the environmental dimension by pointing out the economic \nbenefits\
    \ of improved soil and pasture quality as well as reduced applications of fertilisers\
    \ and pesticides. \nFurther, precision agriculture can be encouraged through technical\
    \ assistance and conservation \nprogrammes. \n40 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\
    \ AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n40 \nConclusion  \nThis report gives\
    \ an overview of sensor and sensor networks applications and their impact on the\
    \ \nenvironment. It discusses selected fields of application which have a high\
    \ potential to tackle environmental \nchallenges and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\
    \  \nA review of different studies assessing the environmental impact of ICTs\
    \ and especially sensor and \nsensor networks reveals that these technologies\
    \ can contribute significantly to more efficient use of \nresources and an important\
    \ reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Government policies and initiatives are\
    \ \ncrucial in fostering the positive environmental effects of the use of sensors\
    \ and sensor networks in different \nfields and are an essential part of strategies\
    \ to radically improve environmental performance (see also \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)3/FINAL).\
    \ However, rebound effects have to be taken into account, and increased \nefficiency\
    \ due to the use of sensor technology should be paralleled with demand-side management\
    \ which \ninternalises environmental costs, for example by raising CO2 –intensive\
    \ energy and fuel prices. In the field \nof smart buildings, minimum standards\
    \ of energy efficiency can be a major factor in reducing electricity \nuse and\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions.  \nIn general many applications in promising fields\
    \ are still at an early stage of development. Joint R&D \nprogrammes and implementation\
    \ projects can promote the use of sensor technology and contribute to \nindustry-wide\
    \ solutions and the development of open standards. Finally, the use of ICTs and\
    \ especially \nsensor technology is sometimes relatively expensive, for example\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sector in \nterms of farmers’ economic considerations.\
    \ Governments can encourage the use of ICTs and sensor \ntechnology through conservation\
    \ programmes and by accentuating the environmental dimension of ICTs in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN\
    \ GROWTH – 41 \n \n41 \n \nNOTES\n \n1  \nWireless networks have several advantages\
    \ over wired networks: for instance, installation and maintenance \ncosts tend\
    \ to be lower, replacement and upgrading is easier for wireless networks, the\
    \ flexibility of wireless \nsystems is higher and (more recently developed) wireless\
    \ networks have the capability to simply organise \nand configure themselves into\
    \ effective communication networks (see also DOE, 2002). \n2  \nNote that customer\
    \ power inputs into the power system require a separate inverter module and input\
    \ meter. \n3  \nCosts are dependent on the technical infrastructure: e.g. the\
    \ signal must bypass the final transformer from \nthe utility to costumers’ site.\
    \ In the United States, bypassing the final transformer is, for example, much\
    \ \nmore expensive than in Europe as only a small number of customers are connected\
    \ to one final transformer \n(EPRI, 2006).  \n4  \nCosts are dependent on the\
    \ technical infrastructure: e.g. the signal must bypass the final transformer\
    \ from \nthe utility to costumers’ site. In the United States, bypassing the final\
    \ transformer is, for example, much \nmore expensive than in Europe as only a\
    \ small number of customers are connected to one final transformer \n(EPRI, 2006).\
    \ \n5  \nWiMAX can be both grouped to LAN and WAN technologies. It is further\
    \ discussed in the paragraphs on \nwide area networks. \n6  \nSee also DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)2/FINAL\
    \ for broadband investments in smart grids.  \n7  \nA measure often used in quantifying\
    \ emissions is the measure carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) \nemissions. Different\
    \ emissions vary in their warming influence, the radiative forcing, on the climate.\
    \ The \ncommon metric which is used in many studies is the radiative forcing of\
    \ CO2. “The equivalent CO2 \nemission is obtained by multiplying the emission\
    \ of a GHG by its Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the \ngiven time horizon.”\
    \ (IPCC) \n8  \nBusiness as usual (BAU) scenario: a baseline scenario that examines\
    \ the “consequences of continuing \ncurrent trends in population, economy, technology\
    \ and human behaviour” (European Environment Agency, \n2009). \n9  \nIPCC(2007)\
    \ \n10  \nThe extent of the savings depends on the carbon-intensity of overall\
    \ generated electricity. \n11  \nThe authors use the term “intelligent buildings”.\
    \ For this report, smart buildings and intelligent buildings \nare treated as\
    \ synonyms. \n12  \nThe section on the impact of smart logistics does not cover\
    \ the impacts of dematerialisation and \nvirtualisation as sensor and sensor networks\
    \ play a minor role in these fields. \n13  \nThe IPTS study also analyses the\
    \ impact of teleshopping, telework, virtual meeting and virtual goods on \npassenger\
    \ and freight transport. This is not discussed in this study as sensor and sensor\
    \ networks have a \nminor impact in these fields.  \n42 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\

    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 47 \n \n47 \nANNEX A1. \nOTHER FIELDS OF SENSOR AND SENSOR\
    \ NETWORK APPLICATIONS \nEnvironmental monitoring \n \nAs multiple different applications\
    \ exist, the following section will present some examples of \nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ in the following areas: water pollution, air pollution, analysis of global \n\
    warming, as well as facilitated recycling (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).  \nSensor\
    \ networks are deployed in waters to monitor the level of pollution as well as\
    \ the state of marine \nlife. Along the entire Hudson River in New York, scientists\
    \ are installing sensors nodes which will \npartially be suspended from buoys.\
    \ Data is transmitted wirelessly and provides information about current \npollution\
    \ levels.  \nFor air pollution monitoring, sensor networks are deployed within\
    \ cities in order to detect specific \ntimes and locations when pollution peaks.\
    \ Engineers from Harvard University deployed 100 general \npurpose nodes onto\
    \ streetlights to cover the city of Cambridge, L. A. aiming at measuring the amount\
    \ of \nparticles in the air and collecting weather data. The sensors are directly\
    \ powered by the city streetlights and \ncommunicate via Wi-Fi radios (Greene,\
    \ 2007). \nThe analysis and assessment of global warming requires sophisticated\
    \ IT technology to understand to \nwhich extent and why the climate has changed.\
    \ Some applications involve sensor networks. For instance, a \nplane which is\
    \ deployed in the arctic by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\
    \ researchers \nis equipped with 30 airborne sensors and collects “data that can\
    \ be used to produce a detailed simulation of \nthe chain of chemical reactions\
    \ that arctic pollution cause and that increase ice melting” (Atkinson, Castro,\
    \ \n2008). Furthermore, a worldwide sensor network, the Global Earth Observation\
    \ System of Systems \n(GEOSS) is currently being developed with the aim to collect\
    \ data relating to climate change and more \ngenerally air pollution. Currently,\
    \ 76 countries and the European Union participate in the project (GEO, \n2008).\
    \ \nThe final application presented here in the section of environmental monitoring\
    \ is dealing with the \ncollection and recycling of waste. Automatic sorting machines\
    \ are not only equipped with magnets to sort \nout metal objects but also with\
    \ optical sensors. These sensors identify different kinds of plastics and paper\
    \ \nallowing them to be put in different bins. Furthermore, RFID tags with integrated\
    \ sensors on private \nhouseholds’ bins measure the weight of the waste. Costs\
    \ are then allocated according to the weight of the \nwaste during the year. \
    \ \nUrban terrain tracking and civil structure monitoring \n \nThis field of application\
    \ covers the structural health monitoring of large civil or urban structures.\
    \ One \nprominent example is the Ben Franklin Bridge. A network of ten sensors\
    \ monitors the strain of the bridge \nstructure when trains are crossing the bridge.\
    \ Two different operation modes reduce the required power: a \nlow-power sampling\
    \ mode checks if any trains are passing. If this is the case, the strain increases\
    \ and leads \nthe system to switch to a second mode in which samples are collected\
    \ at a higher pace to monitor precisely \nchanges in the strain.  \n48 - SMART\
    \ SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n48\
    \ \nEntertainment \n \nMultiple different and heterogeneous applications are conceivable\
    \ in the entertainment area. \nAccording to Verdone et al. (2008), there are application\
    \ scenarios in which live TV shows react to user \n(emotional) feedback. This\
    \ enables viewers to get more involved in the shows and the provider to adapt\
    \ the \nshows more to the viewers’ needs. Further examples include applications\
    \ in the games area: Via sensor \nnetworks, game players are able to project their\
    \ moods and gestures in the virtual world (Verdone et al. \n2008). \nSecurity\
    \ and surveillance \n \nSecurity and surveillance sensor networks are used in\
    \ the military and defence area, for example for \nthe surveillance of borders.\
    \ In this case, different kinds of sensors are used, ranging from sensors \nmonitoring\
    \ temperature to sensors monitoring light to acoustic sensors. Further, they are\
    \ also employed for \ncivil structure, for instance for fire detection systems\
    \ in buildings. \nHealth care \n \nSensor networks can be and are currently used\
    \ in multiple ways in the healthcare sector. Applications \ncover telemonitoring\
    \ of patients’ state of health, tracking and monitoring the movements of patients\
    \ and \ndoctors, drug administration and diagnostic applications (Heppner, 2007,\
    \ Verdone, 2008). In the field of \npatients’ state of health, sensor networks\
    \ are particularly useful for patients under medical observation. \nSensors communicate\
    \ gathered data to a telecommunication device such as a mobile phone, which further\
    \ \ntransmits the data to nurses’ or doctors’ rooms in case of dangerous changes\
    \ of the state of health. It is also \npossible to carry out medication control\
    \ via these sensors (Heppner, 2007). Sensor networks and location-\nbased services\
    \ allow doctors to be quickly tracked in hospitals in case of emergency. The same\
    \ principle is \napplicable to their patients. Furthermore, wireless sensors are\
    \ developed for implants such as glaucoma \nsensors or intra-cranial pressure\
    \ sensor systems (Healthy Aims, 2008). \n"

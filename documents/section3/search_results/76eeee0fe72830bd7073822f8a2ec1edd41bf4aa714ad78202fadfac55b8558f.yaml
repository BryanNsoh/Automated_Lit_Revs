    Budapest, Hungary SECTION I. Introduction Water is a precious commodity [1]. Consequently,
    agriculture’s traditional irrigation systems, which require a huge amount of water,
    necessitates smart strategies for minimizing the proportion of available water
    wasted for irrigation. Consequently, creating a smart irrigation system is critical
    in the greenhouse environment. Therefore, when compared to traditional technologies,
    new irrigation systems should be utilized in a manner that demands less water
    waste. Smart irrigation implies not only using less water but also optimizing
    water supply based on demand. This method boosts agricultural efficiency and the
    possibility of reducing dangers such as incorrect irrigation scheduling. Such
    systems autonomously analyze weather conditions, plant soil properties, and water
    management using wireless sensors, including local and global network communication
    [1]. These systems should construct of controllers and a wireless sensor network
    that combines ZigBee as a data transmission technology [2], GSM as the main controller
    device, and MQTT as a messaging protocol for communications. The incorporation
    of the aforementioned technologies into irrigation management systems is one method
    of improving irrigation operations to amend water consumption and maximize agricultural
    yields, nevertheless, it has been overlooked in recent research [2]. Moreover,
    the first benefit of local network communication is that it increases the diversity
    of sensors, which has been overlooked in earlier studies. This is advantageous
    because we may enhance the flexibility of managing the greenhouse environment
    without changing the system as well as incurring additional costs. This research
    paper discusses and compares the main wireless communication protocols required
    and recommends alternatives for each to choose the best communication protocols
    for smart irrigation in a greenhouse environment. This paper aims to reduce water
    loss and over/under irrigation to minimize unpleasant shock to crops. The paper’s
    remaining portion is arranged as seen below. The literature review is covered
    in Section II. Section III introduces the fundamental concepts of three types
    of wireless network communications and their components. Furthermore, the tables
    in this part compare several global and local communication protocols for IoT
    systems, with findings and comments provided in section IV. Finally, section V
    represents the research outcomes. SECTION II. Literature Review Numerous experiments
    on agricultural intelligence and greenhouse climate management using ZigBee have
    previously been performed. Others compared various forms of communication protocols,
    as well as their benefits and drawbacks. Reference [3] was the first to demonstrate
    current research on ZigBee wireless sensor systems in industry 4.0, household
    appliances, building automation, and healthcare. Following that, this study introduced
    both hardware and software architecture to present a feasible solution for greenhouse
    management. Furthermore, because the ZigBee star network can only control one
    greenhouse, the layout of a greenhouse ZigBee based on mesh network greenhouse
    management is shown. However, the overall accuracy of this architecture has not
    been investigated in this study, which is not acceptable in smart irrigation.
    We will utilize the star network to manage greenhouse irrigation because the mesh
    network is not profitable to the greenhouse. Similarly [4] employs a low-cost,
    low-power-consumption farm tracking system built on the ZigBee short-distance
    wireless network. Furthermore, the system’s main goal is to regulate the greenhouse’s
    climate, which includes temperature, light, humidity, and C O 2 . Nonetheless,
    it should be noted that the main parameter in agriculture is the reduction of
    overirrigation, which this system has not addressed, even though the world is
    trending toward smart irrigation control. Another work [2] investigates novel
    strategies based on information and communication technology (ICT) for minimizing
    water consumption while also providing faraway control and surveillance of the
    irrigation system in southern Algeria. The following communication protocols were
    used in this study: a messaging protocol (The Constrained Application Protocol-CoAP)
    was utilized to check the soil moisture and water level in the tank using a smartphone
    application, and the scheduling protocol for limited and nonlinear networks was
    implemented to arrange the nodes to overcome the low wattage and highly compressed
    network problem. Nevertheless, the system is fully dependent on the CoAP protocol,
    which does not provide us with complete confidence owing to the UDP transport
    protocol. Thus, an advanced solution for this research will be presented by us,
    which is a less complex messaging protocol called MQTT. Research work on the identification
    of optimal messaging protocols for the IoT network in [5] provides a general comparison
    among these protocols using simple graphs to introduce their characteristics comparatively.
    However, it should be emphasized that graphs generated from the relative comparison
    of protocols are not reliable since this relative comparison may provide different
    comparative findings in different IoT systems with different components. Also,
    this evaluation has not been performed in a greenhouse environment. Another descriptive
    study [6] examines the performance of numerous local communication protocols in
    residence digitalization from the customer viewpoint. According to the study’s
    comparative discussion, Z-Wave was chosen as the preferred home automation wireless,
    technology solution, since it fits all the characteristics of establishing an
    optimal smart home, for example, the convenience of implementation, minimal power
    usage, and accessibility. However, ZigBee with its vast number of nodes and extended
    range should be prioritized over Z-wave, particularly in greenhouse environments
    [7]. SECTION III. Smart Methods of Environmental Control In the Greenhouse To
    control Greenhouse environments, we need to create a local network as wireless
    sensors with short-range wireless communication and a global network to communicate
    between the main controller in the greenhouse and the server side. The aim of
    this research is to give solutions to the accompanying issue statements: What
    wireless networks are ideal for smart greenhouse irrigation? What are the solutions
    for connecting the sensors and the local area with the point-to-point protocol,
    as well as connecting the main board to the global network? How can the server
    access or decide on the operation of greenhouse irrigation? Wireless access choices
    include GSM, LoRa, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee, and Wi-Fi, each having
    its own strange mix of energy, bandwidth, data speeds, reconfigurable, and resilience
    to disturbances. We categorize wireless communication into three groups: global
    network communication, local network communication, and protocol tools between
    the client side and server side. A. Global Network Communication It is located
    between the main controller device and the server. Besides, it supports GSM, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and Lora. 1) GSM: has the most extensive network coverage and the most
    global reach, and it is available in the frequency band of 900 MHz with a frequency
    spectrum of 25 MHz. Likewise, one of the distinguishing aspects of GSM is the
    simultaneous access of multiple users [8]. 2) LTE-M: [4], [9] is a recognized
    wireless technology for next-generation communications. It performs in the authorized
    frequency spectrum, enhancing throughput while minimizing disturbance from other
    devices. Device diversity in each region may be increased by using the cellular
    spectrum and communicating in narrow bands to save energy. The significant expense
    of operation owing to the use of cellular data plans is the major weakness of
    these technologies [10]. 3) Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT): [11] seems
    to be a low-cost, low-power approach for installing massive numbers of linked
    objects. It is designed for a new generation of battery-powered IoT devices that
    are located in remote regions and only need to transfer tiny quantities of data
    on a regular basis [12]. TABLE I Comparison of Global Communication Protocols
    4) Lora: is an abbreviation for “Long Range,” a communication protocol designed
    for low-energy broad area networks to reduce emissions, and broad bandwidth exploitation
    of star and mesh structures to improve power consumption [13]. This protocol can
    also support different data rates depending on application requirements, as well
    as the ability to trade off speed against bandwidth. The primary disadvantage
    of these technologies is that they operate on an unlicensed frequency, making
    them prone to influence from other systems, that they only provide point-to-point
    communications, and that they have limited bandwidth support [9] [10] [14] [15]
    [16]. TABLE II Comparison of Iot Local Communication Protocols 5) Sigfox: network
    was developed in 2009 by a non-profit group that operates in the Internet of Things
    domain and employs this technology in numerous monitoring and security devices.
    Furthermore, any mobility should be restricted during the Sigfox clamp procedure,
    increasing security. A collection of businesses offers Sigfox devices to the general
    public. Encryption is not achievable since terminal devices are not linked to
    a single base station [11]. Which employs unlicensed frequencies. This system
    has provided low-power, long-distance range, moderate-latency, and supporter connection
    [13]. Table I compares global communication protocols. As it could be observed,
    each alternative technique has unique features; hence, selecting and combining
    the best ones should be based on a thorough knowledge of architecture and expectations
    for each target system. B. Local Network Communication The first phase in smart
    irrigation should be to establish a network protocol. It is positioned between
    the sensors and the main controller. ZigBee, Z-wave, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi have
    all been widely accepted wireless technologies for smart irrigation. 1) ZigBee:
    was established for short-range wireless network communication [12]. The network
    layer of ZigBee supports three network configurations: star, mesh, and cluster
    tree. Star systems as ubiquitous and offer extremely saving power. There are three
    types of ZigBee virtual units: Organizers, Controllers, and Network nodes. The
    organizer creates and administers networks, as well as saves network node information.
    By controlling the data between paired nodes, the router contributes to the network.
    The network nodes serve as a network leaf node [3]. 2) Z-Wave: is a moderate Medium
    Access Control protocol that has been utilized for IoT communication, particularly
    in the smart home and small business sectors. It has a range of roughly 30-meters
    and is suited for mildly affected IoT applications such as switches and sensors,
    power management, medical care, and others. Furthermore, it employs a master/slave
    framework in which the master governs the slaves and manages the network’s scheduling
    [17]. 3) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLU): often marketed as wireless connectivity,
    is a wireless technology with a restricted distance, limited network, and high
    throughput that is ideal for IoT areas. The strengths of this protocol include
    minimal energy waste, simplified scheduling, and support for routing network infrastructure
    with an infinite quantity of nodes. Its low energy can be ten times that of ordinary
    Bluetooth, while its latency can be 15 times that of ordinary Bluetooth. [17]
    [18]. 4) Wi-Fi: is another common collection of protocols for establishing and
    improving communication lines. These protocols’ strengths include the capacity
    to convey combined speech and information across vast ranges at quick transaction
    rates, the suitability to manage numerous customer devices with consumer devices
    with a unique core network node, and development to provide encryption support
    for further security [10] [14]. Table II compares local communication methods
    so that we would comprehend the benefits and drawbacks of each in smart irrigation.
    C. Messaging Protocols for IoT systems (Protocol tools between client side and
    server side) 1) Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT): [19] is a Publish/Subscribe
    messaging system developed for lightweight M2M communications that were first
    introduced in 1999 [12]. Every client connects to the host via the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP), which is more dependable and connection-oriented. MQTT
    has a very low latency to transmit, and protocol interactions are minimized to
    decrease network bandwidth [19]. 2) Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): [19]
    is an Internet protocol suite that has formalized the CoAP application layer protocol
    [12]. This is a client/server protocol with a one-to-one interaction model of
    “request/report.” [19]. 3) HTTP: may use a single script to integrate numerous
    resources and services. The important point of IoT is the interoperation offered
    by HTTP; for this, HTTP is used at the application level. Nonetheless, HTTP is
    founded on the TCP protocol and utilizes a peer-to-peer (p2p) communication architecture,
    which is incompatible with notification push systems. Likewise, HTTP is too sophisticated
    for restricted devices [2]. Table III describes three widely recognized messaging
    protocols for IoT devices based on numerous criteria to demonstrate their respective
    properties. TABLE III Comparison of Iot Messaging Protocols SECTION IV. Result
    and Discussion On the one hand, there are several types of water pumps and heaters
    in greenhouses that do not allow us to minimize power consumption. Therefore,
    we do not need to consider power consumption in the greenhouse environment. As
    a result, GSM is the best fit between the main controller and server side. Above
    all, when GSM can give MQTT communication protocol for developing and categorizing
    subjects with data separation, this is perfect for users. Besides, due to GSM’s
    two practical merits, including its worldwide availability and low cost, it may
    be utilized as a global communication protocol in smart greenhouse irrigation
    with more trustworthiness. On the other hand, after evaluating the local communication
    protocols, it is clear, that the ZigBee solution is the right approach for establishing
    an appropriate wireless network connection in the greenhouse environment owing
    to the many nodes, and long-range (maximum 1000 m). Furthermore, in a Zigbee module,
    the strength of connectivity in decibels can reach more than -104db sensitivity.
    (Decibel is a relative unit of measurement. It is commonly used in communications
    to provide a reference for input and output levels). In addition, MQTT is a lightweight,
    high-performance communication protocol that is commonly used in Industrial IoT.
    In terms of MQTT’s supremacy over the other technologies listed, it can be said
    that there are several Quality of Service (QoS) options that may be employed to
    ensure delivery. In other words, QoS benefits include ensuring that the message
    is sent at least once to the receiver, storing the message until it receives a
    PUBACK from the recipient, and allowing messages to be sent or delivered several
    times. Secondly, one of its key advantages is scalability, which implies that
    the publish/subscribe approach scales effectively while being power-efficient.
    Whereas the shortcoming of CoAP is its UDP transport protocol because it does
    not deliver messages. SECTION V. Conclusion This research presents a comparative
    overview of some of the most extensively utilized Global, Local wireless communication
    and messaging protocols for tracking and monitoring smart agricultural irrigation
    systems in a greenhouse environment. The user’s decision of optimal wireless communication
    protocols for smart irrigation is determined by the wireless solution. Meanwhile,
    when compared to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Z-Wave for agricultural systems, ZigBee
    is the right approach if the feature of interest is a large number of nodes, and
    a long range. Form the result of comparing the messaging communication protocols,
    MQTT is recommended smart greenhouse irrigation messaging protocol solution for
    embedded hardware devices compared with CoAP, and HTTP, because of its TCP transport
    protocol, and quality of service (QoS) option. It supports all major operating
    systems and platforms on a software level. Moreover, if universal accessibility
    at a low cost is a concern, GSM is the ideal candidate. As greenhouses are generally
    located outside of cities, GSM coverage is superior to other global communication
    protocols. Authors References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This A reliable

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The main factor for the agriculture is to
    predict the weather, climatic changes and also mainly to predict that when the
    atmosphere conditions are going to change. Here, both the automated irrigation
    system and the IoT is employed for the irrigation monitoring. It will be helpful
    for us when to irrigate the crop or field at what conditions will the crop be
    able to sustain and also the other environment and also the other changes. To
    monitor the weather and climatic conditions which are varying with the time and
    space, so the use of these electrical devices in the agriculture has been increasing
    rapidly. So the use of these WSN technology is applied to the irrigation systems,
    and it automatically removes high risk to the cable line due to the automatic
    operations of the machines [1]. Due to the high cost of the WSN system modules,
    we are not using these type of technology and also it requires high energy for
    the data transmission between the client and server. So we will use the IoT and
    with the help of the IoT we are employing the several systems in the different
    crop fields by naming it as the clients and this clients, which is getting reported
    every time to the server about the status of the crop, climatic changes of the
    temperature, humidity, and also the moisture of the certain place. So that the
    watering and also the when the pesticides can be served based on the conditions
    on the field. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature
    survey. Section 3 explains the proposed system in which the environmental changes
    are controlled using IoT through simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) and message
    queue telemetry transport protocol (MQTT). Section 4 mentions about the hardware
    description. In Sect. 5, results are discussed. Finally, conclusion in Sect. 6.
    2 Literature Survey Wireless sensor network and GPRS module are used in automatic
    irrigation system as shown in Fig. 1. A wireless sensor network in which the required
    parameter sensors are placed in the root zone of the crops. To transmit the information
    received through sensors, it has gate way unit and trigger acculators [2]. To
    know the required amount of water starting values of soil moisture and temperature
    are taken into consideration and algorithm is developed. It uses photovoltaic
    panel and cellular internet communication link for data transference and irrigation
    check. First and foremost, it uses expensive and complex algorithms to get the
    required information. Secondly, it doesn’t help to control the environmental changes
    and low-communication speed. Fig. 1 GPRS module in automated irrigation system
    Full size image 2.1 Smart Phone Irrigation Taking agricultural crops into consideration,
    irrigation sensor was designed. The camera captures the images of the soil and
    roots of the crop to estimate the requirement of water. To estimate the wet and
    dry area of the crop using antireflective glass window an android app was developed
    so that this app activates the device to capture the images. A Wi-Fi connection
    is also needed to control the irrigation as in Fig. 2. This model addresses a
    lot of issues like having a smart phone with a Wi-Fi connection resulting in battery
    issues of phone, poor signal and time consuming. Fig. 2 Smart phone irrigation
    Full size image 2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) To get the best crop conduction,
    increase the productivity WSN is used as in Fig. 3. Many environmental parameters
    are sensed using sensors which continuously sends the data about water shortage.
    The soil conditions, need of water and climatic changes are known by using a Bluetooth
    device [3, 4]. This Bluetooth is used to transfer the information from sender
    to the receiver. Though this model is of low cost and gives the output results,
    it cannot recollect the old data, and it is less secure weather forecasting cloud
    technologies are not used. Fig. 3 Wireless sensor network Full size image 2.3
    IoT in Agriculture IoT has the ability to rule the world in many industries, smart
    cities and especially when it comes to agricultural sector it has a great wallop.
    The conventional based farming approach is too difficult when compared to smart
    farming based IoT [5, 6]. It has great advantages like less water usage, control
    over environment and updated input treatments. It makes stock man and farmers
    to get the useful data, making the farmers understand the process by installing
    the necessary smart ways to increase the productivity as in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IoT
    in agriculture Full size image 2.4 Drone Applications of IoT in Agriculture It
    is one if the best application of today’s growing technology. It handles crop
    health, irrigation, crop records, crop spraying and soil field analysis. Drones
    get the data by insight monitoring and observations [7]. To select a ground resolution
    farmer, enter the data so that plant height measurement, yield prediction and
    so on can be identified. It is used by many organizations and one of the most
    recognized application of IoT agricultural division. It utilizes various sensors,
    control systems, robotics, automated hardware, free vehicles [8]. It adopts high-speed
    internet, mobile devices and low-cost satellites are few technological trends.
    The chance of crops being damaged will be reduced if accuracy of weather is high.
    It is used for food production and safety. Agriculture IoT not only concentrates
    on increasing the productivity of the crop and control of weather conditions but
    also takes responsibility about food security like storage transportation, etc.
    Shipping time, storage temperature and cloud-based records are monitored by this
    system. 3 Proposed System In the present system, we are using the crop field algorithm.
    So the resulting data is having the high accuracy about the environment, and also
    mainly we are using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) instead of
    using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is MQTT is very much faster than the WSN.
    We are using this message queuing telemetry transport to transfer all the information
    about the climatic conditions are processed automatically, like if there is any
    possibility of rain in the weather cloud, then the climatic conditions and also
    the upcoming possibilities of the rain data log and also the current image of
    the environment will also be sent to the users mail. 3.1 Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) Message queuing telemetry transport is a feather weight ISO standard
    publisher-subscriber messaging protocol specially designed for the internet of
    things. Internet of Things is creating the massive machine to machine network
    so that all of the devices like sensors, systems and also the actuators can connect
    to and communicate on the internet and with they need a communications protocol
    so that they can understand each other one of those protocols is message queuing
    telemetry transport. Message queuing telemetry transport is a TCP/IP protocol
    based on subscribe and publish messaging protocol designed for light weight machine-to-machine
    communications. MQTT has built the QoS to deliver the message. QoS 0: Once in
    a time “fire and forget,” if the device is online, it sends the message, and it
    gets delivered or if the device is offline it can’t be delivered it will be thrown
    away. QoS 1: Atleast once. QoS 2: Exactly once, 2 phase commit. Both the QoS 1
    and QoS 2 have the effectively guaranteed delivery, while the QoS 2 uses the two
    phase summit guaranteeing exactly once delivery and also it can give the end-to-end
    protocol level but not within the stacks on each side of the connection these
    QoS 1 and QoS 2 are queued for clients when the user is also online but have no
    timed out. To work the message queuing telemetry transport, it has three stages
    they are called as the message queuing broker. It is like a gateway receiver or
    server and allows the clients to send and also to receive the short messages from
    the broker only if they have subscribed to any topic like weather, temperature
    and also the humidity. Here in the below diagram, the client A is the publisher
    and the remaining client B and C are the subscribers whom receives the information
    which is sent by the sensor known as the client A. And also, these two B and C
    clients subscribe to the particular topic and gets published to the broker all
    the three will have the TCP connection with the broker as in Fig. 5. The sensor
    or the publisher which is called as the client A updates the topic and publishes
    the information about the topic to the MQ broker. These clients have subscribed
    to the topic so when the new piece of information gets published to the topic
    they then get the information from the MQ broker. Fig. 5 Message queuing telemetry
    transport Full size image 3.2 Sensor/Publisher The publisher has the information
    about the topic, and also this publisher has the data about the topic which the
    subscribers have been subscribed earlier. It is connected to the broker via TCP
    connections on all the sides whenever the new data comes, it will be sent to the
    broker. And also the publishers and also the subscribers are not connected directly
    through the TCP/IP connection. And this MQTT publishers allow username and password
    for the authentication and these clients can directly log on via password. These
    passwords are sent by the MQTT via the plain text or in encrypted form. If no
    data was sent, then the publisher will be in the off mode. The subscriber receives
    the filtered messages every message is being filtered by the broker which is the
    middle of the publisher and it also knows that who will send the message and also
    who will receive the message. The subscriber is the application based. The broker
    filter the messages based on the subject and the content based and also the type
    based filtering by the broker. A user can also subscribe to the one topics or
    more topics. When subscribed to the one or more than one topics two characters
    can be used. MQTT supports disconnect and last will and testament messages in
    this they are two types: namely hash character—multi-level wildcard and plus character—single-level
    wildcard MQTT. Clients which disconnect intentionally use disconnect message as
    in Fig. 6. MQTT broker will automatically publish last will and the testament
    messages on the behalf of the clients with unintentionally terminated messages.
    It also supports the retained messages which are automatically delivered when
    a client subscribes to the topic. Fig. 6 Block diagram of MQTT subscriber/client
    Full size image The topics which we select in the MQTT are similar to the files
    in a system using the forward slash(/). In message queuing telemetry transport,
    there is no formal structure to select the topic and a publisher is free to choose,
    it’s own topic names and also the structure but it should consists atleast on
    character to be valid. There is no topics created by the broker. All topics are
    created by a subscriber and also the publisher client, are not permanent. A topic
    only exists only if a subscriber has already subscribed to it before only or a
    broker has restore the last messages stored for that topic. This is the example
    for that E.g.: School/Room/Sensor. 4 Hardware Description Raspberry pi 3 begins
    as a toy computer and ends up being a real desktop PC having an upgraded ARMv7
    multicore processor and gigabytes RAM. In general, Raspberry pi has mode B and
    B+, mode A and A+, Pi zero. This Raspberry pi mode B and B+ are the simplest and
    cheapest but B+ has a bit more improved design of embedded applications. Raspberry
    pi zero has input or output, general purpose input or output (GPIO) and Bluetooth
    capability. They mostly operate at a frequency of 800–1000 MHz, in extreme case
    they can be operated upto 1500 MHz. In this model neither USB nor ethernet ports
    are changed. GPIO are the general purpose input and output pins which are used
    to turn off and to turn the devices like LED which will be present in the Raspberry
    pi. These pins allow you to connect and also to talk to the hardware modules that
    supports the protocol. UART is the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter.
    It receives several bytes of the data from the GPIO pins but it transmits only
    bits of the data in the sequential order. In the asynchronous transmission of
    the data, it allows the bits to be sent or transmit without the sender but it
    will send the signal like the clock signal to the receiver side. UART can be used
    between the two devices only like simplex means data transmitted on one side only
    and also the half duplex in which the data can be transmitted in the either direction
    or the Full duplex. MPC3008 is a high performed and low power 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC). In general to know the hotness as well as the coldness of an
    object, temperature sensor is used. In this LM 35 temperature sensor, the output
    is almost equal to the temperature. It doesn’t require any amplified output rather
    provides higher output than thermocouples. It is sometimes used as a power supply,
    battery, etc. To measure the amount of water in the soil moisture sensor is used.
    Indirectly either by using electrical resistance or neutron interactions water
    volume is measured. Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a variable light control
    resistor. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of LDR decreases. It
    can be used in circuits with light and dark activation switching and also in some
    light sensitive devices. 5 Results Figure 7 shows that the sensor parameters and
    also the weather conditions like temperature, moisture, humidity and also amount
    of light which is receiving. It compares the data log with the already existing
    weather reporting conditions. It also finds whether there is any possibility of
    the rainfall then it will intimates to the user through the registered mail. It
    will also predict the parameters like thunder storms, etc., as in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Message queuing telemetry transport conversation/data log Full size image These
    sensor values are being sent to the clients using the cloud and MQTT protocol.
    These parameters can be checked by the client through the registered mail. 6 Conclusion
    In this system, the irrigation system becomes more simple and easy with the quick
    transmission of the weather parameters by using the MQTT protocol and sending
    this data through cloud to the cloud who has been subscribed. The main advantage
    of using these protocol is when the client is not available then the parameters
    will be sent through the mail. When the client is available with the network then
    he can able to see the data parameters and also he can compare the present data
    with the existing data which has been already sent. So that the farmer will be
    able to know the changes in the atmosphere every day. This can also be implemented
    by using the computer-based algorithm and also the data can be processed without
    any further complexity. With the other specifications, sensors are used to make
    the process better. References J. Gutiérrez, J.F. Villa-Medina, A. Nieto-Garibay,

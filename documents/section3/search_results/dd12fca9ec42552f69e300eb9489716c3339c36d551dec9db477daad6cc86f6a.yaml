    \a\nAbstract: As the key principle of precision farming, variation of actual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET)\nwithin the ﬁeld serves as the basis for crop management.\
    \ Although the estimation of evapotranspiration\nhas achieved great progress through\
    \ the combination of diﬀerent remote sensing data and the FAO-56\ncrop coeﬃcient\
    \ (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coeﬃcient (Ks) at diﬀerent\n\
    space–time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices.\
    \ This work aims to explore\nthe potential of multispectral images taken from\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the\ntemporal and spatial variability\
    \ of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of\nﬁeld\
    \ maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation\
    \ method,\nthe performance of several models was compared including models based\
    \ on Ks either derived\nfrom the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated\
    \ by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio),\nand combined with the basal crop\
    \ coeﬃcient (Kcb) based on the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\nindex (NDVI).\
    \ Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded\
    \ well to\nwater stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results\
    \ of the comparison show that\nET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 method, with an\nR2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from\nthe Ks-Tc ratio had\
    \ a relatively lower correlation with an R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain\n\
    the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize ﬁeld and formulate reasonable\
    \ irrigation schedules,\nthe CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer\
    \ was inverted by the renormalized diﬀerence\nvegetation index (RDVI) and the\
    \ transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance index (TCARI).\nThen, the whole\
    \ map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks\n\
    and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the ﬁeld scale. The ﬁnal\
    \ ET results based on\nmultispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reﬂect\
    \ the crop ET status under diﬀerent\nirrigation levels, and greatly help to improve\
    \ irrigation scheduling through more precise management\nof deﬁcit irrigation.\n\

    \ climate is characterized by long periods of drought and strong interannual\n\
    variability in rainfall amounts and distribution, leading to high year-to-year\
    \ variability in agricultural\ndevelopment and production [1]. The North China\
    \ Plain is one of the most important agricultural\nregions because it accounts\
    \ for about one-ﬁfth of national food production. In this area, rainfall cannot\n\
    meet the crop water requirements, and the overexploitation of groundwater aggravates\
    \ water scarcity,\nreduces the groundwater table, and threatens sustainable agriculture\
    \ [2]. Irrigation is then necessary\nto prevent water stress and ensure proﬁtable\
    \ yields. To determine the optimal irrigation scheduling\nand adopt such strategies\
    \ eﬃciently, it is necessary to have reliable methods of providing information\n\
    about the temporal and spatial variability of crop evapotranspiration (ET) within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale [3].\nThe direct ET measured methods consist of the use of a\
    \ lysimeter, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio,\nand soil water balance. However, they\
    \ face important limitations due to expensive techniques and\nlow spatial representativeness\
    \ of measurements, particularly in agricultural ﬁelds characterized by a\nhigh\
    \ level of heterogeneity in terms of crops and water status [4]. The indirect\
    \ form can be made from\nempirical equations that use agronomic, biophysical,\
    \ and meteorological elements as input variables [5].\nAs the most widely used\
    \ method for the determination of ET, the FAO-56 dual crop coeﬃcient (Kc)\napproach,\
    \ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization in Irrigation and Drainage\
    \ Paper No.\n56 [6], has received favorable acceptance and application worldwide\
    \ [5,7]. The dual Kc approach\ndescribes the relationship between the daily evapotranspiration\
    \ of a given crop and the reference\nevapotranspiration (ET0) by separating the\
    \ single crop coeﬃcient into the basal crop coeﬃcient (Kcb),\nsoil water evaporation\
    \ (Ke) coeﬃcient, and water stress coeﬃcient (Ks). Although simple in design and\n\
    construction, the dual Kc method successfully incorporates a number of consistent\
    \ and compensating\nfactors that distinguishes the ET of any unique crop from\
    \ that of the reference ET [7]. However, the\nmethod is mainly used for the ET\
    \ estimation based on stationary measurements and cannot provide a\nﬁne estimation\
    \ due to inconsistent crop growth.\nTo explore the distribution of crop ET within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale, remote sensing technology provides a\ndependable basis [8].\
    \ The crop coeﬃcient generated from remote sensing based on canopy reﬂectance\n\
    responds to the actual crop condition, captures the variability among diﬀerent\
    \ local atmosphere\nconditions and ﬁeld spatial variability [9], and reﬂects the\
    \ heterogeneity of plant development in large\nirrigated ﬁelds [10–14]. Studies\
    \ have established diﬀerent inversion models between vegetation indices\n(VIs)\
    \ and Kcb [15–18]. For decades, satellite remote sensing images have been the\
    \ main data sources to\nintegrate the FAO-56 for the estimation of crop ET. For\
    \ example, Bellvert et al. [19] used a dataset of the\nvegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ derived from Landsat-8 to facilitate the estimation of the Kcb, and potential\n\
    crop water use. However, the low spatial and temporal resolution of satellite\
    \ data limits its further\napplication in estimating ET within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ At the same time, cloud cover remains a signiﬁcant\nchallenge in satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing [20].\nAs one of the most important emerging remote-sensing platforms,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) have been gradually employed in precise agriculture.\
    \ Soon, UAVs will be vital tools for\ngrowers as they can cover large areas, and\
    \ take advantage of new sensing, mapping, and data analytical\ntechnologies [21–23].\
    \ Real time mapping and rapid image analysis also provide the early detection\
    \ of\nplant water status for timely irrigation scheduling [24]. Based on these\
    \ advantages, UAVs have broad\napplication prospects for more sophisticated ET\
    \ management within the ﬁeld scale. When dealing\nwith the estimation of ET based\
    \ on a combination of UAV and the dual Kc method under water stress\nconditions,\
    \ four parameters are required: ET0, Kcb, Ke, and Ks. ET0 can be estimated using\
    \ the FAO\nPenman–Monteith formula and the collected meteorological data [25].\
    \ Ke is clearly correlated with\nfoliage cover and irrigation/rainfall event,\
    \ and becomes negligible when the crop completely covers the\nsoil [26]. Many\
    \ studies have validated that Kcb has a strong correlation with NDVI and foliage\
    \ cover,\nand applied to practical water requirement monitoring [16,27]. For instance,\
    \ Han et al. [28] studied the\nfeasibility of UAV multispectral remote sensing\
    \ in the estimation of maize crop coeﬃcients at diﬀerent\ngrowth stages. The results\
    \ showed a strong relationship between UAV-measured NDVI and Kcb, with\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n3 of 22\nan R2 value of 0.82. Although the assimilation\
    \ of FAO-56 and remote sensing data has made such great\nprogress, discrepancies\
    \ between the measured and simulated ET remained when water stress occurred.\n\
    The accurate estimation of Ks is the key to accurately estimate crop ET using\
    \ UAV remote sensing\ndata under water stress conditions. Speciﬁcally, Ks represents\
    \ the fraction of potential transpiration\nrate, with a value from 1 to 0, according\
    \ to the level of water stress, which is directly related to the\nwater content\
    \ in the root zone. Less attention has been paid on determining the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient\nKs from the remote sensing data because there are diﬃculties in estimating\
    \ soil and root zone moisture\n(or root zone depletion) from remote sensing data\
    \ [29]. It is necessary to use a new indictor, which\nis easy to obtain and can\
    \ respond to real-time plant-water status. Studies [30,31] have proven that\n\
    canopy temperature (Tc) is closely related to soil water content, actual transpiration,\
    \ and crop water\nstress status. Therefore, Ks and canopy temperature are deﬁnitely\
    \ related to each other. Olivera et\nal. [32] used the vegetation and soil temperatures\
    \ retrieved from LST (land surface temperature) data\nderived from the eddy covariance\
    \ system to estimate the Ks. This method is based on the polygon\ndeﬁned in the\
    \ LST–VI space, which needs a large amount of temperature data and has a complex\n\
    analysis procedure. Recently, studies have evaluated indices based on Tc that\
    \ require less information\nfor detecting crop water stress and have shown that\
    \ Ks is related to several crop water stress indices.\nFor instance, Bausch et\
    \ al. [18] successfully used a ratio of canopy temperature as a substitute for\
    \ the\nsoil moisture based Ks. The ET diﬀerence between the two deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments for the 25-day\ninvestigative period calculated by Tc ratio and water\
    \ balance techniques was 21 mm and 4 mm. Kullberg\net al. [33] observed that using\
    \ an appropriate Ks method had the potential to improve irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ to properly manage stress and ensure optimum crop yield under a limited irrigation\
    \ water\nsupply. A noted advantage of non-dimensional crop indices such as CWSI\
    \ (crop water stress index)\nis that they are typically considered to be scalable\
    \ to Ks for ET estimation (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI). This\nis also the basis behind\
    \ the Tc ratio approach, although it has dimensionality restrictions [34]. For\n\
    the estimation of Ks based on water stress indices, most studies have used handled\
    \ or stationary\ninfrared thermometers [33–35]. A ground-based platform is still\
    \ time consuming and labor intensive.\nAdditionally, like the estimation by counting\
    \ root zone depletion, it is impractical to estimate ET by\ncombining the Kcb\
    \ of large image pixels with Ks based on ground-point measurements due to the\n\
    heterogeneities of the crop and soil status.\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ technology, high-resolution thermal imagery acquired by\nUAVs has been used\
    \ to map plant water stress indices such as the CWSI, and water deﬁcit index (WDI).\n\
    However, when Kcb and Ks are obtained from diﬀerent sensors (i.e., multispectral\
    \ and thermal sensors),\nthe problem of data fusion and matching will be obstacles\
    \ to ET estimation with the UAV system.\nFor example, as the image resolution\
    \ obtained by the two sensors is diﬀerent, image matching with\ndiﬀerent resolutions\
    \ requires a complicated process. Most importantly, the biggest eﬀect is not only\
    \ on\nthe pixel mixing due to the downscale, but on the georectiﬁcation and co-registration\
    \ of the images,\ntherefore, the asynchronous time and space of the Ks and Kcb\
    \ may inﬂuence the acquisition of maize\nET. Previous studies have indicated that\
    \ multispectral VIs have signiﬁcantly high correlation with\nwater stress indicators.\
    \ For example, Samuel et al. [36] summarized the common spectral vegetation\n\
    indices (VIs) that have been correlated to plant water stress. Studies [37–39]\
    \ suggested that the\nrenormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) and transformed\
    \ chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI) are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring. Therefore, the synchronized acquisition of Kcb\nand Ks using one\
    \ sensor (i.e., a multispectral camera) should be explored.\nThis study aimed\
    \ to estimate more accurate ET maps with UAV-based multispectral images over\n\
    maize in the semiarid region of the North China Plain by applying the FAO-56 dual\
    \ Kc approach.\nMore speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst compared the ET derived from water stress\
    \ indices (CWSI and Tc ratio) and\nNDVI to that calculated with the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method by evaluating the suitable water\nstress indicator for local\
    \ maize ET estimation. Next, we investigated the potential of assimilating ET\n\
    estimation with VIs data (multispectral UAV) through the retrieve relation between\
    \ the water stress\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n4 of 22\nindex and VIs to eliminate\
    \ discrepancies caused by using data at diﬀerent scales and obtain a high\nresolution\
    \ (4.7 cm) spatial-temporal ET map.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\

    \ Factors and Soil Water Content\nThe weather data were obtained from an automated\
    \ weather station located on a grass reference\nsurface (0.95 ha) that was 1000\
    \ meters away from the research ﬁeld, with observations of rainfall, air\ntemperature\
    \ (Ta), humidity, net solar radiation (Rn), and wind speed (2 m above the reference\
    \ surface).\nExcept for rainfall, the data acquisition interval was 30 minutes.\n\
    Soil water content (SWC) was measured two or three times each week on the day\
    \ before or after\nirrigation within each sampling plot by the traditional gravimetric\
    \ method [43]. At each sampling\nplot, three sampling sites were randomly chosen\
    \ around the center. The samples were collected by soil\naugers at depths of 30\
    \ cm, 60 cm, 90 cm, and 120 cm. Soil samples were put in aluminum boxes to\navoid\
    \ the inﬂuence of evaporation. Basically, the gravimetric method involves taking\
    \ soil samples,\nweighing, oven-drying, and reweighing them, then expressing the\
    \ moisture content (i.e., loss in weight)\nas a percentage of the oven-dry weight.\
    \ This is the weight or mass basis of expressing soil moisture\ncontent. Then,\
    \ by multiplying the bulk density, the results can be expressed in terms of volume\
    \ [44].\nThe average SWC (θ) was estimated by interpolating the soil moisture\
    \ observations of the diﬀerent\ndepths belonging to the root-zone of maize.\n\
    2.2.2. Measurement of Maize Parameters\nMaize canopy temperature (Tc) and UAV\
    \ multispectral data were synchronously collected under\nclear sky at solar noon.\
    \ Tc was collected during the full foliage cover period (6–29 August 2017\nincluding\
    \ the reproductive and maturation stages). A handheld infrared thermometer (Raytek\
    \ ST60+,\nRaytek Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used to measure Tc with a measurement\
    \ error of ±1 ◦C or\n±1% of the reading. The larger values were adopted in the\
    \ practical application. The temperature and\nspectral ranges of the Raytek ST60+\
    \ are −32–600 ◦C and 8–14 µm, respectively. The emissivity value\nwas set to 0.97\
    \ [45]. To avoid the interference of soil, the thermometer was used to sweep the\
    \ canopy\n(about 120◦) perpendicular to the row, 30 cm above the canopy, and at\
    \ a 15◦ horizontal angle. At each\nsample site, three measurements were made to\
    \ obtain the Tc. The values averaged over one sampling\nsite or over one plot\
    \ (yellow circle in Figure 1c) were taken to represent their status.\nThe main\
    \ plant parameters needed to run the modiﬁed FAO-56 model (see Section 2.2.3)\
    \ are\ncanopy height (h) and leaf area index (LAI). A random sampling method was\
    \ used to collect the LAI\nand plant height of maize. An LAI-2200C canopy analyzer\
    \ (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA)\nwas used to measure the LAI of maize;\
    \ 10 sampling points were randomly selected for each plot and\nthe average value\
    \ was obtained. For each plot plant height of maize, 15 representative maize plants\n\
    were randomly selected and measured by tape measure. Cubic spline interpolation\
    \ is a piecewise\nregression approach that uses third-order polynomials for interpolation\
    \ between a series of paired\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n7 of 22\ndata points\
    \ [14]. Thus, cubic spline was used to process the measured LAI and plant height\
    \ data, and\nthen the daily sequence of maize LAI and plant height data were obtained.\n\
    2.2.3. The Modiﬁed FAO-56 Dual Crop Coeﬃcient Method\nIn FAO-56, the actual ET\
    \ is deﬁned as the product of crop coeﬃcient (Kc) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) [26]. In the dual Kc model, Kc is split into two factors that separately\n\
    describe the evaporation (Ke) and transpiration (Kcb) components. The method has\
    \ been widely used\nin scheduling irrigation and improving agricultural production\
    \ [46]. FAO-56 ET is estimated as follows:\nET = ET0 ∗ (KcbKs + Ke),\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ ET is in mm/d; Ke is the evaporation coeﬃcient of the bare soil fraction; Kcb\
    \ is the basal crop\ncoeﬃcient; Ks is the water stress coeﬃcient; and ET0 is the\
    \ grass reference evapotranspiration in\nmm/d. The stages of canopy temperature\
    \ acquisition and ET estimation were in the period of high\ncoverage (i.e., vegetation\
    \ cover ranging from 0.79 to 0.84 as estimated by an empirical equation based\n\
    on NDVI [47]). With Ke = 0.25 × (1 − fc) [26], it had a minor inﬂuence on total\
    \ ET and was ignored.\nThe ET0 of this reference surface was estimated according\
    \ to the following Penman–Monteith\nequation:\nET0 =\n0.408∆(Rn − G) + γ\n900\n\
    T+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 + 0.34u2)\n,\n(2)\nwhere Rn is the net radiation at\
    \ the crop surface; G is the soil heat ﬂux density (as the magnitude of the\n\
    1-day or 10-day soil heat ﬂux beneath the grass reference surface is relatively\
    \ small, it may be ignored,\nthus Gday = 0 [26]); T is the mean daily air temperature\
    \ at 2 m height; u2 is the wind speed at 2 m\nheight; es is the saturation vapor\
    \ pressure; ea is the actual vapor pressure; ∆ is the slope vapor pressure\ncurve;\
    \ and γ is a psychrometric constant.\nThe basal crop coeﬃcient, Kcb, is generally\
    \ obtained from the guidelines of FAO-56 by looking-up\nthe tabulated value at\
    \ every growth stage and then linearly interpolating it to obtain the daily values.\n\
    The approach from the original FAO-56 dual Kc procedures cannot calculate the\
    \ daily actual value\nof Kcb [42]. Feng et al. [48] modiﬁed Kcb with LAI through\
    \ eddy covariance systems near the\nexperimentation site, which illustrated that\
    \ the modiﬁed dual crop coeﬃcient method could estimate\nmaize ET accurately on\
    \ the North China Plain. Therefore, in order to evaluate the dynamic changes of\n\
    ET in the maize ﬁeld more accurately, the canopy height and LAI were used to modify\
    \ the dynamic\nKcb. The modiﬁed FAO-56 Kcb value can be calculated by Equations\
    \ (3) and (4):\nKcb − Tab = Kc,min +\n\x10\nKcb,full − Kc,min\n\x11\n(1 − exp[−kLAI])\
    \ ,\n(3)\nKcb, full = min(1 + 0.1h, Kc,max) + [0.04(u2 − 2) − 0.004(RHmin − 45)]\n\
    \ \nh\n3\n!0.3\n,\n(4)\nwhere Kc,min is the minimum for bare soil (0.15); Kcb,full\
    \ is the estimated basal Kcb for vegetation having\nfull ground cover; Kc,max\
    \ is the maximum Kc (1.2); RHmin is the minimum relative humidity (%); and k\n\
    is the canopy attenuation coeﬃcient of radiation, and the value of k is listed\
    \ in Table 2.\nThe crop water stress coeﬃcient Ks related to the actual root zone\
    \ water content is a key parameter\nfor calculating and simulating soil water\
    \ conditions. Several linear and curvilinear functions have been\nproposed to\
    \ adjust for the eﬀects of decreasing available water on ET or for the Ks used\
    \ in Equation (1).\nThe simple linear model for estimating Ks as described in\
    \ FAO-33 is commonly used and calculated by\nEquation (5) ,which is an equivalent\
    \ expression to the FAO-56 Ks procedure [49].\nKs − FAO =\n\n1,\nθ ≥ θj\n\

    \ and a maximum value (that reached 1 m at the beginning of the\nmid-season stage).\

    FAO-56 [6]. When the θ was lower than θj, the crop begins to reach the stress\

    \ \nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of the UAV multispectral remote sensing system\

    \ 11 UAV ﬂights were conducted on sunny\ndays between 11:00 and 13:00 local time\
    \ (Chinese standard time, 11:44–13:44) with the RedEdge camera\nlens vertically\

    \ A total of 2185 images (ﬁve\nbands) were collected during a single ﬂight and\

    \ models between UAV-based multispectral VIs and crop coeﬃcients\n(NDVI vs. Kcb\
    \ and TRCAI/RDVI vs. Ks), three VIs were selected: NDVI [50], transformed chlorophyll\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n9 of 22\nabsorption in reﬂectance index (TCARI) [51],\
    \ and the renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index\n(RDVI) [52]. In addition, cubic\
    \ spline interpolation was used to determine the VI values between two\nﬂight\
    \ overpasses. Their calculation equations are as follows:\nNDVI = ρnir − ρred\n\
    ρnir + ρred\n,\n(7)\nTCARI = 3\nh\x10\nρrededge − ρred\n\x11\n− 0.2\n\x10\nρrededge\

    \ + ρred\n,\n(9)\nwhere ρnir, ρred, ρrededge, and ρgreen are the reﬂectance values\
    \ of ground objects in the near-infrared, red,\nred-edge, and green bands, respectively.\n\
    2.2.5. Crop Coeﬃcient Estimation Using Reﬂectance Data\nReﬂectance-based basal\
    \ crop coeﬃcient (Kcb) methods have been used to improve the irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ of maize. NDVI is one of the most widely used indices for estimating crop parameters.\n\
    This index is highly sensitive to variations of LAI and the fraction of the ground\
    \ that is covered by\nvegetation, (fc). The NDVI has a linear relationship with\
    \ fc along the whole range of vegetation cover [47].\nAccordingly in this study,\
    \ Equation (10) was used for fc estimation. In this study, one 12 m × 12 m area\n\
    was selected as the spectral sampling plot in each treatment (yellow box in Figure\
    \ 1b). Studies [53,54]\nshowed that Kcb can be estimated from fc.\nfc =\nNDVI\
    \ − NDVImin\nNDVImax − NDVImin\n,\n(10)\nwhere NDVImin and NDVImax are the minimum\
    \ and the maximum values of the NDVI associated\nwith bare soil and dense vegetation,\
    \ respectively. Once fc has been obtained through Equation (10), the\nKcb can\
    \ be estimated as:\nKcb − NDVI = 1.13 fc + 0.14,\n(11)\nThe two diﬀerent Ks obtained\
    \ from CWSI and Tc ratio were derived from the handheld infrared\nthermometer,\
    \ with daily values taken around local times between 11:00 and 13:00 (local time),\
    \ which\nare approximate times of peak stress.\nJackson et al. [30] showed that\
    \ CWSI is inversely related to the water use of the crop under\nconsideration;\
    \ Ks can also be calculated from CWSI by:\nKs−CWSI = 1 − CWSI,\n(12)\nOne of the\
    \ widely used methods for estimating CWSI is based on measured canopy\ntemperature\
    \ [30,55]. The CWSI is deﬁned in Equation (13).\nCWSI = dTm − dTLL\ndTUL − dTLL\n\
    ,\n(13)\nwhere dTm, dTLL, and dTUL are the actual measurement, lower limit, and\
    \ upper limit of the\ncanopy–air temperature diﬀerence (Tc−Ta), respectively.\n\
    More detailed information about local\nCWSI measurements can be found in Zhang\
    \ et al. [39]. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while\nCWSI = 1 indicates the\
    \ most severe stress.\nZhang et al. [39] established linear regression models\
    \ (R2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between TRCAI/RDVI\nand CWSI (Equation (14)). The local\
    \ calibration of CWSI performed in [39] was also retained here.\nThus, we could\
    \ integrate the remote sensing data into the Ks model by establishing a stable\
    \ relationship\nbetween VIs and CWSI. According to the relationship between Ks\
    \ and CWSI (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI)\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n10 of 22\nand to\
    \ rescale the Ks value between 0 and 1, the linear regression models can been\
    \ shown as per\nEquation (15):\nCWSI =\n\n0\n(TCARI/RDVI ≤ 0.195)\n2.41\

    \ − 0.47)\n(0.195 < TCARI/RDVI < 0.609)\n0\n(0.609 ≤ TCARI/RDVI)\n,\n(15)\nAn\
    \ alternative method to evaluate water stress that only requires the crop canopy\
    \ temperature\nwas proposed by Bausch et al. [35]. The relationship between Ks\
    \ and Tc ratio is as follows:\nKs−Tc ratio = Tc ratio = TcNS\nTc\n,\n(16)\nwhere\
    \ Tc ratio is a stress coeﬃcient proposed as a surrogate for the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient Ks from\nFAO-56. Tc is the canopy temperature and TcNS is the temperature\
    \ of a fully irrigated, non-stressed\ncanopy, which was chosen as the lowest canopy\
    \ temperature observed at the given timestamp including\nall treatments [34].\
    \ This temperature ratio was found to be capable of quantitatively monitoring\n\
    water stress and can potentially be used in the place of the water stress coeﬃcient\
    \ when soil water\nmeasurements are not available.\n2.2.6. Evapotranspiration\
    \ Comparison and Statistical Analysis\nDue to the lack of validation information\
    \ from an eddy covariance tower or lysimeter, the ET\nestimated by the modiﬁed\
    \ dual Kc method [42,48] was used to validate the model. Ding et al. [42]\nfound\
    \ good agreement between the predicted ET and transpiration using the modiﬁed\
    \ model and\nthe measurements through the lysimeter for maize in 2010, with a\
    \ slope of linear regression of 0.99\n(R2 = 0.90) and 1.01 (R2 = 0.92). Feng et\
    \ al. [48] also obtained similar results and suggested that the\nmodiﬁed dual\
    \ crop coeﬃcient method was suitable for calculating the actual daily ET of the\
    \ main\ncrops across the North China Plain. Studies [56,57] also used the local\
    \ ET estimated by the FAO-56\nKc method to validate the derived ET from their\
    \ model. Thus, employing the ET data estimated by\nthe modiﬁed FAO-56 dual Kc\
    \ method as the validation set had certain accuracy in this study. The\nsimulated\
    \ daily ET of the maize derived from the two Ks methods and NDVI-based Kcb methods\n\
    (ET-CWSI and ET-ratio) were compared with the values obtained from the modiﬁed\
    \ FAO-56 dual\ncrop coeﬃcient method. The ET-CWSI, ET-ratio, and ET-FAO values\
    \ were compared by using a linear\nregression analysis and the statistical parameters\
    \ of the coeﬃcient of determination (R2), root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), and\
    \ index of agreement (d) were used as a relative measure of the diﬀerence\namong\
    \ variables. Perfect agreement would exist between the observed and modeled values\
    \ if d = 1.\nFinally, we compared the cumulative evapotranspiration (CET) obtained\
    \ by the VI method with\nthe water balance approach to evaluate the ability of\
    \ ET determination by UAV. Cumulative ET\nobtained by the soil–water balance [58]\
    \ was used as the reference ET, and a relatively simple relation is\nexpressed\
    \ as:\n(Pr + I) + U − RO − ET − DP − ∆SW = 0,\n(17)\nwhere Pr is the eﬀective\
    \ precipitation; I is the irrigation depth; U is the ground water replenishment;\n\
    RO is the runoﬀ from the soil surface; and DP is the deep percolation of water\
    \ moving out of the root\nzone. ∆SW is the change between the ﬁrst and last measurements\
    \ of soil water storage within the root\nzone. All terms are expressed in mm.\

    We retrieved the maize evapotranspiration map by combining the Ks map based on\
    \ UAV\nTCARI/RDVI (Equation (15)) with the Kcb map based on the NDVI, according\
    \ to the FAO-56 dual crop\ncoeﬃcient method. Figure 9 and Table 4 show the results\
    \ of ET on DOY 217, 221, 231, and 241 during\nthe reproductive and maturation\
    \ stages. ET was seen to decrease with decreasing irrigation among\nthe three\
    \ diﬀerent irrigation levels. On DOY 217, the highest value of ET in the study\
    \ ﬁeld reached\napproximately 8 mm because of the previous day’s rainfall. In\
    \ addition, diﬀerent treatments presented\nsimilar mean ET on DOY 217. On DOY\
    \ 231 and 241, there were relatively less ET because of higher\ntemperature and\
    \ less irrigation or rainfall, with maximum values of approximately 5 mm, and\
    \ 4 mm,\nrespectively. On DOY 221, 231 and 241, the minimum ET can be found in\
    \ TRT 2. In these three days,\nthe mean ET of TRT 2 was 5.72 mm, 4.23 mm and 1.33\
    \ mm, respectively. Especially on DOY 241, most\nof the maize was in a state of\
    \ almost no transpiration due to a long-term lack of irrigation/rainfall.\nRemote\

    18\nThe diﬀerent soil texture and soil heterogeneity led to diﬀerent water, fertilizer,\
    \ gas, and heat\nconditions and diﬀerent crop growth status. We could even observe\
    \ the diﬀerences of ET in the\nsame treatment through the high spatial resolution\
    \ (4.7 cm) multispectral images. Table 4 shows the\ntreatment values of CV (coeﬃcient\
    \ of variation) and mean ET. The diﬀerent water treatments in spatial\nvariations\
    \ of ﬁeld ET capacity from the reproductive to maturation stage were distinct.\
    \ On the whole,\nCV increased with decreased ET and increased water stress. In\
    \ addition, CV increased over the maize\ngrowth period in TRTs 2 and 3, which\
    \ illustrated that the prolonged water stress distinctly detected\nspatial ﬂuctuations\
    \ in ﬁeld soil heterogeneity via its inﬂuences on maize evapotranspiration condition.\n\
    For instance, in the deﬁcit irrigation treatment TRTs 2 and 3, CVs increased from\
    \ 9% to 34% and 8% to\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n16 of 22\n18% with the accumulation\
    \ of water stress. On the other hand, a higher CV in TRT 2 demonstrated that\n\
    the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water stress could severely aﬀect maize\
    \ ET.\nNext, the cumulative daily values of ET from 6 to 29 August 2017 for the\
    \ three irrigation treatments\nwere calculated by two techniques. (1) The VIs\
    \ (the average value of the entire treatment zone) method,\nwhere daily crop water\
    \ requirement (ET) was calculated by multiplying the daily crop coeﬃcients of\n\
    daily ET0 (Equation (1)). As above-mentioned, crop coeﬃcients were derived through\
    \ the relationships\nbetween Kcb and NDVI, and between Ks and TRCAI/RDVI. In addition,\
    \ a cubic interpolation was\nused to determine the values of VIs (NDVI, TRCAI,\
    \ and RDVI) between two UAV ﬂights. (2) The water\nbalance approach (Equation\
    \ (18)). As presented in Table 5, the total water consumption of the three\ntreatments\
    \ for the study period were 75 mm, 53 mm, and 67 mm, respectively. The diﬀerence\
    \ between\nthe cumulative ET calculated by the VIs method and water balance approach\
    \ were 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm,\nand 5 mm, respectively. Note that the retrieved ET were\
    \ similar to the crop water consumption.\nTable 5. Cumulative ET from the 6–29\

    Daily ET represents the most important process for the determination of the surface\
    \ and\nmass-energy interaction for both water resource management and agricultural\
    \ practices. At present,\nthere are mainly two types of models for ET assessment.\
    \ The ﬁrst involves models using thermal band\nbased energy-balance approaches\
    \ (SEB) [59,60]. The second method utilizes the empirical VI model.\nThough the\
    \ surface energy balance models are able to estimate ET with ﬁne accuracy. Deﬁciencies\n\
    in the current suite of thermal data sources (e.g., plenty of data requirements,\
    \ biases, inaccurate\ncalibration, poor spatial or temporal resolution) can strongly\
    \ limit the applicability of such procedures\nfor the continuous monitoring of\
    \ ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution [61]. Due to the longstanding\nfamiliarity\
    \ and widespread use within the irrigation community of crop coeﬃcient approaches\
    \ and\ntheir relative operational simplicity, reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcients\
    \ might elicit a successful and\nfar-reaching approach for improving irrigation\
    \ management [12]. Multispectral VIs calculated from\ncanopy reﬂectance can be\
    \ used to simulate real-time Kcb. Figure 6 shows that there was a strong\nsimilarity\
    \ between the Kcb-NDVI and Kcb-Table. With the help of UAVs, we can provide more\n\
    sophisticated Kcb information for irrigation management. Studies [29,62] showed\
    \ that the VI-Kcb\nmodel can perform well under well irrigation conditions, but\
    \ that it could be diﬃcult to capture actual\nET under the water stress condition.\
    \ Water stress evaluation (Ks) based on soil water storage in the root\nzone is\
    \ the traditional and common method, but is costly and there is a shortage of\
    \ representation. For\ninstance, Er-Raki et al. [29] reported that the original\
    \ FAO-56 model may overestimate eddy covariance\nmeasurements because of the misrepresentation\
    \ of the soil stress factor.\nTo deal with these defects, Ks estimation is mainly\
    \ divided into direct and indirect methods. In\nindirect methods, they usually\
    \ need to ﬁrst obtain the potential ET (PET) and actual ET, and then\ncalculate\
    \ Ks through the soil–water balance. It is diﬃcult to obtain the actual ET because\
    \ sophisticated\nand costly instruments such as eddy covariance and lysimeters\
    \ are generally limited. On the other\nhand, estimating Ks through the indirect\
    \ method is not only laborious, but is also not time-eﬀective.\nDiarra et al.\
    \ [63] highlighted the uncertainty of indirect assessment in detecting crop water\
    \ stress in\nlight of the decision making process for irrigation planning. Therefore,\
    \ the direct calculation of Ks\nis very important for the application of the FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method. Some studies have employed\nwater stress indices derived from\
    \ temperature data as the proxy. For instance, Kullberg et al. [33] used\nfour\
    \ canopy temperature–based methods (CWSI, degrees above non-stressed (DANS), degrees\
    \ above\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n17 of 22\ncanopy threshold (DACT), and Tc\
    \ ratio derived from infrared thermal radiometer) to calculate Ks and\nestimate\
    \ ET in a deﬁcit irrigation experiment of corn. A similar observation was made\
    \ by this study\nwhen estimating Ks for maize with the CWSI. Figure 9 shows that\
    \ the Ks derived CWSI was useful to\nestimate ET, with an acceptable accuracy\
    \ of R2 = 0.81 and RMSE about 0.95 mm/day when compared\nwith the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ Kc method. Bausch et al. [35] also obtained similar results using Tc ratio.\
    \ The\napplicability of the water stress index may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent areas\
    \ and cultivation conditions,\nso it is necessary to choose the local appropriate\
    \ water stress index. Furthermore, the water stress\nindices based on canopy temperature\
    \ may be a more realistic parameter than soil–water content to\nrepresent the\
    \ stress coeﬃcient due to the complicated physiological processes that plants\
    \ undergo as\nthey encounter water stress [35]. In Figure 7, we can see that the\
    \ Ks values calculated by CWSI are\nnot 1, as are the FAO-56 Ks in full-irrigation\
    \ TRT 1. It is probable that even a well-watered crop could\nhave a high canopy\
    \ temperature because of other changes in microclimate such as air temperature\n\
    and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) [64]. The change in the air temperature surrounding\
    \ the leaf will\nchange the leaf temperature and directly aﬀect the gradient of\
    \ water vapor between the leaf and the\natmosphere. Water deﬁcit stress and heat\
    \ stress may be induced by changes in available water, VPD,\nand increased ambient\
    \ air temperature [65].\nStationary infrared thermometers were mainly used for\
    \ validating the relationship between water\nstress indictors and Ks [33,35],\
    \ which can be greatly constrained by transport and operator costs and it\ncan\
    \ be diﬃcult to obtain large area images of crop. These shortcomings may cause\
    \ signiﬁcant errors\ndue to the diﬃculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous,\
    \ targeted soil, or plant water status. More\nimportantly, it is diﬃcult to obtain\
    \ Kcb and Ks on a large area at the same time. Kcb and Ks from\ndiﬀerent platforms\
    \ and scales will inevitably lead to errors in estimating ET, especially with\
    \ the high\nheterogeneities of soil and crops. Several studies [36,66,67] have\
    \ revealed the feasibility of mapping\ncrop water conditions using spectral vegetation\
    \ indices, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution\ncapabilities that\
    \ are more diﬃcult in the thermal region. The RDVI and TCARI were developed\n\
    to reduce the variability of the photosynthetically active radiation due to the\
    \ presence of diverse\nnon-photosynthetic materials and are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring to capture the changes in canopy\nstructures caused by water stress\
    \ [36,68]. Compared to the Ks calculated by on-site measurements, the\nKs based\
    \ on VI-Ks regression models could better reﬂect the water stress conditions of\
    \ maize at the\nﬁeld scale. Taking DOY 231 as an example, the mean ET could well\
    \ reﬂect TRT 2 (69%) and TRT 1\n(100%) in the reproductive stage, with the corresponding\
    \ values of 5.05 mm and 4.23 mm, respectively.\nTable 5 conﬁrmed the utility of\
    \ VIs to help constrain the ET components under three diﬀerent water\ntreatments.\
    \ Cumulative estimated ET diﬀered from the observed by only 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm, and\
    \ 5 mm\nfor TRTs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The result during the 24-day investigative\
    \ period conﬁrmed that\nthe model may be suitable for clearly distinguishing the\
    \ diﬀerent irrigation schemes. In addition, we\ncould obtain accurate ET only\
    \ through the meteorological and UAV multispectral images.\nPrevious studies have\
    \ reported on combining the FAO-56 Kc model with Landsat [13,57,69],\nSPOT [25,70],\
    \ and Sentinel 2 [71] data to estimate the crop coeﬃcient and map crop water consumption.\n\
    However, with satellite remote sensing, a pixel represents a large area. It is\
    \ diﬃcult to observe the\nvariability in crop status on the ﬁeld scale and to\
    \ formulate precise irrigation plans. In addition, newly\nhigher resolution observation\
    \ platforms may be too costly for crop monitoring. In contrast, UAVs\ncan monitor\
    \ ﬁeld ET information scale up information from the leaf to canopy/ﬁeld levels\
    \ and maybe\nsuitable technology for actual problem scouting within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ From the ET maps (Figure 9), we\ncan observe that the evapotranspiration of\
    \ crops varied even with the same treatment. Table 4 shows\nthe mean and CV values\
    \ of diﬀerent treatments due to the diﬀerent soil texture and soil heterogeneity\n\
    in the ﬁeld. Explicitly, because of the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water\
    \ stress, the CV of\nET reached 34% on DOY 241. Acquiring such data for planning\
    \ is probably the role most people\nenvisage when they think of UAV remote sensing\
    \ for precision agriculture. For example, Shi et al. [72]\nproposed a decision\
    \ support system for variable rate irrigation through ﬁeld ET maps acquired by\n\
    multispectral UAV images, which were inputs to the fuzzy inference system and\
    \ were successful in\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n18 of 22\nproviding a duty-cycle\
    \ control map for a central pivot variable rate irrigation system. Compared with\n\
    satellite remote sensing data, using UAV for ﬁeld information management has unique\
    \ advantages,\nbut there are still challenges in its application. UAV remote sensing\
    \ images usually need to be acquired\non-site by researchers, which may lead to\
    \ problems if the research area is remote and diﬃcult to reach,\nand the UAV cannot\
    \ take long-distance photographs due to battery power limitations, so there are\n\
    certain limitations in wider-range crop monitoring. Moreover, using UAVs for planning\
    \ has high costs\nfor data acquisition and analysis. To make monitoring economically\
    \ worthwhile for farmers, new\nmethods of analysis are needed to bring costs down.\
    \ Even so, UAV technology is now available to give\nfarmers the data products\
    \ they have long been requesting from remote sensing [73]. In sum, this study\n\
    demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop ET under the water stress condition\
    \ and monitor\nits spatial variability at a ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based VI-Kcb\
    \ and VI-Ks regression models.\n5. Conclusions\nAs the most widely used approach\
    \ for calculating crop evapotranspiration (ET), the FAO-56 dual\nKc method has\
    \ been increasingly used and improved with remote sensing data. However, the accurate\n\
    estimation of the temporal and spatial variability of crop ET within the ﬁeld\
    \ scale is still a challenge,\nespecially when water stress occurs. To better\
    \ monitor water requirements under water stress and\nprovide a simpler and more\
    \ maneuverable method for farming practices, this study investigated\nwhether\
    \ an UAV-based multispectral remote sensing system could map the evapotranspiration\
    \ of\nmaize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation at the ﬁeld scale as a\
    \ supplement to the dual crop\ncoeﬃcient model. We conﬁrmed that CWSI can be a\
    \ better index assimilated into local maize ET\nestimation under deﬁcit irrigation.\
    \ The comparison results show that the ET derived from Ks-CWSI\nhad a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 Kc method, with a coeﬃcient of determination\nvalue\
    \ of 0.81, root mean square error value of 0.96 mm/d, and index of agreement value\
    \ of 0.94. Based\non which, a stable relationship between VIs and crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kcb and Ks) can be assimilated\ninto the FAO-56 dual Kc method for ﬁeld maize\
    \ ET estimation. Thanks to the UAV system, we could\nobtain high-resolution images\
    \ with higher frequencies for ﬁner irrigation management. In summary,\nthis study\
    \ demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop evapotranspiration and monitoring\
    \ its\nspatial variability within the ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based multispectral\
    \ images under the water\nstress condition. Future experiments will incorporate\
    \ the ground validation (eddy covariance or\nlysimeter) of ET to provide an independent\
    \ assessment of model accuracy and use more convenient\nand reliable water stress\
    \ indices to evaluate crop stress and quantify crop evapotranspiration over a\n\
    longer crop growth period.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.T. and\

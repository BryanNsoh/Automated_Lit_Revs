    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of

    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.

    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave
    and Insteon. Empty Cell ZigBee Z-Wave Insteon Media wireless (radio) wireless

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of
    population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it
    becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population.
    Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative
    tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism
    that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the
    machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with
    IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next
    agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of
    ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction
    of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction,
    disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision
    are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order
    to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated
    for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing
    eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by
    collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and
    intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour
    to a great extent. This article demonstrates how knowledge-based agriculture can
    improve the sustainable productivity and quality of the product. A graphical abstract

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution

    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.

    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Humanity is confronted with the grand challenge of how to increase agricultural

    production to achieve food security during the 21st century and feed a population
    that

    is expected to grow to 10 billion people. This needs to be done while maintaining

    sustainable agricultural systems and simultaneously facing challenges such as
    a

    changing climate, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased
    erosion

    and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather events. Precision

    Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s because of the development
    of

    several key technologies like GPS and satellite imagery. This paper argues that
    with

    the increasing impact of climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture

    and agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision Agriculture
    and

    Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could leverage past technologies

    combined with Big Data analysis. This new, technology-focused SPAE transitions
    from

    a site-speciﬁc management focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish

    this transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing principle
    that

    connects local, site-speciﬁc data generators called smart farms to a regional
    and global

    view of agriculture that can support both the agricultural industry and policymakers

    in government. This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks

    into a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect

    ﬁeld, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability. Automation and the use
    of

    artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), drones, robots, and Big
    Data serve

    as a basis for a global “Digital Twin,” which will contribute to the development
    of

    site-speciﬁc conservation and management practices that will increase incomes
    and

    global sustainability of agricultural systems.

    INTRODUCTION

    The 21st century presents formidable challenges to sustainability that humanity
    will have to

    confront. The need to increase agricultural production to ensure food security
    for a global

    population estimated to grow to 9–10 billion people in the coming decades while
    confronting a

    changing climate that threatens sustainability will put pressure on agricultural
    systems. The

    United Nations Secretary-General recently warned the global community that climatic
    changes

    Delgado et al.

    Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture

    are occurring at a faster rate than humanity is addressing

    them and that humanity will be impacted by sea level rise

    and more extreme weather (United Nations, 2018). Recent

    reports released by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

    Change support these statements (United Nations, 2018). The

    increased occurrence of extreme weather events will increase

    the potential for erosion in agricultural systems (Pruski and

    Nearing, 2002; SWCS, 2003). Pruski and Nearing (2002) reported

    that erosion rates could increase by 1.7% for every 1% increase

    in total rainfall due to climate change. Without conservation

    practices humanity will not be able to adapt to a changing

    climate, as conservation practices will be key tools to maintain

    and increase the productivity and sustainability of agricultural

    systems (Delgado et al., 2011; Walthall et al., 2012; Spiegal et al.,

    2018). Big data analysis will also be one of the key tools that will

    contribute to development of sustainable systems.

    It is thought that crop production must be increased by

    60–100% by the year 2050 to meet the nutritional needs of

    a future human population of 9–10 billion. Crop production

    systems that yield more food of higher nutritional content are

    needed, yet at the same time, they must have a diminished

    impact on the environment. Agricultural intensiﬁcation during

    the 20th century was through the substantial use of fertilizer,

    pesticides, and irrigation, all at a signiﬁcant environmental cost.

    These technologies were part of the Green Revolution that

    helped achieve food security for billions of people. However, the

    challenges of the 21st century are diﬀerent, and soil and water

    conservation will be key to achieve food security, and sustainable

    precision agriculture and environment (SPAE) will be needed

    so that intensive agriculture and a changing climate will not

    generate additional impacts that could contribute to accelerating

    the pace of a changing climate. As a part of sustainable

    agriculture, next-generation cropping systems that couple

    biologically-based technologies (plant-beneﬁcial microbes, cover

    crops) and precision agriculture (PA) and precision conservation

    (PC) need to be developed to decrease fertilizer, pesticide,

    and water inputs while increasing conservation eﬀectiveness to

    maintain sustainable agriculture at a ﬁeld level and sustainability

    across a watershed. Crop cultivars with enhanced nutritional

    content and enhanced tolerance to abiotic (drought, salinity,

    heat, etc.) and/or biotic (disease) stresses need to be developed

    using advanced breeding and biotechnology approaches. These

    enhanced cultivars will no doubt disrupt the status quo of

    agricultural business.

    Central to SPAE and the rapid development of these cropping

    systems is the use of PA and PC in the development and use

    of technology with the capacity to manage and disseminate

    accurate data and information at all levels of the agricultural

    ecosystem. PA (Pierce and Nowak, 1999), PC (Berry et al., 2003,

    2005; Delgado and Berry, 2008; Sassenrath and Delgado, 2018)

    (Figure 1), and sustainable agriculture “are inextricably linked”

    (Berry et al., 2003, 2005; Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer,

    2004). Sustainable agriculture and PC focus on increasing

    conservation eﬀectiveness and stress environmental impact and

    sustainability, while PA is often about immediate cost savings at

    a speciﬁc location by optimizing returns on inputs. This paper

    focuses on sustainability at both a site-speciﬁc management scale

    and a global scale. For that reason, the emphasis is on information

    systems and their ability to support a variety of characteristics of

    PA, PC, and global sustainability.

    Inherent in both the complexity and accuracy of SPAE is the

    need to manage data spatially, which has traditionally been the

    realm of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)1 For example,

    PA and PC use geospatial data and sensors for crop yield and any

    other measurable variable to apply the correct rate of fertilizer,

    water, and pesticide; manage drainage and water runoﬀ; reduce

    movement of agrochemicals; and use the right management

    practices at the ﬁeld and oﬀ-site (Delgado et al., 2018a). Both

    PA and PC allow the farmer to treat the production ﬁeld as

    the heterogeneous surface it is (fertility, water, plant pathogens,

    slope, surface runoﬀ, drainage, etc., which are all highly variable

    throughout the ﬁeld) instead of as a homogeneous surface as it

    was treated in the past. SPAE also manages geospatial data, but

    its spatial relationships can be more abstract from the soil level to

    the molecular level in order to model more complex biological

    systems. In fact, Esri refers to this concept as the “science of

    where,” implying that GIS is evolving beyond the traditional

    geospatial realm of maps, images, etc. to modeling more complex

    relationships (Dolan et al., 2006).

    With increased adoption of PA and PC by farmers will

    come increased development and marketing of tools for PA

    and PC to speed up the adoption of technology. In the

    developed world primarily, advanced sensors and systems that

    deliver decision support tools directly to the farmer will

    be developed, allowing real-time decisions on the delivery

    of appropriate rate of inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticide)

    (Fulton and Darr, 2018) as the farmer drives the tractor

    through the ﬁeld, implements drainage systems (Shedekar and

    Brown, 2018) and/or tries to simultaneously conserve wildlife

    (McConnell and Burger, 2018).

    The need for PA and PC will only heighten, as, for example,

    nutrient losses to the environment impact groundwater and

    surface water resources, such as has occurred with the hypoxic

    zone in the Gulf of Mexico (Goolsby et al., 2001; Rabalais

    et al., 2002a,b) and the hypoxic zone and microcystin levels in

    Lake Erie (Smith et al., 2018). The World Health Organization

    (2011) has reported that microcystin concentrations above 1.0

    µg L−1 in treated drinking water is not safe and is unhealthy

    for human consumption and in the USA, the EPA reports that

    for children less than 6 years of age the safe level is 0.3 µg L−1

    (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2015). Water

    issues will continue to increase in many parts of the world in

    the near term, especially if there are legacy eﬀects. New cropping

    systems with improved management practices must be developed

    that contribute to environmental sustainability to minimize

    negative impacts on air, soil and water. In addition, advanced

    crop cultivars must be developed that better use soil nutrient

    and water resources, are more resistant to environmental stress

    (temperature extremes, drought, ﬂood, plant pathogens), and are

    packed with nutrients that are found deﬁcient in populations in

    Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture

    FIGURE 1 | The site-speciﬁc approach can be expanded to a three- dimensional scale

    the developing world (Bouis and Saltzman, 2017). This all must

    be done very rapidly as 30 years is not a long time when dealing

    with science and adoption of scientiﬁc technology. In other

    words, SPAE, which aims to preserve ecosystem services, must

    work with modern technologies and practices quickly through

    the rapid transfer of knowledge from the agricultural lab to

    the producer.

    Over the past several decades, Information Technology (IT)

    has been the disruptive force in industries by driving out

    market ineﬃciencies through automation and better decision

    support tools that require the inclusion of both the citizens

    and consumers in the process. Like all industries, agriculture

    has not been immune to the constant disruptions over the

    past century (e.g., introduction of the tractor, PA, PC, and

    new governance models for dealing with inelasticity of demand,

    etc.). However, recent advances in computing infrastructure,

    sensor technology, big data, and advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep

    Learning) suggest that a major disruption or paradigm shift

    is on the horizon, leading to opportunities for SPAE entering

    the mainstream in a smart, advanced system for SPAE. IT also

    holds the key for accelerating knowledge transfer from the lab to

    the producer.

    Eventually, a system based on these new technologies will

    be needed for mass transfer of genomic and other genetic

    data for the development of these advanced crop cultivars, for

    the management of agronomic data, and for the development

    of these next-generation production systems. Data generated

    from these cropping systems are inherently geospatial in that

    crop types and their environmental hardiness obviously vary

    regionally by latitude. Agricultural ﬁeld crop production inputs

    and conservation management to achieve sustainable systems

    can vary considerably over space and time (Pierce and Nowak,

    1999; Berry et al., 2003, 2005; Delgado and Berry, 2008;

    Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010). Therefore, monitoring crop and

    environmental performance will highly depend not only on

    traditional methods of Earth Observation (EO), but also data

    generated in situ (i.e., ground truth).

    Hence, geospatial solutions based on imagery from EO at all

    scales integrated with sensor networks will increasingly become

    critical for the operation of PA systems where resource inputs are

    applied at precise geo-speciﬁc ﬁeld locations based on crop need.

    Solutions will eventually be needed to allow immediate feedback

    from digital farm communities regarding the performance of

    these new cropping systems; speeding their development based

    on immediate feedback to the labs and other interested parties.

    To accomplish this, we describe a “system of systems” approach

    to building a scientiﬁc network that integrates the scientiﬁc and

    farming communities, based on a common, global IT platform

    (i.e., the cloud).

    HISTORICAL CHALLENGES IN

    AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY

    ADOPTION FOR PA

    Although PA has been around since the 1980s, the adoption of

    the technology has been slow. Schimmelphfenning (2016) reports

    that PA technology, for example, was used on about 30–50%

    of U.S. corn and soybean acres in 2012. Van der Wal (2019)

    suggests that the reason for poor adoption is due to the “growing

    complexity of adoption in the use of information technology”

    and the fact that “incomes in agriculture are generally low

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems | www.frontiersin.org

    3

    July 2019 | Volume 3 | Article 54

    Delgado et al.

    Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture

    and young generations seek their prosperity in cities,” implying

    that those with technical prowess are heading to the cities for

    hi-tech jobs that pay better. PA also tends to be expensive

    (Shama, 2017), which is reﬂected in the fact that it is mostly

    implemented on larger farms (Schimmelphfenning, 2016) which

    can aﬀord the complex and changing technology. However, low-

    tech precision agriculture/precision conservation approaches

    have been implemented by farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa,

    contributing to improved yields, incomes and conservation

    (Jenrich, 2011). There are numerous reasons for the low

    adoption rates and the next few sections oﬀer several common

    explanations. However, there are opportunities for leveraging

    existing technological trends.

    Poor Adoption of Decision Support Tools

    While the agricultural sector has a long tradition of relying on

    best practices rooted in science, the industry hasn’t always been

    an early adopter of decision support tools or extension services

    that resulted in speeding up the adoption of new precision

    agricultural practices (Rose et al., 2016). Ribaudo et al. (2011a)

    reported in a national study that 65 percent of the cropland

    studied (109 million acres) needed best practices for nitrogen

    management. There are several reasons for limited adoption

    including culture in the producer community, skills, current

    information management processes, etc. Perhaps the biggest

    reason, until recently, has been the limitations of both the

    technologies and agricultural systems models used to support PA,

    much less PC and SPAE (Antle et al., 2017). Speciﬁcally, Antle

    et al. (2017) states that “many advances in data, information

    and communication technology of the past decade have not

    been fully exploited... [because of the] underinvestment in

    agricultural research, particularly in non-proprietary public good

    research, and in research aiming to improve the well-being of

    poor, smallholder farm households in the developing world.”

    While user-centered design techniques in the IT industry will

    improve adoption, an active area of research exists to more

    quantitatively understand positive adoption of new practices

    (Kuehne et al., 2017).

    That being said, technology adoption challenges in the IT

    industry are well understood and noted by Moore (1991)

    who discusses the diﬀusion of innovation through groups

    of technologists, early adopters who see the possibilities of

    innovation, pragmatists who resist change until an economic

    beneﬁt is deﬁned, the late majority adopters who require low

    risk and high reliability, and the laggards. By utilizing targeted

    messaging, Silicon Valley and other tech centers’ success over the

    past few decades in disrupting markets is often attributed to the

    model cited in Moore (1991), which ironically had its roots in the

    study of farming practice adoption (Beal and Bohlen, 1957).

    Limitations of Earth Observation Data

    in Agriculture

    From a practical point of view, these historical technical

    limitations in the past have ranged from lack of standards,

    non-scalable systems, cost of sensors, and limited support

    from governments around the use of EO in agriculture

    or remotely sensed data that focused on climate change

    observations as opposed to agriculture. Although there was

    early adoption in agriculture in the US through programs

    like

    AgRISTARS

    and

    LACIE

    in

    the

    1970s/80s

    (Pinter

    et al., 2003), the Landsat series, for example, primarily

    focused on moderate spatial resolution (i.e., 30 × 30 m),

    which

    while

    good

    for

    crop

    monitoring

    at

    the

    macro

    level, was too course for PA. Luccio (2014) suggests that

    “...farm

    management

    decisions,

    such

    as

    weed

    detection

    and management, require imagery with a spatial resolution

    in the order of centimeters and, for emergent situations

    (such as to monitor nutrient stress and disease), a temporal

    resolution of <24 h.”

    Likewise, these moderate resolution satellites, which were

    primarily designed for answering scientiﬁc questions, haven’t

    always focused on the appropriate spectral bands (e.g., red edge

    band) for agriculture or frequency of data acquisition to make

    it easy to monitor crop growth during the growing season.

    Yet, because of the global coverage, these satellite networks

    have been recognized as the original generators of big data

    and represented a compromise or trade-oﬀ between spatial

    resolution and storage capacity. In recent years, commercial

    satellites, such as those from DigitalGlobe, which serve a variety

    of markets beyond agriculture have promised to ﬁll the gaps

    made from the public-sponsored platforms. However, the cost

    and complexity of using these data have been limiting factors

    at the producer level for all but the large farm operations who

    can justify data costs. As a result much of the use of remote

    sensing data has come in the past from aerial platforms and

    now from drones carrying small sensors focused on frequent

    observations over the growing season. Although at a limited

    coverage area, the cost of entry can be considered high for

    smaller farms operations in the US and, especially in the

    developing world creating a logistics problem of sensor and

    data exchange.

    Poor Communication Infrastructure

    In addition to the diﬃculty arising from a variety of remote

    sensing data from multiple sensors, the lack of a comprehensive

    backbone for high-bandwidth transmission of data to remote

    farm areas has limited the ability of the exchange of data between

    the farm and value-added services. In the US broadband adoption

    promises to solve this problem with bandwidth at the megabyte

    level, but small farm operations in low-income countries will

    have to rely on alternative architectures that utilize local sensor

    networks. Tyler and Griﬃn (2016) argues that “The realization

    of ‘Big Data’s’ value will not happen until [the data transfer

    bandwidth] barrier is overcome.” On the surface, PA looks to

    not be a big generator of data for upload. Tyler and Griﬃn

    (2016) suggests otherwise for just corn alone, where for each

    plant generating 0.5 k bytes, the 88.9 million acres in 2015 would

    generate 1.3 petabytes of data, not including the notorious big

    data generator from aerial drones. Upload bandwidth will clearly

    be needed.

    Siloed Data Management

    Given the variety of data and limitations of bandwidth in many

    farming communities, it’s not surprising that data management

    has also been an issue. First, the public remote sensing platforms,

    whose data generation capabilities have led to data archives at

    the exabyte (i.e., 1018 bytes) and above levels, have resulted in

    driving the public sector to invest into large data systems in

    order to serve a wide scientiﬁc community. These systems, while

    good at disseminating data, still require extensive and complex

    knowledge of a variety of satellites and sensors, ﬁle formats,

    meta data standards, physics, etc. (Blumenfeld, 2019). In short,

    it still does require considerable expertise to gain any signiﬁcant

    agricultural beneﬁts from these systems.

    Second, commercial satellite, aerial, and drone-based data

    systems, while somewhat easier to use, are still fragmented due

    to competing interests. In the end, the variety of data formats,

    velocity of data coming oﬀ of a variety of platforms, and volume

    of data generated have led to a fragmented and siloed data

    management infrastructure for agriculture. In other words, this is

    a Big Data problem, which is formally deﬁned as a combination

    of a variety of data, the velocity of data and/or the volume of data.

    Given the inherently spatial nature of agriculture and remotely

    sensed data, GIS oﬀered the opportunity to minimize data siloes

    by providing spatial context (i.e., maps) around data. This has

    led to a proliferation of GIS systems that span topic areas well

    beyond remotely sensed data, yet has led to additional silos of

    geospatial information.

    Immature Applications of Analytics and AI

    While data silos are not inherently a problem per se, techniques

    including those from analytics, AI and Machine Learning, require

    that the data be readily accessible, coherent, and consistent

    before these algorithms can provide any value. Certainly,

    ﬁrst-generation solutions like the world wide web and data

    warehouses have gone a long way in connecting these data siloes,

    but they fell short in addressing the computational capacity

    necessary for analytic techniques. These challenges made it

    diﬃcult to apply analytic techniques comprehensively such as

    yield forecasting and all the other advanced techniques tried in

    the scientiﬁc literature.

    The problem is further exacerbated when considering SPAE

    and modeling. In PA, applications focus on connection of inputs

    to needs in order to determine the action based on a spatial

    area. That is, while there is some modeling going on, it’s

    relatively simple in that a precision map shows exactly where

    to apply the fertilizer, water, etc. SA, which places emphasis

    on complex interactions between biological systems, tends to

    have more complex models that are crafted carefully by the

    scientiﬁc ﬁeld. Consider the Denitriﬁcation and Decomposition

    (DNDC) model used in the simulation of carbon and nitrogen

    biogeochemistry through complex interactions of soil, crop

    growth/decomposition, etc. to predict, among other things,

    nitrate leaching and C/N greenhouse gas emissions (Salas, 2010;

    University of New Hampshire, 2012). Whereas initial PA eﬀorts

    may not be as focused on assessing greenhouse emissions from

    agriculture, this more complicated model or analytic technique

    is an example of one that could contribute to achieving the

    objectives of SPAE and, as such, requires a strong source of

    “regional databases...for mapping and potentially monitoring

    management practices...for compliance, veriﬁcation, or tracking

    sustainability” (Salas, 2010).

    Another recent example is the COMET-Farm system web-

    based tool developed by Paustian et al. (2018) to do full

    greenhouse gas assessments for CO2, CH4, and N2O from

    all major on-farm emission sources as well as assessments of

    soil carbon sequestration. This web-based tool can assess GHG

    emissions from perennial crops, pasture, range and agroforestry

    systems, as well as emissions from livestock and on-farm energy

    use (Paustian et al., 2018). This tool can be used to assess

    PC practices. The user could upload a custom soil map that

    can specify sub-ﬁeld map units, allowing the user to deﬁne

    spatially explicit management zones (Paustian et al., 2018). An

    application could be added in the future to assess the eﬀects

    of PA and PC on GHG emissions (Paustian et al., 2018). Saleh

    and Osei (2018) reported that the Comprehensive Economic

    Environmental Optimization Tool (CEEOT) and the more

    user-friendly Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) can be used at a

    watershed level to assess the optimal conservation practices,

    using a PC approach to maximize the beneﬁt from each dollar

    of conservation practice investment. They reported that by

    using spatial distributions of ﬁeld attributes such as soil type,

    topography, and soil chemical and physical properties, PC can

    be applied to reduce the uncertainty of where to apply a

    given practice to increase conservation eﬀectiveness and thus

    sustainability (Saleh and Osei, 2018).

    Regional databases are equally as critical for building accurate

    machine-learning algorithms. In the geospatial world, early

    applications of AI focused on classiﬁcation of imagery such

    as Landsat (Campbell et al., 1989), which led to applications

    mostly around macroeconomic crop forecasting, as is done by

    the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National

    Agricultural Statistics Service. Figure 2 illustrates the problem

    through the classiﬁcations of cropland (yellow), forest (green),

    and roadways (gray) in the left picture, where even a casual

    inspection shows misclassiﬁcation of the entire farm in the

    polygon. When taken at a national or global level, these

    classiﬁcation error rates may well be within statistical tolerances

    for macroeconomic problems, but clearly fertilizing the road or

    farm buildings would not be acceptable in the left picture. The

    picture to the right on higher resolution data (NAIP) from a

    recent use of machine learning in the cloud shows drastically

    improved classiﬁcation (Tayyebi, 2019) due to not only higher

    spatial resolution data but also signiﬁcant computational capacity

    in today’s cloud environment.

    In either case, Campbell et al. (1994) and Short et al. (1995)

    recognized early that regional databases needed to be developed

    as a mechanism for providing training data to machine-learning

    algorithms, which capture local knowledge from diﬀerent

    individuals or organizations (e.g., farmers). In other words,

    these classiﬁcation techniques rely heavily on supervised learning

    where training datasets consisting of known classiﬁcation labels

    associated with spectral properties (i.e., spectral signature) are

    presented to the algorithms, which generalize or learn.

    In the 1990s, NASA recognized the need to develop a

    network of distributed, end-to-end satellite processing centers,

    called Regional Application Centers, in order to leverage local

    knowledge in the building of training datasets for localized

    machine-learning implementations. Implemented around the

    world in countries with no interconnectivity at the time

    (i.e., the internet), NASA deployed low-cost, high-performance

    technology to acquire data directly from the satellites with direct

    broadcast capability and perform all the necessary processing

    routines including machine learning, in order to produce spatial

    information products for not only NASA but also the local

    and international governments (Campbell et al., 1994; Davis

    et al., 1994; Short and Dickens, 1995). Because the mission areas

    ranged from hurricane forecasting to early applications of PA,

    the network of regional data centers demonstrated a coexistence

    between science goals and operation mission eﬀectiveness that

    resulted in, for example, an “early warning [that] allowed the

    movement of over 200,000 people [in Bangladesh] to higher

    elevation thereby avoiding certain drowning due to ﬂooding”

    (Campbell et al., 1994).

    The Paradigm Shift: Digital Agriculture

    Research and industry could solve many of these problems

    given the inherent nature of PA as a simple business solution

    of minimizing input costs through big data management in

    order to maximize yield and proﬁts in a commodity-based

    industry. In a recent Bloomberg article (Noel, 2019) argues

    that companies like Bayer can acquire data from the farm,

    process it with analytics, and sell it back to the producers. With

    advances in the cloud where computational power and storage

    are relatively inexpensive, companies will probably move into a

    new era of selling information products by coalescing many of

    the aforementioned data sources, thereby reducing siloes and the

    knowledge complexity of operating the variety of data generators.

    However, SPAE is diﬀerent due to its focus on more

    environmentally friendly techniques and reliance on natural

    farming practices that require a level of complexity beyond

    simple input/outcome optimizations. Not only are the techniques

    less scientiﬁcally understood, but the potential improvements in

    yield may not generate the economic beneﬁts required to justify

    the increased complexity and costs in the short run, such as

    the aforementioned analytic complexity for SPAE alone. With

    that said, recent advances in PC to increase SPAE has shown

    that there is potential for some quick proﬁts when conservation

    practices use these new technologies. For example, Thompson

    and Sudduth (2018) reported that using PA tools oﬀers an

    advantage in both designing and utilizing terracing and contour

    farming approaches to conservation management by reducing

    terrace layout time by 50%, contributing to savings in time and

    money. Thompson and Sudduth (2018) also reported that using

    PA will contribute to economic sustainability of these systems by

    using ﬁeld machines that utilize GPS guidance and automatic row

    or section control.

    New opportunities may also be possible if ecosystem markets

    are developed where nitrogen, carbon, or even reduction of GHG

    can be traded in market systems, providing additional income

    to farmers due to implementation of conservation practices

    (Ribaudo et al., 2005, 2011a,b; Delgado et al., 2008, 2010; Paustian

    et al., 2018; Saleh and Osei, 2018). Paustian et al. (2018) reported

    that GHG mitigation, carbon storage, and water ﬁltration, for

    example, could potentially be appreciated and monetized, but it

    will then bring greater complexity to the decision-making and

    management choices of farmers and ranchers; it will also require

    tools and technologies that have not previously been available to

    agricultural producers. Delgado et al. (2008, 2010) reported that

    a GIS nitrogen trading tool could potentially assess the spatial

    eﬀects of implementation of conservation practices on reductions

    in nitrate leaching and direct and indirect GHG emissions that

    could be traded in air and water quality markets. Saleh and Osei

    (2018) reported that we could use spatial tools to assess the eﬀects

    of conservation practices and how PC could be used to generate

    credits for water quality markets and to specify, for example,

    if the credits will be for sediment load reduction or nitrogen

    or phosphorus reduction. Saleh and Osei (2018) reported that

    by using PC there will be a reduction in the “margin of safety”

    credit adjustments necessary for water quality trades, improving

    the water quality trading options for farmers. As suggested in

    Campbell et al. (1994) around Distributed AI techniques for

    automated cooperative systems, we propose that by using AI and

    the new SPAE approach and technology there will be greater

    opportunities to make SPAE generate income in these trading

    systems for farmers and ranchers, and increase ﬁeld, watershed,

    national, and global conservation.

    The rest of this paper argues that big data analytics is

    at the core of combining precision and sustainability into

    an earlier notion of Sustainable Agriculture

    (Berry et al.,

    2003, 2005; Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2004; Delgado

    and Berry, 2008). Berry et al. (2003) reported that precision

    conservation will be needed to maintain the productivity of

    intensive agricultural systems and global sustainability. Berry

    et al. (2003) also reported that precision conservation has the

    potential to integrate conservation practices at a site-speciﬁc ﬁeld

    level with oﬀ-site conservation practices, which would contribute

    to watershed sustainability. To support this argument, we will

    focus on both farm management and a geoinformatics cloud

    framework as a step toward global agricultural sustainability.

    Part of the PA concept to increase the eﬃciency of fertilizers

    has been the use of a 4 Rs approach to reduce nutrient losses

    from farming systems (the right product, at the right rate, at

    the right time, and at the right place (Roberts, 2007). However,

    Delgado (2016) reported that the 4 Rs are not enough and gave

    examples where signiﬁcant losses of nutrients and soil could

    occur without precision conservation (Figure 3). The concept

    of agricultural sustainability using a precision conservation

    approach in agriculture presented by Berry et al. (2003) will

    contribute to reduced oﬀ-site impacts across a watershed by using

    these new technologies to improve the design of conservation

    practices and increase the eﬃciencies of conservation practices

    such as ﬁeld buﬀers, sediment traps, denitriﬁcation traps, and

    riparian buﬀers to minimize the losses of nutrients from the

    ﬁeld and across a watershed. Cox (2005) reported that the Berry

    et al. (2003) PC concept could also be described using a 4 Rs

    approach, by applying the right conservation practice, at the

    right place, at the right time, and at the right scale (the 4 Rs of

    conservation). Delgado (2016) combined these 4 Rs of precision

    farming with the 4 Rs of precision conservation to create the 7 Rs

    for nutrient management and conservation, which are applying

    the right product (1), the right rate (2) and the right method

    of fertilizer application (3), the right conservation practice (4)

    placed at the right place (5) and right scale (6), with the right time

    of application of fertilizer and establishment of the conservation

    practice (7). We propose that we could use new Big Data analytics

    to combine precision agriculture and precision conservation

    (Berry et al., 2003, 2005; Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer,

    2004; Delgado and Berry, 2008) to achieve SPAE. This is similar

    to the 7 Rs approach described by Delgado (2016) and Sassenrath

    and Delgado (2018).

    MODERN FARM MANAGEMENT

    With the emergence of commercial viability of PA over the past

    few decades, today’s developed world farmer is moving from a

    grower and distributor of produce to a modern day data scientist

    who must utilize analytic techniques to both collect the right data

    at the right time, but also apply advanced information products to

    increase yield. Acting in the role of an early adopter of technology

    (Moore, 1991), today’s farmer will have to quickly learn how

    these new technologies can be used to help make decisions about

    how to increase proﬁts by increasing yields or implementing

    precision management and conservation practices that could

    produce sustainability beneﬁts that could potentially be traded

    in ecosystem service markets. The use of this new technology for

    SPAE will be dominated in the future by analytic techniques and

    AI to help provide solutions to complex problems and decisions.

    Today’s “early majority” farmer is increasingly aware of

    the role of cost externalities as they relate to input costs

    and will act as the bridge from the early adopter technology

    community. For example, whether it is organic farms that must

    deal with cross-species contamination from neighboring farms

    or the increased externalities from management practices that

    contribute to emissions of GHG or losses of agrochemicals

    that could impact water quality, or weather impacts on erosion

    and loss of productivity, farming must increasingly deal with

    long-term factors that may not show up immediately in

    increased yield proﬁts but that will contribute to reduced

    yields if they remain unchecked. Using precision conservation

    to increase the sustainability of agricultural systems will

    contribute to adaptation to a changing climate and maintaining

    long-term

    productivity.

    In

    other

    words,

    sustainability

    in

    agriculture is increasingly becoming a necessary component of

    today’s agricultural practices. Organizations like USDA’s Natural

    Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) have long known that

    conservation programs are methods for removing the cost

    burden of externalities, but with decreased public sector budgets,

    this is becoming more diﬃcult as external costs increase.

    Managing nutrients at a farm level is very important since

    losses of reactive nitrogen at this level signiﬁcantly impact the

    environment via emissions of nitrous oxide, ammonia emissions,

    nitrate leaching losses, and oﬀ-site transport of surface losses

    of nitrogen (Smith et al., 1997; U.S. Environmental Protection

    Agency, 2010). Nitrogen losses signiﬁcantly impact terrestrial

    resources, water bodies, and the atmosphere (Hutchinson et al.,

    1982; Legg and Meisinger, 1982; Cowling et al., 2002; Rabalais

    et al., 2002a,b; Galloway et al., 2008; Dubrovsky et al., 2010). It

    has been documented that these losses contribute to signiﬁcant

    impacts such as impacts on species composition and the

    functioning of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems,

    among others (Matson et al., 1997; Vitousek et al., 1997). Reactive

    nitrogen could also negatively impact human health (Follett

    et al., 2010). In addition to signiﬁcant environmental impacts,

    these losses can also have negative economic impacts. Ribaudo

    et al. (2011a) reported that the cost of removing agriculture’s

    contribution to nitrate loadings in drinking water in the USA is

    about $1.7 billion per year.

    Fortunately,

    organizations

    like

    USDA’s

    NRCS

    and

    private consultants have been increasing the use of these

    new

    technologies

    that

    contribute

    to

    implementation

    of

    conservation practices on the ground to achieve precision

    conservation. Precision conservation is increasingly being

    embraced by agencies such as NRCS and the private sector in

    a new revolutionary approach that is increasing conservation

    eﬀectiveness (USDA-NRCS, 2017). Some of the USDA ARS’

    voluntary conservation programs such as the Environmental

    Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) can be used to implement

    precision conservation (USDA-NRCS, USDA-NRCS). There are

    several examples of private sector and non-proﬁt organization

    implementation

    of

    precision

    conservation

    to

    increase

    sustainability (Buman, 2016a,b; Hammes, 2016; Heartland

    Science Technology Group, 2017; Chesapeake Conservancy,

    2018; Illinois Sustainable Ag Partnership, 2018).

    There is a revolution going on in the agricultural landscape,

    making it possible to move agricultural science from on-site

    research facilities directly to the farm. Farmers are no longer

    passive recipients of information but are rather actively involved

    in the science and development of new crop production systems

    that can either be yield neutral or possibly improve yield. Over

    the long run, this paradigm shift could reduce the need for

    public subsidies for external costs, as they would be an automatic

    byproduct of agricultural best practices.

    As suggested in Wolfert et al. (2017) (Figure 4), the key to the

    modern farm is the application of big data to the development of

    a smart farm and smart soil and water conservation (Sassenrath

    and Delgado, 2018). The smart farm and smart soil and water

    conservation conceptual frameworks focus on the cyber-physical

    management cycle built around a cloud-based infrastructure that

    manages all farm operations. Where bandwidth is plenty (i.e.,

    due to rural broadband), then the farmer operates as a data

    collector transmitting to the cloud for spatially-based analytic

    techniques that tell the farmer what to do and when based on

    looking at the macro variables across the farm landscape (e.g.,

    weather input prediction).

    For agriculture in the developed world, Unmanned Aerial

    Vehicles (UAV) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)

    armed with hyper-spectral and other sensor types generate

    signiﬁcant amounts of data that can be processed remotely

    enabling a variety of advanced analytic techniques that can

    drive the application of inputs automatically. Computer visions

    techniques are increasingly being used on applications like

    weed vs. crop detection (Lin et al., 2017), planting, irrigation,

    pruning, harvesting, and plant disease detection/identiﬁcation

    (Ampatzidis et al., 2017), leading to the potential for further

    automation and minimizing of labor input costs.

    Where bandwidth is limited, especially in the developing

    world, computation must be pushed to the edge where

    information products are produced in situ and only small

    data volume information products are exchanged between the

    cloud and farmer if at all. Referred to as edge computing,

    this “distributed computing paradigm....brings computer data

    storage closer to the location where it is needed” (Edge Wiki)2

    and is possible to the drastic drops in price/performance for

    hardware. In the context of agriculture, this means that machine

    learning algorithms that are developed in the cloud can be pushed

    to the edge for farm operations.

    A powerful example of this model can be found in

    Microsoft’s FarmBeats program (Vasisht et al., 2017). Rather

    than wait for governments or private industry to invest in

    connectivity programs like rural broadband, FarmBeats “piggy

    backs” oﬀ of T.V. whitespaces3, which are frequencies allocated

    to broadcasting service but not locally used, especially in rural

    areas. FarmBeats deploys a ﬁeld sensor array to collect variables

    (e.g., soil moisture) where the machine learning is used to

    impute or predict data points from sensor nodes and brief

    ﬂy overs from UAVs. By building on inexpensive and reliable

    hardware, FarmBeats addresses the “late majority’s” market

    need for simplicity and low risk, thereby facilitating technology

    adoption (Moore, 1991). As a result, FarmBeats has already been

    deployed internationally in countries like India, New Zealand,

    and Kenya, resulting in a reported 30% reduction in water

    consumption (Sims, 2019).

    Based on trends in farm operations and management, farms

    are becoming the new Big Data generator that complements

    much of the EO data that has been gathered to date. With

    these advances architecturally in farm management, the modern

    farm can resemble the notion of “Digital Twins”, which is the

    conﬂuence of IoT, AI, and big data. [Digital Twin Wiki]4 deﬁnes

    a digital twin as “a digital replica of a living or non-living

    physical entity” that is used “to create living digital simulation

    models that update and change as their physical counterparts

    change.” In terms of agriculture and farm management, digital

    twins means that “farm operations would no longer require

    physical proximity, which allows for remote monitoring, control

    and coordination of farm operations” (Verdouw and Kruize,

    2015). From a SPAE perspective, simulation models like the

    aforementioned DNDC, COMET-Farm, CEEOT, and/or the

    NTT models are among some of the available tools that could

    be used to form the basis of ensuring the least impact on

    environment without driving up costs.

    A GEOINFORMATICS SUSTAINABLE

    AGRICULTURE FRAMEWORK

    Regardless of the approaches, clearly today’s farms are quickly

    becoming data generators that when stitched together spatially

    provide a higher resolution view into the agricultural industry,

    which ultimately will provide a more precise view of not only

    global food security but overall environmental sustainability.

    Governments currently have to rely heavily on EO data to

    estimate crop yield as it relates to food security and market

    predictions, which is an indirect indicator of sustainability

    more from an economic than environmental perspective. This

    has certainly been the goal of USDA’s Global Agricultural

    & Disaster Assessment System (GADAS), which uses satellite

    imagery “to assist in...agricultural estimates of global crop

    conditions” (Frantz, n.d.).

    GADAS represents a ﬁrst-generation system that potentially

    forms the foundation for a broader public/private partnership of

    connecting farm data generators to an interconnected framework

    for sustainability. Or namely, it brings together a variety of

    spatial data via a GIS to illustrate impacts of weather, water,

    crop conditions, land use, etc. to give a global assessment of

    agriculture (Figure 5). In fact, the US Federal government is

    starting to recognize the need for governance of geospatial data

    from a comprehensive point-of-view. Through the Geospatial

    Data Act (GDA), the intent of the act is to “coordinate and work

    in partnership with other Federal agencies, agencies of State,

    tribal, and local governments, institutions of higher education,

    and the private sector to eﬃciently and cost-eﬀectively collect,

    integrate, maintain, disseminate, and preserve geospatial data,

    4Digital Twin Wiki. Available online at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin

    building upon existing non-Federal geospatial data to the extent

    possible” (URISA, 2018). In other words, the GDA provides a

    governance framework for bringing together billions of dollars

    of investment in geospatial data from a variety of environmental

    and military mission areas.

    Jack Dangermond from Esri established the vision for

    a geospatial infrastructure so that “users can easily and

    inexpensively

    access

    an

    immense

    wealth

    of

    geographic

    information

    cloud

    computing

    resources

    to

    perform

    analysis

    and

    mapping”

    (Dangermond, 2018). Technologically, this means providing a

    platform for connecting existing GIS systems together into a

    new architectural pattern referred to as WebGIS. The WebGIS

    pattern supports multiple implementation patterns from the

    on Farm, edge-oriented architecture presented in the previous

    section to a “system of systems” spread across the private and

    public sector.

    From an agricultural perspective, WebGIS provides a

    framework for reducing past siloes not only across the

    public sector agencies, but also between the public sector

    and agricultural industry. USDA’s Agricultural Research Service

    (ARS) has taken a lead in breaking down these silos by

    leveraging WebGIS. Although in its early stages, the Agricultural

    Collaborative Research Outcome System (AgCROS) illustrates

    the vision of collaboration by providing a single platform for

    the dissemination of new agricultural scientiﬁc discoveries and

    techniques (Delgado et al., 2018b). AgCROS was built based on

    individual ARS national research projects. These projects studied

    areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, soil health, genomics,

    cover crops, renewable energy, antibiotic resistance, nutrient use

    and nutrition (Del Grosso et al., 2013; Delgado et al., 2016;

    Delgado et al., 2018b).

    Sustaining the Earth’s Watersheds, Agricultural Research Data

    System (STEWARDS) started the ARS multilocation national

    natural resource projects. STEWARDS used what is now called

    WebGIS, but each location had its own measurement vocabulary,

    so location cross comparison was not possible (Steiner et al.,

    2009). STEWARDS did introduce a measurement methods

    catalog which is a very important component in any of these

    systems. The Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural

    Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet) was the ﬁrst project

    to show true collaboration among scientists (Del Grosso et al.,

    2013). GRACEnet, also used a WebGIS. GRACEnet showed

    that through collaboration among the scientists, a way to build

    up a common vocabulary of measurements for greenhouse gas

    emissions. This has been key in building systems around each of

    these individual projects since for ARS. GIS provided a way to

    relate all this data based on location. The addition of metadata

    for public discovery and measurement methods now allow the

    individual location data to be combined to look at trends across

    ARS research locations. The next steps for AgCROS will be

    adding imagery, real time sensors, and electronic ﬁeld collection

    to allow more data to be added with the goal of allowing the

    machine learning techniques discussed above to be realized.

    More importantly, it promotes the integration of agricultural

    knowledge using the WebGIS pattern in order to promote

    collaboration across government, industry and academia. In

    other words, it is the mechanism for speeding up the adoption of

    Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture

    FIGURE 5 | The Global Agricultural and Disaster Assessment System (GADAS) is a
    GIS system that provides data about global crop conditions based on satellite

    imagery and remotely sensed data [USDA-FAS].

    new crop production techniques to the smart farm, which can in

    turn deliver higher quality data back to the scientiﬁc community

    for enabling sound science. In eﬀect, these aforementioned

    systems along with a smart farm network suggest that WebGIS

    could, in fact, become the Digital Twin for the Globe. In this way,

    such a system would facilitate the transparency of environmental

    costs and reduce cost externalities based on real-data from

    monitoring systems down to the farm/producer, thereby enabling

    more data-driven policy making.

    CONCLUSION

    Precision Agriculture emerged out of the 1980s because of the

    development of several key technologies as a way to improve

    margin through cost management of inputs while improving

    yield. Development of precision-conservation practices started

    in the early 2000s. New technologies like GPS, satellite imagery,

    and new methods of genetic modiﬁcation in the green revolution

    have represented a disruption in agriculture not seen since the

    introduction of the ﬁrst successful commercial tractor in the

    early 1900s and the green revolution that occurred between

    1950 and the late 1960s. With the increasing impact of climate

    change, this paper has argued that the next revolution in

    precision agriculture will be driven by SPAE which could

    leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis.

    Among other positive impacts, SPAE will contribute to increased

    yields and proﬁts, increased adaptation to a changing climate,

    increased sustainability of agricultural systems, and increased

    sustainability outside of the ﬁeld and across watersheds, reducing

    nutrient transport across watersheds and contributing to

    global sustainability.

    While the traditional deﬁnition of sustainable agriculture

    focused on incorporating new practices that deal with ecosystem

    services, this new, technology-focused sustainable agriculture

    transitions from a site-speciﬁc management focus to the notion

    of global sustainability. To accomplish this transition, we

    introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing principle

    that connects local, site-speciﬁc data generators called smart

    farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can support

    both the agriculture industry and policy makers in government.

    Automation and the use of AI, IoT, drones, robots, and Big

    Data serve as a basis for “Digital Twins,” which could allow

    for simulations of new ideas that can be tested virtually to

    determine environmental impact before implementation in the

    real world. In other words, constructing new practices in the

    virtual world will reduce the time to deploy new practices that

    lead to better environmental outcomes. If we are to feed 10 billion

    people by 2100 while preserving our environment, the next green

    revolution must incorporate the virtual world.

    is driving the digital revolution. AlSome palliative measures aremost all economic
    sectors are becoming “Smart” thanks to the analysis of data generated by IoT.
    This analysis is carried out by advance artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    that provide insights never before imagined. The combination of both IoT and AI
    is giving rise to an emerging trend, called AIoT, which is opening up new paths
    to bring digitization into the new era. However, there is still a big gap between
    AI and IoT, which is basically in the computational power required by the former
    and the lack of computational resources offered by the latter. This is particularly
    true in rural IoT environments where the lack of connectivity (or low-bandwidth
    connections) and power supply forces the search for “efficient” alternatives to
    provide computational resources to IoT infrastructures without increasing power
    consumption. In this paper, we explore edge computing as a solution for bridging
    the gaps between AI and IoT in rural environment. We evaluate the training and
    inference stages of a deep-learning-based precision agriculture application for
    frost prediction in modern Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier in terms of performance and
    power consumption. Our experimental results reveal that cloud approaches are still
    a long way off in terms of performance, but the inclusion of GPUs in edge devices
    offers new opportunities for those scenarios where connectivity is still a challenge.

    Article 05 March 2022 1 Introduction Smart agriculture is an emerging field where
    the concepts, techniques and systems of Industry 4.0 are applied to the agrarian
    world [10]. The combination of both IoT and AI provides sustainable procedures
    to optimize crops, reduce the use of pesticides, optimize irrigation and, in general,
    avoid the most egregious problems in agricultural processes [6, 28, 29, 38]. Of
    particular interest to us is the prevention of frost. In Mediterranean areas,
    low temperatures at certain times of the agricultural cycle are a major problem
    that can result in losses of millions of euros. 1 However, it is not an easy task
    as it depends on several factors, including temperature, humidity, wind speed,
    etc. [30], but also on the particular location of the plot. Actually, the global
    weather forecast provides coarse grain information which is not valid to predict
    frost at the plot level. Some palliative measures are available to avoid crop
    loss, such as connecting windmills and stoves or connecting heating in a greenhouse
    to avoid crop losses. However, these measures need to be activated some time in
    advance, between 2 and 4 h, to be really effective. Therefore, this is a scenario
    where both accuracy and performance are equally critical. A false positive, i.e.,
    the application predicts a frost but eventually does not occur, means an economic
    and environmental impact, as these techniques are often too costly in both terms.
    A false negative, i.e., the application does not predict a frost but eventually
    occurs, can mean the loss of the crop which usually has dramatic consequences.
    Equally important is to predict the frost early enough in order to be able to
    take palliative actions, because otherwise, the consequences would be the same.
    Deep Learning is a area within machine learning which relies on a set of artificial
    neural networks organized as complex hierarchical levels [11]. Deep learning models
    are applied in agriculture to deal with problems such as the automatic identification
    of plant disease through images or yield predictions in crops [19]. In the field
    of deep learning, Long short-term memory (LSTM) [18] is a recurrent neural network
    (RNN), first proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, which has feedback connections.
    LSTM goes beyond processing single data points such as images, but also entire
    sequences of data such as speech, video or time-series data in general. Thus,
    they are well suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on
    data capture from IoT infrastructures [26]. In our previous work, an IoT system
    was proposed to obtain fine-grained information from a particular plot area [15]
    and some prepossessing tasks were carried out to remove outliers and out-of-range
    values. Moreover, we develop a deep learning model for the frost prediction based
    on a long short-term memory (LSTM) with satisfactory accuracy results, i.e., an
    average quadratic error of less than a Celsius degree and a determination coefficient
    \(R^{2}\) greater than 0.95 [14]. However, the computational cost of this model
    was too high and therefore it should be executed offline. This limits the success
    of this technique of because several reasons. The IoT infrastructure should be
    connected to the Internet with high-speed connection or, at least, with a minimum
    number of cloud outages. This is actually not the scenario in rural areas where
    IoT infrastructures are often found in inhospitable conditions, where high temperatures,
    lack of connectivity and security are just a few examples that limit the existence
    of responsive Web services. With a low-bandwidth connection plus the training
    and inference time of the LSTM model in the cloud, the maximum prediction window
    allowed for decision making (i.e., 2–3 h) would be difficult to achieve. Edge
    computing [32] is an emerging area where processing in close proximity to mobile
    devices or sensors may provide energy savings, highly responsive Web services
    for mobile computing, scalability and privacy-policy enforcement for the Internet
    of Things, as well as the ability to mask transient cloud outages. Indeed, edge
    computing platforms are designed to be energy efficient and therefore performance
    is not their primary objective. Some computing platforms are emerging to enable
    edge computing with a reduced power budget and ever-increasing performance. Among
    them, we may highlight Nvidia Jetson family which can run between 7.5 and 10 W
    of power, offering a good performance ratio [17]. In this article, we provide
    a performance and energy evaluation of edge vs. cloud computing platforms for
    a LSTM deep learning model to predict the possibility of frost in crops, taking
    as input data captured from an IoT system. The main contributions of this paper
    include the following: 1. The LSTM model for frost prediction previously published
    in [14] has been adapted to be executed on high-end and low-power GPUs. 2. CPU
    and GPU code is evaluated in terms of performance and power on the Nvidia Jetson
    AGX Xavier to find out whether the inclusion of GPUs on the edge devices is a
    compelling alternative for running heavy workloads like the LSTM model. The GPU-based
    code of out LSTM model shows 1.6x speedup factor compared to multicore counterpart
    version. 3. We also compare the edge solution with its cloud-based counterpart
    for both stages: training and inference, showing that Nvidia Jetson may offer
    enough computational horsepower to create an autonomous decision support systems
    for frost prediction. Training could be developed during the warmest part of the
    day when frost is unlikely to occur and inference can be made from midday. 4.
    The quality of the results obtained is also evaluated to ensure that our version
    of the GPU draws similar conclusions to its CPU counterpart. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. Section 2 shows the necessary background to better understand
    our proposal. Section 3 introduces the deep learning model based on LSTM to predict
    temperature. Section 4 includes the empirical results in which both quality and
    performance evaluations are presented. Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and
    gives some directions for future work. 2 Background 2.1 Edge versus cloud computing
    Since the early days, computing has alternated between centralization and decentralization.
    At the beginning, batch processing and time-sharing prevailed in a centralized
    fashion. With the advent of personal computing in the 1980s, we then move to a
    decentralized approach that was centralized again in the mid-2000s through the
    cloud. Nowadays, cloud computing is established as the most obvious infrastructure
    to leverage from a mobile device. However, the optimal cloud infrastructure may
    be too far away from the mobile device. Li et al. show the average round trip
    time from 260 global vantage points to their optimal Amazon EC2 instances was
    74 ms [24]. In addition, the latency of the wireless first hop should be added.
    Therefore, in some emergent applications, this latency is not tolerable and some
    authors pointed out the necessity of moving again toward distribution. Satyanarayanan
    et al. [32] propose two-level architecture to look for mobile applications'' interactive
    performance. The first level was the unmodified cloud computing architecture,
    and a second level was a network of dispersed elements called cloudlets with state
    cached from the first level [33]. Moreover, Bonomi et al, motivated by IoT infrastructure
    scalability instead, introduced the term fog computing that consists again of
    a multilevel hierarchy of fog nodes spanning from the cloud to IoT edge devices
    [4]. As stated in [32], the proximity of cloudlets (or fog nodes) provides different
    benefits but of particular interest to us are two of them: 1. Highly responsive
    cloud services, achieving low end-to-end latency, high bandwidth and low jitter
    to services located on the edge. Edge computing brings, through cloudlets, computational
    power within one wireless hop of sensors or mobile devices. Indeed, applications
    that are both latency-sensitive and computation-intensive would not become possible
    without this technology. Interactive mobile applications such as virtual or augmented
    are leading examples. 2. Scalability via edge analytics, lowering the bandwidth
    required by high-data-rate IoT sensors processing applications. Reducing the amount
    of information to be transferred to the cloud through a data analytics on the
    edge may avoid network overloading and may provide energy saves. A leading example
    of this is GigaSight framework [35] where video from mobile devices only goes
    to the nearby cloudlet. The cloudlet runs computer vision application and sends
    the results and some metadata to the cloud, reducing drastically the application
    bandwidth. Edge computing is a compelling alternative to enable smart environments
    in agriculture ubiquitously. Actually, agriculture procedures are usually developed
    in rural areas where several technological challenges often cohabit. Among them,
    we may highlight technical issues such as bandwidth, connectivity, power supply
    and scaling sensors but also environmental issues that complicate the deployment
    of IoT, such as extreme weather conditions. Some recent works have carried out
    studies considering edge computing for smart agriculture or farming. For instance,
    Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [36] proposes a platform to deal with soilless culture
    needs in full recirculation greenhouses using moderately saline water. Edge computing
    here is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the access network
    to increase system reliability against network access failures. However, they
    do not introduce computationally heavy workloads such as deep learning models
    at this level as they require higher computational horsepower. Singh, Chana and
    Buya propose Agri-Info, a cloud-based autonomic system for delivering agriculture
    as a service. They do provide intelligent procedures to diagnose the agriculture
    status automatically using fuzzy logic but they execute so in the cloud, offering
    a mobile interface to see the output. Indeed, this is a good approach as long
    as high connectivity is guaranteed. Moreover, they do not use information from
    the ground; they use expert knowledge taken from their mobile or tablets where
    connectivity is somehow guaranteed. Finally, a survey on the role of IoT in agriculture
    for the implementation of smart farming is provided in [9]. They clearly state
    that IoT-based solutions are at the forefront of automatically maintaining and
    monitoring agricultural farms with minimal human involvement. Indeed, this requires
    the involvement of AI models that can provide predictions in real time. 2.2 Deep
    learning in precision agriculture Deep learning is made up of a set of techniques
    that allow the construction of models with great potential and outstanding results
    [19]. Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been widely applied for
    regression [20]. RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in which
    connections between nodes create a graph directed over a time sequence, allowing
    to have a temporal dynamic behavior. The main difference between RNNs and other
    ANNs architectures is that they use their internal state (memory) to process input
    sequences. RNNs work well in problems with short-term dependencies where the model
    only needs to look at recent (or close) information to carry out the current task
    [12]. However, there are some problems that require less recent or more distant
    information to perform the current task. This is called long-term dependency,
    and RNNs do not work well in such scenarios. The long short-term memory (LSTM)
    is type of RNNs, which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies such as
    those within time series based on learning from previous observations to predict
    the next value in the sequence [18]. While Standard RNNs are based on chain of
    very simple ANNs, such as a single tanh layer, LSTMs are also based on chain of
    ANNs, but the ANNs has a different structure. Deep learning models have drastically
    improved the state of the art in many sectors of industry including agriculture
    [25]. In the field of agriculture, different deep learning techniques (mainly
    convolutional neural networks for image classification and LSTM for the prediction
    of temporal variables) are applied to multiple problems such as plant diseases
    [27], the classification of plant species [13], identification of soil cover and
    classification of crop type [22], estimation of yields [23], identification of
    weeds [3], predictions on climatology [31], just to mention a few recent studies
    within the umbrella of precision agriculture. Focusing on the problem of climatology,
    some works have been published for climatic prediction, showing very good results.
    For instance, Salman et al. [31] propose the construction of a robust statistical
    model to predict meteorological visibility based on other intermediate variables
    (temperature, pressure, humidity and dew point). They use two- and four-layer
    LSTM networks. The data are normalized and rescaled in the range of [0, 1] and
    using a moving average. Here, the multilayered LSTM model was most effective.
    However, this work was not applied to precision agriculture but for forecasting
    visibility based on temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point in airport area
    context. LSTM was also used to predict climate variables in [37]. The targeted
    variables used as an input were temperature, humidity and wind speed. In this
    case, the network architecture consists of two LSTM layers with the activation
    function being the RELU and the optimizer RMSProp. The data were also normalized
    and rescaled in the range of [\(-1\), 1]. The results were generated for a coarse-grained
    prediction in cities. Again, it is not applied to precision agriculture context
    and therefore data were obtained for historical datasets instead of real-time
    information like us. Kratzert et al. [21] proposed a model for rain and runoff
    also using LSTM, which predicts discharge for a variety of watersheds. The authors
    demonstrate the potential of this method by using some variables such as day length,
    rainfall, temperature or humidity. Here, the LSTM is composed of two LSTM layers,
    and between them is a dropout layer to avoid overtraining of the network but in
    the context of water management scheduling not in precision agriculture. Finally,
    we have explored the bibliography of combining deep learning methods with edge
    computing architectures. Chen et al. [7] propose ThriftyEdge, a resource-efficient
    edge computing for intelligent IoT applications, and one of the case studies is
    precision agriculture. However, this work is not tailored to deep learning-based
    applications. Boubin et al. [5] explore fully autonomous precision agriculture
    where fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) map crop fields frequently. They
    develop the full-stack architecture, including a software driven by reinforcement
    learning and ensemble models. The early results presented in this paper do not
    show any relevant results in the field of edge computing. Actually, they work
    at simulation level, running their experiments in a Laptop. Finally, we refer
    the reader to [39] for a review in Edge Intelligence, where efforts for bridging
    the gaps between deep learning and edge computing are summarized. Even though
    the area of precision agriculture is cited as one of the main domains for edge
    intelligence, it is worth highlighting that any work is cited for this domain.
    3 LSTM model for temperature prediction on IoT infrastructures This section introduces
    the proposed LSTM model for the temperature prediction in IoT infrastructures.
    First of all, we briefly introduce the IoT infrastructure to capture information
    from a plot that was previously introduced in [15]. Next, the proposed LSTM model
    for the prediction of temperature is explained in depth. Fig. 1 IoT system architecture
    Full size image 3.1 The IoT infrastructure Figure 1 shows the IoT architecture
    previously presented in [15]. This infrastructure is deployed in two different
    crops at Murcia (South East Spain). The system monitors the hydro-climatological
    information of a plot, and depending on the data and models developed, the system
    can alert farmers to take appropriate action if necessary. The infrastructure
    is based on three main components: (1) hydro-climatological sensors, (2) an intelligent
    data processing system and (3) a monitoring component. The intelligent data processing
    system only performs a preprocessing of outliers values to avoid showing incorrect
    values to the farmer. In this article, we are evaluating the possibility of introducing
    the computation of intelligent algorithm at the edge of the network. Therefore,
    the intelligent data processing system would be physically at the edge or in the
    cloud, depending on the requirements set by the users. The algorithm will allow
    farmers to obtain a temperature prediction in real time at their plots. The workflow
    begins at the sensor level in which the climate data are captured. The sensor
    network is the 4H remote control system of Hidroconta. 2 Figure 2 shows the IoT
    node composed of temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors. They are connected
    to the analog inputs available on the IoT node. In our case, we only use the information
    provided by the temperature sensor. Sensors provide information every 10 min.
    Fig. 2 IoT node (we refer the reader to [15] for insights) Full size image The
    IoT node has connectivity capabilities. For this study, there are three IoT nodes
    where one of them is acting as a gateway to send data to the cloud via GPRS connection.
    The slave nodes are connected to the gateway using LoRa technology. 3 Moreover,
    all of them have a 6 volts (V) and 12 amp (A) battery and a 12V and 5 watts solar
    panel. Finally, each IoT node has a microcontroller with 256 KB of firmware storage
    and 96 KB of volatile memory for data, and it is able to store up to 20.000 records.
    Therefore, the IoT nodes store the information in their internal memory for fault
    tolerance. Fig. 3 Two computing models are presented; a a cloud-based approach
    where the computation is carried out in the backend and b an edge computing approach
    where the computation is carried out in the IoT node Full size image Figure 3
    shows the different computing schemes under evaluation for air temperature prediction
    using LSTM deep learning model. On the one hand, a centralized computing system
    has been used where the IoT nodes have sent the temperature by means of GPRS to
    the centralized module, in which an outliers cleaning has been carried out to
    be able to estimate the temperature using the LSTM. Also, this module allows to
    visualize the data (3a). The second scheme presents the computational component
    within the IoT module. In this way, the LSTM is executed locally, which allows
    temperature prediction without the need to send the information to a centralized
    module. Finally, the prediction is sent by GPRS to a module that allows data to
    be displayed (3b). 3.2 The LSTM model for temperature prediction Analysis of sensor
    data from IoT infrastructures as the one described above can provide valuable
    information for creating new applications to deal with the emergent problems that
    are currently unsolved. We are particularly interested in air temperature modeling
    for early identification of frost on crops. In our previous work, we designed
    a deep learning model, which offered very good results in the prediction of this
    variable. In what follows, we introduce this model and refer the reader to [14]
    for insights. In the Mediterranean area, there is a large diurnal temperature
    variation, which implies that the data time series of air temperature is nonlinear,
    containing sensitive information, making very difficult to predict with traditional
    autoregressive (AR) models such as ARIMA [2]. As previously explained in Sect.
    2, the LSTM is type of RNNs which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies,
    and therefore, it has shown very good results for predicting values in time series.
    LSTM is usually composed of four layers, interacting in several ways, and the
    key idea of LSTMs is the cell state which is basically like a conveyor belt. The
    information runs through the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions.
    The LSTM can add or remove information to the cell state through the Gates. They
    are an optional way to let information pass and are based on a sigmoid neural
    network layer and a point multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer produces
    numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component must pass.
    An LSTM has three of these gates in order to protect and control the cell state.
    Figure 4 shows the interaction of the three gates in detail, as well as how the
    LSTM modules exchanges information with each other. An LSTM module receives the
    temperature at time t as input, which is processed together with the temperature
    prediction at time \(t-1\), received from the previous LSTM module. Both temperatures
    are processed and sent to the next module, which also receives the temperature
    at \(t+1\). As an example, let us assume that the LSTM receives the temperature
    at the instant t, where \(t=3.41\,^\circ \)C. After processing this temperature,
    which is now considered as the previous temperature (\({t-1}\)), it returns as
    output the temperature at the instant \(t+1\), let us assume the temperature \({t+1}\)
    = 3.05 °C, that is, the output of the temperature for the next 10 min interval
    would be 3.05 °C. Fig. 4 LSTM scheme developed to deal with the frost prediction.
    Each LSTM module interacts with the previous and subsequent one. The schema shows
    the three gates that compose each LSTM module, which allow it to remember or delete
    the information that passes through them Full size image The first step in our
    LSTM is to decide the input layer. This is an importance decision as it decides
    what information goes through the cell state. In our case, it is a sigmoid layer,
    which receives as input the air temperature taken from the sensors (see Fig. 3a).
    Moreover, a hidden stacked LSTM layer that is made by LSTM blocks contains four
    interacting layers. These four neuronal layers are made up of three sigmoids and
    a hyperbolic tangent, which have been tested from 50 to 200 neurons. So in each
    step, the LSTM block has to decide what information will be stored in the state
    of the cell. To do this, the two types of neural networks work differently: the
    neural layers with sigmoids decide which values of air temperatures have to be
    updated, while the neuronal layer of the hyperbolic tangent creates a vector of
    new values of candidate air temperatures that could be added to the state. The
    two processes are combined to create a status update. Finally, the output layer
    gives the predicted air temperature based on previous air temperatures. The parameters
    used have been optimized, such as learning factor (0.001), optimizer (Adam), activation
    function (hyperbolic tangent), etc. A more detailed explanation of the parameters
    (batch size, number of epochs, number of delay sequences...) used for the experiments
    is shown in Sect. 4.1.1. 3.3 CPU and GPU implementation Two different implementations
    of the LSTM model previously described have been developed for this article. Both
    of them are based on Keras (version 2.2.4) [16]. Keras is a Python-based open-source
    neural network library, which is capable of running on top of many neural network
    frameworks such as Tensorflow [1] or CNTK [34], just to mention a few. Keras contains
    implementations of commonly used neural networks, including convolutional and
    RNN neural networks. Moreover, it includes the main building blocks such as objectives,
    optimizers, layers, activation functions. Algorithm 1 shows the code baselines
    of our LSTM implementation. First, we create the model as a linear stack of layers
    with the sequential function from Keras. Then, different layers are added to the
    model, depending on an input parameter which is actually defined by the user.
    The influence of this parameter in terms of performance will be studied in Sect.
    4.2. Moreover, the code is able to decide wheather the user wants to build the
    model on GPU through cuDNNLSTM or on CPU through LSTM. cuDNNLSTM is a Keras function
    which offers fast LSTM implementation with CuDNN [8]. It can only be run on Nvidia
    GPU, with the TensorFlow backend. cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives
    for deep neural networks created by Nvidia. It provides GPU counterpart versions
    for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization
    and activation layers. LSTM function is the standard LSTM model defined by Hochreiter
    [18]. Finally, once the model has defined your model, it is compiled with compile
    function. This creates the structures previously defined by the underlying backend
    (in our case TensorFlow 10.11.1) in order to efficiently execute your model during
    training. 4 Results and discussion This section introduces the performance, energy
    and quality evaluation of our LSTM model as applied to predict the air temperature
    of a particular plot in an IoT infrastructure with edge computing capabilities.
    First of all, the experimental environment is described, providing the main metrics,
    hardware and software environment and datasets used in the experiments shown below.
    Then, the execution time and power consumption of the edge computing platform
    and the high-performance server are shown and discussed in detail before the quality
    evaluation of the LSTM to predict air temperature is provided. 4.1 Experimental
    setup 4.1.1 Metrics The performance and energy evaluations are carried out by
    varying the most relevant parameters of the LSTM model, i.e., number of epochs
    and number of neurons. Moreover, this study analyzes the two main stages of this
    model, i.e., training and inference, which are carried out in both an edge computing
    platform (Nvidia Jetson Xavier) and a high-performance computing server. Energy
    of the system is measured by polling once every second the power supply of the
    Jetson architecture with the Watts Up Pro power meter, which provides individual
    energy measurements for the server connected to it, and therefore, energy measurements
    refer to the entire node executing the LSTM model. As for the quality of the results,
    the prediction of temperature is a regression task and the metric measures used
    to assess the quality of the results obtained with the LSTM model are the root
    mean quadratic error, the mean absolute error (MAE), the Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) and determination coefficient (R\(^2\)). The results are positive when the
    RMSE and MAE measurements are less than one degree Celsius and PCC, and the closer
    to one \(R^2\) is, the more acceptable and suitable the model is. For both experiments,
    95% of the data are used to train the model and 5% of the data are used to perform
    the inference task. The optimum parameters used for the experiments are shown
    in Table 1. Parameters that do not influence the computational performance of
    the LSTM have been validated in previous experiments. Table 1 LSTM parameters
    used for the different proposed experiments Full size table 4.1.2 Datasets Table
    2 Each row’s format collected every 10 min. 6 per hour. 144 per day Full size
    table The dataset to evaluate the LSTM model is obtained from the IoT system previously
    described in Sect. 3.1. Table 2 shows an example of the data collected by this
    architecture. The IoT infrastructure generates 144 rows per day (i.e., 1 row each
    10 min), and the data layout is as follows: Date: in dd/mm/aaaa format. Hour:
    in hh:mm format. Air temperature: decimal number in Celsius degrees. Wind speed:
    decimal number in m/s. Relative air humidity: decimal number in %. Our LSTM model
    only works with air temperature, which is collected every 10 min. For the experimental
    environment, four different datasets have been created to test scalability of
    edge and cloud solutions. They include a number of air temperature measurements
    from different periods, including 3,6,12 and 18 months, respectively (see Table
    3). Table 3 Description of the datasets used in the experiments. It shows the
    number of instances, the start and end date period of the air temperature data
    Full size table 4.1.3 Hardware and software environment Experiments have been
    carried out in two different GPU-based platforms: The former is the edge computing
    like architecture Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit. It has four-core ARM v8.0 64-bit
    CPU, 8MB L2 + 4MB L3, 512-core Volta GPU with Tensor Cores and 16GB 256-Bit LPDDR4x
    running at 137GB/sec. The latter is called HETEROLISTIC, and it is composed of
    two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5-2650 at 2.20 GHz, 128 GB of RAM, private L1 and L2
    caches of 32 KB and 256 KB per node, and a L3 cache of 32 MB shared by all the
    cores of a socket. It includes an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti(Pascal), with 12 GB and 3584
    cores (28 SM and 128 SP per SM). The software environment is based on gcc 7.4.0
    and cuda 10 and Python 3.6.5. The design of our LSTM model is based on Tensorflow
    1.10.1 and Keras 2.2.4. 4.2 Evaluation Fig. 5 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image Fig. 6 Energy (in KWh) on AGX Xavier of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image One of the main goals of this paper is to validate
    edge computing for complex tasks such as those under the umbrella of deep learning.
    Computational devices at the edge are traditionally low power and therefore have
    limited computational horsepower. Recently, more powerful edge computing devices
    have emerged, such as those from the Nvidia Jetson family, which include an accelerator
    to speed up parts of the code. Figure 5 shows the performance difference between
    a GPU-based code of our LSTM model compared to multithreaded CPU counterpart version,
    executed in the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier for the training stage and varying the
    number of epochs. Although the GPU architecture included in Xavier only includes
    a multiprocessor with 512 cores, more than 1.6x speedup factor is reported. Moreover,
    Fig. 6 shows the energy in KWh of the two implementations. Xavier’s power consumption
    is higher when the GPU is enabled. Actually, the Xavier consumes 10W when the
    GPU code is running and only 8W when only CPU code does. However, the performance
    difference between these codes makes the GPU code more efficient compared to the
    CPU code in terms of energy consumption. Fig. 7 Execution time (in seconds) of
    LSTM training stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The training is
    carried out with information of 3 and 6 months with 150 neurons Full size image
    Fig. 8 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM inference stage, varying the number
    of epochs for training. The inference is carried out with information of 3 and
    6 months with 150 neurons Full size image Figures 7 and 8 show the execution time
    of the proposed LSTM model to predict the temperature of a plot. Experiments are
    carried with the GPU version of the LSTM model on the edge computing platform
    Jetson AGX Xavier and the high-performance computing server HETEROLISTIC. Two
    performance figures are provided for main stages of the LSTM model, i.e., training
    and inference, and in both scenarios, HETEROLISTIC is defeated by a wide-margin
    Jetson Xavier (peak performance difference of 3.5x speed-up factor). However,
    the magnitude of the execution time for each of these stages is very different.
    Computationally speaking, the training process is more time-consuming than the
    inference process; a difference reaches up to five orders of magnitude, and thus
    different conclusions can be drawn. As previously explained, the LSTM is designed
    to be a part of intelligent component of an IoT infrastructure. The IoT infrastructure
    sends information periodically every 10 min, and therefore, this is time limit
    for making instantaneous predictions. Otherwise, the prediction will become obsolete,
    and the farmer would not be able to take actions before a temperature drops. Therefore,
    the execution time obtained for inference in Xavier is valid for performing instantaneous
    prediction on edge computing. There are scenarios where the deadline to obtain
    the prediction is, at least, 12 h or even more. This is the case of frost prediction
    in places where there is a large diurnal temperature variation as it is the targeted
    region (South East, Spain). Frost prediction is a scenario where the farmer needs
    to know the prediction several hours in advance to activate the antifreeze mechanisms.
    In addition, climate change makes the weather even more unpredictable and changing.
    Therefore, the deep learning models need to be retrained periodically. Execution
    time for the training stage for 3000 epochs and 6-month dataset is less than 12
    h (i.e., 11.01 h) in the case of Jetson Xavier, which is actually the worst of
    the cases presented in Figs. 7 and 8. The execution time is drastically reduced
    when the dataset size and the number of epochs are reduced. For instance, it takes
    less than 6 h to train with 3-month dataset, running 3000 epochs and less than
    1 h if the training is performed with 3-month dataset and 200 epochs. Therefore,
    Jetson Xavier can offer great performance to enable an autonomous decision support
    system for frost prediction, in which both training and inference are performed
    at the edge. Fig. 9 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM training stage, varying
    the number of epochs for training. The training is carried out with information
    of 12 and 18 months Full size image Fig. 10 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    inference stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The inference is carried
    out with information of 12 and 18 months Full size image Figures 9 and 10 show
    large-scale (12- and 18-month datasets) training and inference on both Jetson
    Xavier and HETEROLISTIC. The training execution time grows exponentially along
    with the number of epochs, and inference stays flat. Table 4 Execution time (in
    seconds) of LSTM training and inference stages, varying the number of neurons
    for training and setting the number of epochs to 2500 Full size table Finally,
    Table 4 shows the scalability of the LSTM when the number of neurons increases,
    setting the number of epochs to 2500. The execution time is not affected too much
    by increasing the number of neurons. The usage of GPUs allows high-performance
    data training of the LSTM on both architectures. 4.3 Quality evaluation This section
    shows the results obtained from the LSTM model designed to predict the temperature
    from IoT information. First, we show and analyze the results of the three cross-validations
    and then we show the results of the test of 95% for training and 5% for testing
    (considering 24 consecutive hours). Table 5 Quality results for 3-month, 6-month
    and 12-month datasets varying the number of epochs. RMSE (root-mean-square error),
    MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) and \(R^2\) (determination
    coefficient) Full size table After analyzing the results of the computational
    performance of the models in their training phase and given the high computational
    cost with the 18-month datasets, we have only analyzed the quality of the results
    for the 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets, since the time of 18 months was excessive,
    even the time for the 12-month datasets is considered excessive for an autonomous
    system, but we have considered it necessary to study the quality of the results,
    in case the prediction results were very remarkable. Table 5 shows the error after
    model inference by setting the number of neurons to 150 and varying the number
    of epochs for 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets. The most suitable models are those
    obtained by the 3-month dataset, whose value of \(R^2\) is 99%. For datasets of
    6 and 12 months, the value is also acceptable but it is much better that of the
    3-month dataset. Regarding the error, both RMSE and MAE, there is a remarkable
    fact and it is the increase above a Celsius degree of the 6-month dataset. This
    error increase is due to the fact that the datasets include summer months, which
    causes the model to have noise since the objective is to predict low temperatures.
    As can be seen, this error decreases for the 12-month dataset. Analyzing in depth
    the results, we see how the smallest error and the most adjusted model are produced
    with 3000-epoch configuration. Nevertheless, looking at the difference in time
    in the experiment of computational performance between the configurations of 2500
    and 3000 epochs, we have an hour of difference, being slower the training with
    3000 epochs. Studying the difference of error between 2500 and 3000 epochs with
    the increase of 1 h, we consider more satisfactory considering performance vs.
    quality the result obtained with 2500 epochs. The two best results are highlighted
    in Table 5. Once the quality of the results has been studied after varying the
    number of epochs, Table 6 analyzes the quality of the model by varying the number
    of input neurons to the model between 50 and 200. This is done for 3-, 6- and
    12-month datasets. The behavior obtained is similar to the variation in the number
    of epochs. The 6-month dataset obtains a greater error than the 3-month and 12-month
    datasets. The most suitable model taking into account the determination coefficient
    \(R^2\) is the 3-month dataset with 150 neurons. Already with 200 neurons, the
    model starts with overlearning and the error increases slightly. Table 6 Quality
    results for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month datasets, varying the number of neurons.
    RMSE (root-mean-square error), MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation
    coefficient) and \(R^2\)(determination coefficient) Full size table Therefore,
    in view of the results, we can conclude that the data indicate that it is possible
    to run the prediction model of the LSTM at the edge, since with a training of
    5 h, there is enough time between frost and frost, even if these occur on consecutive
    days. The most optimal configuration found is to train the data with the last
    3 months collected by the node IoT taking as input 150 neurons and making a maximum
    of 2500 epochs. With this configuration, the mean quadratic error obtained is
    less than 0.8 Celsius degrees. 5 Conclusions and future work Prior knowledge of
    low temperatures can help the farmer to anticipate resources and apply frost control
    techniques early enough to ensure maximum efficiency. The overall objective is
    to create an autonomous decision support system for precision agriculture, and
    in such hostile environments, connectivity is limited and there are transient
    clouds that limit the effectiveness of these systems. Edge computing provides
    a framework in which connectivity and security problems are addressed by computing
    at the edge of the network, but today’s edge computing architectures are not able
    to handle heavy workloads. This article evaluates edge computing for frost prediction
    in crops by estimating low temperatures through LSTM deep learning models. LSTM
    deep learning models are computationally heavy workloads, but provide very good
    results for predicting time series. Our results demonstrate that novel edge computing
    platforms including low-power GPUs such as Nvidia Jetson Xavier provide an excellent
    framework for driving edge computing as a real alternative to smart applications.
    Our best LSTM model obtains a deviation less than 1 degree centigrade, being trained
    with information of 3 months, 2500 epochs and 150 neurons, and its execution time
    is less than 5 h which allows training before the prediction is required. As future
    work, new variables will be incorporated into the LSTM to create a multivariate
    LSTM and study the influence of other variables on temperature prediction, as
    well as the network adjustment creating a new architecture with more layers and
    different activation functions and different learning factors. Notes https://www.laverdad.es/murcia/ultimas-heladas-region-20190404113101-nt.html.

    Received 09 Jul 2018 Accepted 30 Oct 2018 Published 18 Nov 2018 Abstract The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet-enabled devices that can sense, communicate,
    and react to changes in their environment. Billions of these computing devices
    are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their
    infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost
    every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life.
    However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns
    to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such,
    privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that
    inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort
    is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors
    to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed
    solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the
    risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns
    in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT
    solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking,
    monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures
    for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform
    layer, and application layer. 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is
    a group of connected physical devices that exchange data about themselves and
    their environments and may take actions on it. The 2017 report of the International
    Data Corporation [ 1] forecasts that 50 billion devices will be connected by 2020
    with a $8.9 trillion market value. Gartner [ 2] published a similar study expecting
    that, in 2020, 50 Billion devices will have their own unique Identifier with a
    $19 trillion market share opportunity. Not only are IoT devices equipped with
    a varying level of computational power (e.g., microcontrollers) but also many
    run a full stack operating system (e.g., Contiki [ 3] and RIOT [ 4]) that enables
    these devices to perform high-level functionality. The main strength of IoT is
    the huge impact it will have on several aspects of the user’s everyday interactions
    and the surrounding environment (e.g., smart spaces). This will improve our quality
    of life in different domains [ 5] as shown in Figure 1 including Energy [ 6],
    Safety, Security, Industry [ 7], Environment, Entertainment, and Healthcare [
    8]. However, IoT devices are intrinsically resource-constrained in terms of computation,
    battery power, intermittent connectivity, and network protocols.    Figure 1  Internet
    of Things applications. These constraints directly impact the choice of technology
    applicable to maintain user privacy. Hence, promoting IoT adoption from the user
    perspective and mitigating potential risks of data misuse and security concerns.
    IoT devices do not commonly implement a standard security scheme [ 3, 4], which
    means there is a huge risk to connect this large number of unsecured devices to
    the Internet [ 9]. Proofpoint Inc. has uncovered the first proven cyberattack
    based on IoT household smart appliances between December 23, 2013, and January
    6, 2014. This attack involved more than 750,000 malicious email communications
    coming from more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets such as home routers,
    smart TVs, and smart refrigerators [ 10]. In 2015, two ethical hackers, Charlie
    Miller and Chris Valasek, gained control of a Jeep Cherokee remotely through vulnerability
    in its onboard entertainment system. According to the hackers, they were able
    to break the Uconnect system that the Chrysler’s line-up of cars and trucks use
    due to open vulnerability. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles could be affected.
    In October 2016, a major DDoS attack took down several giant servers such as Airbnb,
    Reddit, Etsy, Sound Cloud, New York Times, Amazon, Twitter, and Spotify. Though
    it is not clear yet that the blame is on IoT, it is quite likely. IoT devices
    are considered not only a security threat, but also a major privacy concern, as
    these devices collect much personal data such as user identity, location, energy
    consumption, and telephone numbers. This information can reveal a lot about the
    user’s daily life activities (e.g., using washing machines, watching TV, and leaving
    or returning home). The major concern yet is that these devices not only can collect
    users’ private data but also can control their environments. Thus, users are highly
    uncomfortable exposing personal data to public or private servers without a well-established
    trust model [ 11]. Therefore, the lack of well-designed IoT-oriented privacy and
    security techniques will inhibit the user adoption to any IoT technology [ 12].
    The following scenario embodies much of the semantic meaning of user privacy leakage
    and associated risks. Ahmed looks at his smartwatch while doing his usual workout
    and sees that his heart rate is a little high. Once he arrived home, he speaks
    to the smart speaker installed in his room to provide him a list of nearby cardiologists
    to check his heart and blood vessels. Next day after finishing his work, Ahmed
    visited a cardiologist, and he felt relieved when his doctor reassured everything
    is fine. “You just did more exercises than usual and nothing to worry about”,
    the doctor said. The next day, every time Ahmed uses his browser he finds too
    many advertisements related to heart medication, heart monitoring devices, and
    many tutorials about diagnosing a heart attack and how to handle it. Things got
    more serious when he received a phone call from his insurance company for check-up
    survey. “Goodbye privacy”, he whispers to himself as he speaks with the company
    representative. This is only one scenario of too many that shows high privacy
    risks associated with modern technology usage that has become an inevitable part
    of our everyday life. There exist many published surveys on IoT privacy and security
    issues, challenges, and solutions. Ziegeldorf et al. [ 13] analyze the privacy
    issues in IoT. Their focus is on classifying the various privacy threats and pointing
    out the challenges in IoT scenarios. Sadeghi et al. [ 14] introduce the security
    and privacy challenges of industrial IoT systems. They also discuss possible solutions
    towards a complete and secure framework for industrial IoT. Sicari et al. [ 15]
    focus on the main security challenges and the current solutions. They categorize
    the issues into authentication, access control, confidentiality, privacy, trust,
    secure middleware, mobile security, and policy enforcement. Suo et al. [ 16] review
    the security and privacy in IoT, where they analyze the security architecture
    and features. They also discuss ongoing research status and the challenges of
    secure technologies including encryption mechanism, communication security, protecting
    sensor data, and cryptographic algorithms to support privacy preservation in IoT.
    Although security and privacy are highly correlated, this paper primarily focuses
    on privacy challenges and discusses a broad range of privacy-related aspects in
    open IoT environments to provide better insights on the design principles and
    development of privacy preserving IoT environments. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the unique characteristics of IoT
    posing significant challenges on resource-constrained IoT devices. We also discuss
    the notion of privacy in IoT by pointing out some scenarios related to privacy
    concerns. Section 3 describes major IoT privacy issues and concerns such as identification,
    tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Then, we discuss existing IoT privacy solutions
    in Section 5. Section 6 provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy issues and
    mechanisms at the different layers of the IoT stack, namely, Device Layer, Platform
    Layer, and application layer, respectively. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper
    and provides closing notes. 2. Privacy in the Internet of Things IoT provides
    consumers with a high degree of automation and control on how to carry out everyday
    tasks through saturating the environment with smart things. IoT smart things refer
    to a broad spectrum of nonstandard computing devices including microcontrollers,
    sensors, and actuators that can transmit and exchange data to enable smarter interactions
    and support informed decision making. Things are embedded in consumers'' devices
    and industrial machinery to collect and exchange data about the surroundings.
    Things can also cause physical changes to their environments and can be controlled
    directly from proximity or remotely via Internet. Although privacy concerns discussed
    in this paper are generally valid for any IoT deployments, we provide examples
    related to consumers'' connected devices such as smart appliances to make the
    point clear. In addition, the pace at which consumers'' smart devices are developed
    is much higher than the development of safeguard techniques that can protect these
    devices and their data collection from growing privacy threats. Given the high
    penetration of IoT devices and their impact on our everyday life, we need to fully
    understand the risks and challenges such devices pose on our privacy. More importantly,
    we need to answer the following question: Is it possible to support privacy preserving
    and safe environment for IoT users such those offered in traditional Internet?
    To precisely answer this question, we need first to discriminate between relevant
    terminologies such as privacy, trust, and security. Privacy means that information
    about individuals must be protected and should not be exposed without explicit
    consent under any circumstances. Every individual has the ultimate right to decide
    with whom to share their data. For example, in our previous scenario, Ahmed should
    be the only one to decide whether to share his heart conditions with the insurance
    company or not. Trust is defined as the product of attack probability and the
    damage it can cause. Trust is derived from two crucial terms: transparency and
    consistency. Transparency means that IoT devices collecting information inform
    the user about what data is collected, the purpose of collection, and how the
    collected data will be used. Consistency means that the behaviour of IoT devices
    consistently meets user expectation. For example, if a user asks his smart speaker
    to control the room light, it must do nothing unintended, but the specific requested
    task. Security refers to the protection of devices and connection from unauthorized
    access. Based on the aforementioned definitions, it is evident that privacy is
    more general than both security and trust. For instance, an IoT service could
    gain user trust and provide proper security but still violates the user’s privacy
    by exposing personal data without clear and explicit permissions. 2.1. Impact
    of Device Limitations on Privacy IoT smart things are typically resource-constrained
    with limited capabilities due to size and weight (e.g., memory, processing, and
    battery power) and network connectivity (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4). For example, IEEE
    802.15.4 specification is constrained with respect to (1) low data rates, which
    range from 20 Kbits/s (868 MHz) to 250 Kbits/s (2.45 GHz), (2) unreliable and
    lossy links compared to wired links, (3) small packet size (127 bytes), which
    means less room for payload when including other headers, and (4) aggressive power
    cycle, by which IoT smart things aim to save power by staying longer in low-power
    mode. Such constraints directly impact the type and complexity of functionality
    that IoT devices can run. Recently, significant efforts have been made towards
    standardizing the IoT protocol stack [ 17]. For example, to enable low-power connectivity
    among smart objects in IoT systems, the IEEE 802.15.4–2006 low-power physical
    (PHY) layer and the IEEE 802.15.4e link layer based on Time Synchronized Channel
    Hopping (TSCH) have been developed in 2006 [ 18]. Several scholars pointed out
    the technical challenges that face IoT environments due to various resource constraints.
    Yu et al. [ 19] consider IoT devices as weak access points to vital infrastructures
    (e.g., a medical or military facility) and can be misused to leak sensitive data.
    The authors have made two main observations regarding IoT systems: (1) network-based
    approaches are less vulnerable than host-based approaches due to inherent limitations
    and possible unpatched vulnerabilities on IoT devices; (2) traditional static
    perimeter defenses are unable to secure IoT devices, since these devices are deployed
    deep inside the network, with their physical and computational context constantly
    changing. Therefore, resource limitations make it challenging to secure IoT layers
    individually. Table 1 lists the top countries, in Sept 2017, with IoT devices
    (237,539 devices) vulnerable to Heartbleed [ 20] according to SHODAN [ 21] and
    other sources. Table 1  List of top countries with vulnerable IoT devices. 2.2.
    Impact of Complex Heterogeneity on IoT Privacy IoT has intrinsic complexity, since
    multiple diverse objects located in different contexts can exchange information
    among each other. This complicates the design and deployment of efficient, interoperable,
    and scalable mechanisms to preserve users’ privacy. Heterogeneity also has significant
    influence on the design of IoT protocols. Recourse-constrained devices will interact
    with one another/infrastructure (e.g., web servers and cloudlets) either directly
    or through gateways. In this case, it is essential to implement or create lightweight
    security protocols that support an end-to-end secure communication channel. These
    protocols require implementing distributing management system to distribute credentials
    and facilitate keys session establishment between peers. The data flooding caused
    by billions of IoT devices is a big threat, in a way that hurts and violates the
    user’s privacy. One of the main violations of the large volume of data exchange
    is linking this data to a certain user. So, the user’s anonymity is another dimension
    that must be taken into consideration to support privacy in connected environments.
    Further, creating mechanisms to provide data summarization and access policies
    related to private data will enable transparency and avoid IoT silently taking
    control of our lives. There exist several surveys focusing on the impact of IoT
    heterogeneity on users’ privacy. Heer, T. et al. [ 22] provide a number of requirements
    to secure IoT environments and preserve user privacy through overcoming specific
    technical limitations including (1) complex heterogeneity of IoT systems, which
    complicates protocol design and system operation; (2) scarce CPU and memory resources,
    which limit the use of resource-demanding cryptoprimitives, such as public-key
    cryptography as used in most Internet security standards; and (3) end-to-end security
    measures that are IoT-oriented, since traditional Internet-based approaches are
    typically inapplicable due to resource limitations. The lessons we learned so
    far suggests that resource limitations are a major inhibitor to the adoption of
    traditional techniques as is. IoT architectures must implement privacy by design
    from the ground up [ 23], to provide users with central control over their security
    and privacy. 3. Motivating Scenarios The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead
    to huge security breaks and threaten user privacy by exposing vital personal information.
    In this section, we provide some scenarios of IoT applications where personal
    data can be breached. 3.1. Smart Home Utility Monitoring According to a recent
    report published by US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2017 [ 24],
    64.7 million smart meters have been installed in electric utilities in 2015. Around
    88% of these installations were residential upgrades as shown in Table 2. These
    smart meters measure and log electricity usage at a minimum of 1-hour intervals
    but can report readings in real-time at a much higher sampling rate. This data
    is collected by utility companies at least once a day. Smart meters range from
    basic hourly interval meters to real-time meters equipped with two-way communication
    that is capable of recording and transmitting instantaneous data. Natural gas
    meters and water meters are also on the rise and likely count to similar numbers.
    However, EIA does not publish their data publicly. The extensive deployment of
    smart meters has serious privacy implications since they unintentionally leak
    detailed information about residents’ activities. Processing and analyzing this
    information can lead to serious privacy leakage such as profiling the behaviour
    of the residents. Furthermore, with existing sophisticated analytics such data
    may reveal when residents are home and what may be their heath conditions (e.g.,
    toilet flushing rate may indicate that the resident has diarrhoea). This does
    not stop at breaking the user privacy but may very much lead to life-threating
    situations. Table 2  Number of AMI installations by sector, 2015. Molina-Markham
    et al. [ 25] raise awareness around privacy issues related to the use of smart
    meters. They show that even without knowing any information about household activities,
    applying off-the-shelf statistical methods can easily extract complex usage patterns
    from smart meter data. Their work is based on data collected over a 2-month period
    from three homes. The data contains household power consumption aggregated at
    1-second rate. Even with this small-scale deployment, the authors managed to demonstrate
    the latent for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of personal information,
    such as how many people are in the house, sleeping routines, and eating routines.
    The proposed privacy-enhancing smart meter is based on 3 components: household
    smart meters, neighbourhood gateways, and a remote utility server. The server
    applies Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols [ 26] that allow a prover (smart meter)
    to demonstrate the knowledge of a secret (collected data) to a verifier (gateway/server),
    without revealing any information that help the verifier to infer the secret.
    This enables utility companies to accomplish their goals without compromising
    the customer’s privacy. Apthorpe et al. [ 27] discuss the same concern. However,
    they point out that an Internet Service provider (ISP) or other network observers
    can gather private and sensitive information about home activities by analyzing
    Internet traffic from smart homes containing IoT devices even if the devices use
    secure encryption. Several strategies have been investigated to avoid the privacy
    risks associated with smart home traffic monitoring such as traffic blocking,
    tunnelling, and rate-shaping. However, the user cannot block outgoing traffic
    from their home; otherwise their devices will be unusable. While traffic tunnelling
    via a VPN is more secure, it does not totally guarantee privacy preserving. Authors
    propose the use of traffic shaping using Independent Link Padding (ILP) to prevent
    the leak of rate information and thus render attacks impossible. 3.2. Crowdsourcing
    and Public Monitoring Crowdsourcing is the use of collective knowledge of a large
    crowd to help solving a specific problem. Crowdsourcing benefits from high penetration
    of smartphones, which becomes the common mobile platform for users worldwide.
    Developers and average users with limited programming experience can create feature-rich/personalized
    applications by simply requesting access to private information such as location,
    contact lists, media files, etc. However, this model raises serious privacy concerns
    with no trust mechanisms that govern how applications access and handle such private
    information. It is also technically possible that applications may gain unauthorized
    access to the device’s camera, networks, and system settings. Mobile Crowdsourcing
    Networks (MCN) include four basic types of entities as depicted in Figure 2: (i)
    The service provider is a crowdsourcing platform that offers crowdsourcing services
    to both end users and public crowds. (ii) End users are the clients who purchase
    or rent crowdsourcing services at a certain cost. (iii) Sensing crowd is a crowd
    of mobile users who accept and participate in crowdsourced sensing tasks. (iv)
    Computing crowd is a crowd of users who accept and participate in crowdsourced
    computing tasks (sensing-based computing tasks, or pure computing tasks).    Figure
    2  General architecture of mobile crowdsourcing networks (reproduced from [ 28]).
    Yang et al. [ 28] point out that the privacy may be leaked out from either data
    or tasks. Privacy threats resulting from data leakage can be divided into three
    categories. (1) privacy of sensed data contains personal information about participants,
    such as identities, location information, and biometric information. For example,
    the location information can be easily obtained either from GPS receivers embedded
    in mobile devices or triangulation-based approaches on Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
    Moreover, environmental context such as ambient temperature, light, noise level
    may also reveal the location information. The disclosure of the location information
    may leak the privacy of participants, such as home and workplace locations, routines,
    and habits. (2) Privacy of crowdsourced data may contain sensitive information,
    such as business and financial records, proprietary research data, or personal
    health information. (3) Privacy of crowdsourcing results can be analyzed to infer
    sensitive information not authorized/known by the service provider. 4. Evaluation
    of Privacy Threats in IoT IoT increasingly evolve with new emerging technologies
    and services. In this section, we discuss the various privacy threats and challenges
    associated with IoT environments. We provide a solid definition and a concrete
    example of privacy violation for each threat. Then, we discuss the impact of IoT
    evolution on this threat. Lastly, we point out the main challenges associated
    with these threats as well as any correlation when exists. 4.1. User Identification
    From privacy perspectives, user identification is the ability to distinguish a
    person (or an entity) or revealing their identity based on a piece of acquired
    data (e.g., name, address, or personal information). The risk of such a threat
    is that privacy-violating actions could be carried out after the customer is identified.
    This threat enables and aggravates other threats, e.g., profiling and tracking
    of individuals’ behaviour. It also allows for linking information from different
    sources for the same identified target. Analyzing this information can easily
    result in exposing the target’s life pattern. For example, developers that have
    access to user traces can utilize machine learning techniques to infer personal
    information about users’ interests, which can be exploited to flood user interfaces
    with ad-ware and targeted advertisements. The wide adoption of IoT facilitates
    the collection of a huge amount of data using IoT devices that can be stored and
    analyzed beyond the user’s control domain. Thus, user identification becomes the
    dominant threat regarding user’s privacy. Further, with the increasing number
    of IoT deployments, the user identification threat and associated risks will significantly
    scale up. Different IoT technologies bring their own benefits and challenges.
    Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) is commonly used in IoT scenarios to recognize/identify
    things, record metadata, and control distinct targets through radio waves [ 29].
    The basic RFID system architecture contains tags and readers [ 30]. Tags are associated
    with objects for identification and readers read these tags using a close proximity
    communication technology. When connected to the Internet, RFID remote readers
    can automatically recognize, track, and monitor any object with a global tag,
    and in real time if needed [ 31]. Pateriya et al. [ 32] point out that vulnerable
    tags are subject to spying, spoofing, traffic analysis, and denial of service
    attacks. Unauthorized reader can access these vulnerable tags without proper access
    privileges. Although the tag information could potentially be protected using
    lightweight security mechanisms, tracking is easy to accomplish through tag replies.
    User identification is currently implemented in almost all mobile platforms, using
    a variety of mechanisms including face recognition, fingerprints, and/or voice
    recognition. Surveillance systems also implement face and voice recognition using
    embedded cameras and microphones, respectively. An unauthorized attacker could
    gain full access to a surveillance camera and tamper its firmware to send the
    data to the legitimate server and copy the attacker. Identifying customers by
    authorized controllers also remains a privacy threat that leads to other threats
    such as profiling and utility monitoring. Surveillance cameras deployed in public
    settings (e.g., for video analytics and customer profiling [ 33, 34]) utilize
    public facial databases (e.g., MIT-CBCL Face Recognition Database) to track users.
    Such systems have become available to the public use for free like marketing platforms
    [ 35]. User identification through facial recognition has indeed become an inevitable
    reality and significantly hurts user privacy. 4.2. User Tracking User tracking
    is primarily based on user identification, and it becomes a threat when the data
    collected about a certain user is maintained and used to track this user’s behaviour.
    The most famous type of user tracking is based on location. When a user is identified,
    binding the location history enables tracking. Location-based services require
    that users share their location information. Thus, user location can be tracked
    without users’ explicit consent and likely without their knowledge. Several technologies
    significantly affect user tracking such as positioning techniques, which has made
    great developments in recent years. Positioning techniques are typically based
    on Global Positioning Systems (GPS), GSM, RFID, and the Wireless LAN [ 36, 37].
    The work done in [ 38] shows that average Facebook users significantly underestimate
    the amount of data to which they allow third-party applications access. The evolution
    of such technologies provides service providers with a tool to learn about personal
    patterns (e.g., home location, work location, and visited places), which raises
    the concern of location privacy intrusion. Since the IoT market is open, user
    location information can be abused or sold to third parties for targeted advertisements
    purposes. More seriously, criminals could exploit such data to perform various
    types of criminal activities that risk individual’s life. For example, the use
    of GPS to stalk customers [ 39– 41] and, generally, the uncomfortable feeling
    of being observed are discussed in [ 42]. Even when fake identity is used, the
    system cannot overcome such a privacy threat with location-based services enabled
    [ 43]. 4.3. Profiling Profiling [ 44] refers to recording and analyzing data to
    characterize personal behaviour to assess or infer their personal interests in
    a certain domain or for discrimination purposes. Off-the-shelf data mining tools
    can draw a clear picture of the customer needs and easily provide a detailed customer
    profile. Following the rule “know your customer” [ 45, 46], in e-commerce, online
    profiling is a key tool for companies to better understand their customer needs.
    Profiling data is increasingly used for target advertisements, Web sites personalization,
    and service matching. However, profiling leads to privacy violation when used
    to learn a customer''s political and religious views, sexual orientation, and/or
    medical conditions [ 47– 49], valuable information that can be shared and sold
    without further consent [ 50– 54]. The rising of Internet-connected systems and
    the evolution of data mining algorithms and tools significantly contributed to
    the emergence of big data [ 55]. From IoT and big data perspectives, the argument
    is that limiting access to private/personal data negatively impacts the accuracy
    of the data mining exercise. Besides this conflict of interest between privacy
    and profiling, we noticed that identification and tracking threats further aggravate
    the possibilities for profiling and increase the risks of privacy leakage by data
    hunting black markets. 4.4. Utility Monitoring and Controlling This threat is
    directly relevant to gathering data related to customers’ utility usage. Such
    data could be used to infer user’s daily life patterns. This sensitive information
    represents major privacy threat if acquired through an unauthorized access. However,
    it becomes more serious when attackers gain privileged access to control utility
    usage without the user’s explicit permission or knowledge. Gubbi et al. [ 56]
    categorize IoT applications into four domains: (1) Personal and Home, (2) Enterprise,
    (3) Utilities, and (4) Mobile. In personal and home applications, Wi-Fi is typically
    used to provide high bandwidth for video streaming services and support high sampling
    rates for audio streaming as well as control of home appliances such as air conditioners,
    refrigerators, and washing machines. In Enterprise applications, IoT devices collect
    data from workplace environment. For example, environmental monitoring applications
    keep track of the number of occupants and manages the utilities within the building
    (e.g., HVAC, lighting). If attackers gain access to these devices, they can cause
    financial and personal harm to owners. Although utility companies claim that they
    collect data to optimize their service, the granularity at which such data is
    collected raise concerns. Fine granularity data may reveal private information
    that users do not want to share. For example, collecting water usage at high sampling
    rate can reveal whether customers are home or not. Data analytics tools also can
    show when customers take showers or use the bathroom. All these are private information
    that users would not feel comfortable sharing with others. For example, smart
    grid and smart metering [ 57], image processing, computer vision to support video
    based IoT [ 58], and irrigation monitoring in the agricultural industries [ 59].
    It is highly challenging to control the disclosure of all this information from
    these different applications. It is also readily viable that companies could store
    customers’ data and retain it indefinitely due to increasingly advancing storage
    technology with continuously decreasing prices. The increasing evolution and adoption
    of IoT continue to aggravate user privacy and present new challenges on supporting
    infrastructure to provide more robust privacy preserving techniques. Users need
    to be aware of entities collecting their private data, understand how this data
    is shared outside their control domain, evaluate the purpose of access, estimate
    potential data misuse, and assess associated risks and consequences. Such requirements
    pose additional challenges on IoT infrastructures to provide users with safe and
    privacy preserving environments. Parker Higgins [ 60] tweeted about the unsettling
    similarity of the Samsung Smart TV privacy policy, which warned consumers not
    to discuss sensitive topics near the device [ 61]. This incident led Samsung to
    edit its privacy policy and clarify the Smart TV’s data collection practices [
    62]. With IoT becoming an important part of everyday life, people must pay extra
    attention to their privacy and systems must implement ethical practices in dealing
    with private data. Users should always be aware of the exact purpose of data collection
    and understand the spectrum of potential misuse. There must be also continuous
    enforcing mechanisms for access policies. The control should ultimately be placed
    at the users’ hands to make informed decisions on how their private data is collected
    and shared beyond their control domain. 5. Classifications of IoT Privacy Solutions
    Privacy issues in traditional Internet mostly impact connected users surfing the
    Internet. However, in IoT scenarios, privacy concerns may affect people who are
    not even using any IoT service but happen to be present in the environment. In
    traditional Internet services, the W3C group has defined the Platform for Privacy
    Preferences (P3P) [ 63], which provides a standard language for the description
    of privacy preferences and policies. P3P allows for automatic negotiation of the
    privacy concerning parameters based on data needed to run the service and the
    privacy requirements set by the user. Internet applications can implement well-established
    authentication procedures to capture the data flow and determine whether there
    are any potential privacy violations and immediately notify the user. However,
    in IoT settings it is far complex to precisely capture privacy violations due
    to the lack of well-defined control domain boundaries. Therefore, IoT environments
    must respect the privacy of individuals and ensure that collected personal data
    must be used for absolutely nothing, but the intended purpose. Lastly, collected
    data must be stored only until it is strictly needed. This section discusses the
    proposed solutions, summarized in Table 3, to overcome privacy challenges and
    related security issues as follows. (i) Authentication and authorization (ii)
    Edge computing and plug-in architectures (iii) Data anonymization (iv) Digital
    forgetting and data summarization Table 3  Summary of privacy preserving proposed
    solutions in IoT environments. 5.1. Authentication and Authorization Authentication
    in IoT scenarios is challenging due to the limitations of IoT devices. However,
    many researchers have proposed lightweight solutions to address these limitations
    and support authentication in constrained environments. Lee et al. [ 64] proposed
    simple and secure key establishment to be used in IoT networks. The authors introduce
    an encryption method based on XOR operations to implement a lightweight cryptography
    protocol. The hardware implementation of this protocol is demonstrated and can
    be used to establish the mutual authentication procedure in a typical RFID system
    for IoT applications. Porambage et al. [ 65] propose PAuth Key protocol, an authentication
    scheme and keying mechanism suitable for resource-constrained WSNs (a.k.a. IoT),
    irrespective of their vendor or form factor. PAuth provides application-level
    end-to-end security through two phases: registration and authentication. In the
    registration phase, end users and edge devices obtain their cryptographic credentials.
    The authentication phase establishes key-based authentication using mutual communication.
    The protocol allows end users to authenticate with the sensing nodes directly
    and acquire sensor data and services. The protocol supports distributed IoT applications
    since the certificates are lightweight and can be handled by resource-constrained
    devices. Sharaf-Dabbagh et al. [ 66] propose a new authentication framework for
    IoT environments based on device fingerprinting techniques. According to their
    model, each IoT device has a unique fingerprint, which can be used to communicate
    with the cloud infrastructure. The model provides authentication of IoT devices
    through a twofold approach: (1) a generative model to verify that the received
    messages belong to a certain object; (2) validation of the sender legitimacy to
    ensure that it is not a malicious object. The authors adopted the infinite Gaussian
    mixture model (IGMM) as a generative model if the object fingerprint follows a
    multivariate Gaussian distribution. The second validation method is implemented
    using Bhattacharyya distance to compare the clustering results from IGMM with
    the expected cluster shape for the device. Then, the proposed framework uses transfer
    learning techniques to effectively detect emulation attacks, thus, differentiating
    between fingerprint abnormalities resulting from environments versus attacks.
    Bouij-Pasquier et al. [ 67] propose SmartOrBAC, a context-aware authorization
    model that accommodates IoT network requirements. SmartOrBAC leverages real-time
    context to make informed authorization decisions. The authors separate functionality
    into multiple layers and resource-constrained devices collaborate to perform tasks
    using distributed processing. Salman et al. [ 68] propose an authentication scheme
    for heterogeneous IoT environments based on Software Defined Network (SDN). SDN
    controllers are used to manage security parameters by implementing a trusted certificate
    authority. All SDN controllers rely on a central SDN controller that translates
    different technology-specific identities into a single shared identity scheme
    based on virtual IPv6 addresses. This shared identity is then used to authenticate
    devices and gateways. The SDN controller authenticates gateways and gateways authenticate
    their associated devices. The proposed scheme is performed in three steps: (1)
    the gateway obtains an authentication certificate from a controller, (2) things
    register with the gateway, and (3) IoT devices send authentication requests to
    the gateway. Their analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme
    is secure against replay attack, masquerade attack, and man-in-the-middle attack.
    5.2. Edge Computing and Plug-In Architectures There is a growing adoption of the
    edge computing paradigm [ 91] in the last few years. In edge computing data processing
    and storage occur partially at the network edge, rather than completely in the
    backed. Due to the increasing trend of generating data at the edge of the network,
    it makes more sense to leverage edge computing to resolve concerns such as latency,
    device limitations, security, and more importantly user privacy [ 92]. Davies
    et al. [ 69] discuss the concern of data privacy in IoT networks, following Geoffrey
    Moore’s warning [ 93] about the discontinuity awaiting every new technology. The
    authors introduce a plug-in mediator solution to overcome the privacy concerns
    stemming from overcentralization of IoT systems. The proposed architecture suggests
    deploying privacy mediators (i.e., trusted software modules) into the data distribution
    pipeline. A mediator runs on a cloudlet [ 94] to enforce the privacy policy specified
    by sensor/user. While developers can provide sensor drivers that convert data
    into common formats, customers can create privacy policies that control the mediator
    configuration and the sensor data routing to/from that mediator. This architecture
    enables the implementation of various types of data privacy controls such as deletion,
    denaturing, summarization, inference, anonymization, and mobility. Langheinrich
    [ 70] presents a privacy-aware system (pawS) to overcome the privacy concerns
    by guaranteeing that collected data remains private. It provides data collection
    and processing tools that notify users of what exactly is collected. Thus, the
    user decides what actions can be taken. The proposed architecture adopts privacy
    preserving principles in ubiquitous computing [ 71]. The architecture encompasses
    four components: (1) machine-readable privacy policies to provide choice and consent,
    (2) policy announcement mechanisms to give notice, (3) privacy proxies to support
    access control, and (4) policy-based data access for protected recourses. However,
    proximity, negotiation, and locality are not implemented in this system. This
    architecture presents to customers all available options upfront to choose from,
    rather than forcing them to negotiate with an automated process to get the best
    deal. Bagüés et al. [ 72] introduce a privacy preserving framework for smart homes
    (Sentry@HOME). The framework adopts a user-centric approach to control the dissemination
    of private data according to the privacy policies defined by the user. It consists
    of five essential components: Sentry Registry (SR), Sentry Implementation (SI),
    Context Handler (CH), Sentry Manager Interface (SMI), and the Noise Module (NM).
    The framework embeds privacy enforcements into existing smart home infrastructure.
    The authors demonstrate that the smart home is a safe harbour for privacy-sensitive
    data and that their framework acts as a guardian sentry. Seong et al. [ 73] present
    a decentralized architecture of PrPl, which proposes Personal-Cloud Butlers as
    a safe harbour for personal data indexing. A butler is configured for each user
    to provide fine-grain access control and storage. A similar work is presented
    in [ 74] that investigates on-device sensor abstractions for augmented reality
    applications to prevent private data from accidental leakage from applications
    having privileged access to raw sensor data. 5.3. Data Anonymization Data anonymization
    is the process of removing identifiable information that may lead to personal
    identification so that people/objects described by such data remain anonymous
    [ 75]. The purpose of data anonymization is generally to protect user privacy.
    Several attempts have been made to provide anonymization, image blurring, and
    denaturing mechanisms for IoT applications [ 77, 78], especially for images and
    videos. Denaturing is the process of using image processing techniques to blur
    or alter a specific part of the image to preserve personal privacy. Data anonymization
    not only protects user privacy but also enables service providers to use collected
    data to customize the services for users. Data anonymization has three main objectives
    [ 76]: protecting the privacy of involved users, hiding any information about
    the network internal structure, and maintaining the anonymized traffic traces
    as realistic as possible to the nonanonymized packet stream. Sliwa [ 79] presents
    a new framework for anonymized data exchange that integrates user privacy, system
    safety, and quality of service. The main challenge is how to design a data broker
    that takes only general knowledge about the required data communication and possibly
    unaware of the semantics, yet assures reliable and secure data exchange between
    partners. The author also points out the challenges of developing data separation
    algorithms that allow for certain flexibility to service providers, yet respect
    the predefined access rules (personal identity, granularity). Berrehili and Belmekki
    [ 80] present a deep risk analysis for IoT privacy threats. The authors propose
    several technical and nontechnical approaches to protect user privacy in IoT scenarios.
    They provide a recommendation for IoT app developers to inform users about potential
    privacy violations resulting from private data disclosure. The authors also propose
    that IoT devices implement an authentication algorithm to verify the source of
    updated files using a cryptographic mechanism. They also suggest using anonymization
    techniques to mask the personal information in the data before sharing. Shinzaki
    et al. [ 81] extend the identification-based key sharing scheme to TLS to implement
    mutual authentication, encrypt data communication, and provide anonymization technology
    for the safe disclosure of data using multiple layers of meshes on a map for the
    utilization of positional data. Similarly, Otgonbayar et al. [ 82] present a new
    anonymization algorithm based on the k−anonymity privacy model. The proposed algorithm
    uses the time-based sliding window technique to manipulate IoT streams by partitioning
    the stream tuples based on their description. Wang et al. [ 83] introduce a scalable
    privacy-aware IoT architecture that enables live video analytics across many cameras
    by combining OpenFace [ 95], a high accuracy open-source face recognizer, with
    face tracking to maintain high accuracy and achieve full frame rate speeds. Authors
    also use privacy mediators to enforce user-defined privacy policies (e.g., face
    denaturing), yet the system maintains the original videos for possible future
    needs (e.g., finding an evidence from a crime scene). Addo et al. [ 84] present
    a reference framework for protecting end user’s privacy throughout the emotion
    analytics lifecycle. They propose Affect-Driven Personalization Lifecycle (ADPL),
    a model to learn the privacy preferences of end users through implementing a set
    of privacy rules: personalized anonymity, secure multiparty privacy preservation,
    encrypted data provenance, image-melding and reshaping techniques, and result
    aggregation. 5.4. Digital Forgetting and Data Summarization Digital forgetting
    is the process of provably deleting all copies of a dataset [ 96], while data
    summarization provides a high-level data abstraction to hide details or reduce
    granularity. Digital forgetting and data summarization are important concepts
    to relieve people’s anxiety around data collection. Users would feel more comfortable
    sharing their data knowing that collected data will be wiped out once the purpose
    of collection is void [ 85]. Data summarization is classified into the following:
    (i) Temporal summarization: in which collected data is a function of time (e.g.,
    gather sensor reading per day rather than per minute) (ii) Spatial summarization:
    in which collected data is a function of location (e.g., releasing location data
    at the zip code level rather than raw GPS readings) As the cost of storage decreases,
    the ability to store a large amount of data at low cost dramatically increases.
    This makes it easy for entities collecting data to store it for longer time. Hence,
    the need for creating efficient mechanisms that periodically delete information
    that is no longer needed for which it was generated arises. Therefore, IoT environments
    must take into consideration applying either data forgetting or summarization
    to protect user privacy. A few experimental solutions have been recently developed
    that allow users to share private data over the Internet with assurance that such
    data will be entirely deleted after a certain period of time (e.g., drop.io and
    the Guest Pass features on Flickr [ 97]). However, porting such solutions to IoT
    environments is not straightforward. Therefore, several data forgetting techniques
    have been proposed using classical cryptography [ 86]. Most of these techniques
    assume that encrypted data is deleted when the required decryption key is deleted.
    Several other techniques have been developed based on distributed data storage
    so that data is deleted due to unavoidable social and technical processes [ 87].
    Despite digital forgetting is an effective tool to preserve user privacy, it becomes
    challenging when the data size grows very large due to processing and analytics
    overhead [ 98]. Therefore, efficient data analytics techniques are required to
    reduce such overhead and optimize the process. To address this problem, Baraniuk
    [ 88] proposes to enforce IoT devices to acquire only important data instead of
    everything. Also, effective knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining
    techniques [ 89, 90] are effective solutions to summarize data collected by IoT
    devices, which can enhance the overall system performance and improve quality
    of service yet preserve user privacy. These methods are essential in IoT scenarios,
    in which large amounts of collected data can seriously impact the privacy of individuals
    and compromise the security of economic entities and government institutions.
    6. Privacy Preserving IoT Environments Applying existing Internet standards to
    smart devices can simplify the integration of the envisioned scenarios in the
    IoT contexts. However, the security mechanisms in conventional Internet protocols
    need to be modified or extended to preserve user privacy in IoT applications.
    In this section, we discuss privacy preserving at different layers of the IoT
    stack. We build our discussions based on a three-layer IoT stack as shown in Figure
    3.    Figure 3  IoT three-layered architecture. 6.1. Privacy Preservation in IoT
    Device Layer The IoT device layer (also known as perception layer) contains all
    physical resources that collect/control data (sensors and actuators). However,
    these resources are highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained. Such constraints
    pose unique challenges on applying privacy preserving techniques. Thus, IoT devices
    are subject to several attacks discussed in [ 99] including node capture, fake
    node, malicious data, denial of service attack (DoS), timing attack, routing threats,
    replay attack, side channel attack (SCA), and mass node authentication problem.
    Therefore, several security measures must be considered when designing this layer
    as follows: (i) Access control and authentication: to prevent user privacy leaks
    from open and unauthorized access. Juels et al. [ 100] present a good solution
    to implement Selective RFID Jamming as an access control scheme on low-cost tags
    (ii) Data encryption: to secure data exchange and guarantee safe delivery. Wang
    [ 101] presents a nonlinear key algorithm based on displaced calculation to provide
    data encryption. This key algorithm requires low computational power to provide
    high security and good data transmission rate (iii) Secure channel using IPSec:
    the IPSec protocol [ 102] offers both authentication and encryption. Raza et al.
    [ 103] present a 6LoWPAN/IPsec extension to provide security for IoT devices.
    The authors demonstrate that IPSec outperforms the standard IEEE 802.15.4 link
    layer security in IoT environments (iv) Cryptography technology: to offer privacy
    protection, confidentiality, authenticity and data integrity. Secure communication
    protocols include digital signatures and hash values are used to ensure data integrity
    6.2. Privacy Preservation in Platform/Infrastructure Layer The platform layer
    represents the classical network layer in the OSI model [ 104]. This layer integrates
    intelligent data preprocessing to reduce resource requirements at the application
    layer. The network layer poses some general security problems related to data
    integrity and confidentiality such as unauthorized access to networks, eavesdropping,
    confidentiality and integrity damage, DDoS attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Although existing network protocols implement highly secured measures, they are
    not robust enough for M2M communications in resource-constrained environments.
    As such, existing security mechanisms are weak/inapplicable on IoT devices and
    may lead to creating barriers rather than connections between different machines.
    Therefore, the heterogeneity of these networks makes security, interoperability,
    and coordination of networks becoming worse, leading to security vulnerabilities.
    New IoT-oriented security mechanisms must be designed from the ground up to fit
    IoT environments, taking into consideration the following security measures: (i)
    Set up an end-to-end authentication and key agreement mechanism, PKI (Public-Key
    Infrastructure), WPKI for wireless, Security routing, IDS, etc. (ii) Utilize network
    virtualization to reduce the network management complexity and the likelihood
    of improper operations. (iii) Adopt IPv6 as a standard network layer protocol
    to support inherited security mechanisms [ 105]. 6.3. Privacy Preservation in
    Application Layer The application layer encompasses 2 parts: the support layer
    where the edge computing and analytical services run and the application service
    layer that provides necessary support from the IoT infrastructure. IoT applications
    are also highly versatile and heterogonous with varying needs, which makes it
    a challenge to offer a standard support. Different applications target different
    domains with unique data collection requirements, which may require different
    security measures. Therefore, the application layer security considerations/requirements
    differ from the previous two layers in the following sense: (1) Nontechnical:
    (a) Privacy awareness: makes users aware of private data collection, potential
    risks, and how to safely use IoT services and avoid private information leakage.
    (b) Security management: strengthens resources, physical security information,
    password management, etc. (2) Technical: (a) Cryptography: fingerprint technology,
    digital watermarking, anonymous authentication, and homomorphic and threshold
    cryptography. (b) Key agreements: incorporate symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems
    and certification transfer technology. 7. Conclusion The Internet of Things has
    the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did two decades ago. Nevertheless,
    any new technology faces several technical and nontechnical challenges. The highly
    diverse IoT application domains, resource-constrained IoT devices, and heterogeneity
    of both devices and platforms hinder the development of a standard IoT framework.
    However, privacy stands out as a critical concern that inhibits the widespread
    adoption IoT. The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead to huge security breaks
    and significantly hurt user privacy by exposing personal data. To promote IoT
    adoption and relieve user concerns, platforms, applications, and infrastructures
    must seriously take privacy into consideration. In this survey paper, we outline
    the major privacy threats in IoT environments and discuss the impact of IoT evolution
    on each threat. Privacy concerns such as user identification lead to a much bigger
    threat such as profiling. We surveyed the proposed solutions that overcome various
    privacy concerns and security threats in IoT environments. Most of the proposed
    solutions fall into one of the following categories: (1) authentication and authorization,
    (2) edge computing mediators, (3) data anonymization, and (4) data summarization.
    Consequently, several efforts were focused on providing lightweight authentication
    and keying establishment mechanisms, implementing frameworks based on device fingerprinting
    techniques, and introducing context-aware access control models. Although the
    proposed solutions can relieve some of the privacy concerns in IoT scenarios,
    there is a clear lack of performance evaluation and assessment in real-life scenarios.
    Furthermore, there is a conflict between protecting user privacy and the granularity
    of data access needed to provide better services. This raises the challenge of
    how to support consumer-specific privacy preferences while maintaining the same
    level of service. Such a challenge could be addressed using data anonymization.
    The paper then points out the required measures to preserve privacy in the different
    layers of the IoT stack. Our recommendation for IoT-oriented privacy preservation
    in IoT environments is as follows. First, take security measures into consideration
    at the device layer including access control and authentication, data encryption,
    secure channel based on IPSec, and cryptography. Second, reduce network management
    complexity, set up cohesive authentication mechanism, and adoption of IPv6 must
    be considered in the platform layer. In conclusion, privacy preserving is a shared
    responsibility in which all parties much actively engage and cooperate to provide
    safe IoT environments yet enjoy what IoT may offer. Technology manufacturer must
    design IoT devices with integrated privacy and security measures. Infrastructures
    must implement IoT-oriented mechanisms to prevent privacy leaks and address security
    threats from the ground up. IoT applications must notify users of what data is
    collected and the purpose of collection. IoT users must take extra cautions when
    they authorize access to their private data and better understand the potential
    consequences of any associated risks resulting from any misuse of such data. Conflicts

    The current IoT ecosystem is Cloud centric which can not handle a diverse set
    of IoT applications and services, especially those demanding real time response.
    This paper proposes an Edge Computing (EC) architecture that provides an intermediate
    computing layer for IoT data. The proposed architecture utilizes Virtual IoT Devices
    (VID) for local data processing, management of physical IoT devices and quick
    reaction using actuators. A prototype of the EC system is developed and early

    I. Introduction Cloud Computing infrastructures have become central to many IoT
    ecosystems. Now-a-days, consumers are relying on applications and services that
    are directly or indirectly (through operators reliance) supported by Cloud Computing
    Systems [1]. In parallel, advancement in mobile computing and manufacturing technologies
    have led to an explosion in consumer devices like Smartphones, tablets, smart
    watches, fitness trackers, virtual reality devices, IoT sensors, actuators and
    more. It is becoming increasingly challenging to process the diverse nature and
    huge volume of data generated by these devices [1]. Such Big Data are characterized
    by volume, veracity, velocity and variety. IoT applications and services dealing
    with such Big Data rely on Cloud Computing to generate information patterns, high-level
    abstraction and further processing. But emerging and next generation IoT scenarios
    (e.g. autonomous vehicles) require real-time data processing and actuation which
    demand IoT data to be processed near to its origin i.e. the edge of the IoT networks.
    Edge Computing (EC) [2], [3] enables local and distributed treatment of data and
    has gained much momentum from both the academia and industry. EC is characterized
    by (i) proximity to end-users, (ii) dense geographical distribution, (iii) open
    computing platform through industry alliances, (iv) support for high mobility
    and (v) value addition for consumer IoT services. Utilizing the EC platforms,
    IoT applications and services are operated from the edge of IoT networks and from
    devices like access points, set-top boxes, road side units and IoT gateways. Such
    efforts in turn reduce latency, improve QoS, allow real time data analysis and
    actuation resulting in superior user experience in consumer IoT applications and
    services. Additionally, EC saves bandwidth as the data are processed at the edge
    of the network. Due to dense geographic coverage and distributed operations, the
    EC paradigm promotes fault tolerance and reliability [4]. Fig. 1. Edge computing
    architecture Show All In this paper we explore the benefits of EC for roadside
    assistance IoT services and sensor data fusion in autonomous vehicles. To achieve
    them, we propose an Edge Computing architecture that integrates the concept of
    Virtual IoT Device (VID) for (i) IoT data validation, (ii) metadata annotation
    and (iii) local data processing based on predefined policies. The VID integration
    is the novel aspect of the architecture that allows bandwidth saving, avoid computational
    overhead in a centralized Cloud and provides faster reaction through actuation.
    Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the proposed ED
    architecture, its building blocks and operational steps. Section III presents
    an prototyping of the concept and evaluation results. SECTION II. Edge Computing
    Architecture The Edge Computing architecture is depicted in Fig. 1 which includes
    the support from a Cloud Computing platform for long term data storage and statistical
    data analysis. The architecture components are described below. A. Collection
    Proxies The sensors and actuators communicate using many different technologies
    and communication protocols. The collection proxies are a set of software drivers
    and scripts for such communication technologies (3G, Wi-Fi, BLE etc.) and protocols
    (HTTP, CoAP etc.). This layer ensures that a variety of IoT devices can connect
    to the proposed Edge Computing architecture. B. Data Validation This is the first
    step into IoT data processing where the sensor data is checked against some parameters.
    This is necessary due to the fact that, sensors deployed in smart cities, agriculture
    fields, vehicles are prone to noise which may alter the sensed data when transmitted.
    Therefore, checking and validating the sensor data ensures that it is correct.
    If the data is found to be corrupted, it is discarded. Performing the validation
    at the Edge saves bandwidth and reduces the load on a central Cloud Computing
    infrastructure. C. Metadata Annotation Once an IoT data is validated to be correct,
    it is enriched with additional information creating metadata [5]. For example,
    along with temperature data of an agriculture field, the unit, time stamp, location,
    unique ID of the sensor are important. This eases the data processing at the virtual
    IoT devices. D. Security IoT ecosystems often deploy numerous constrained devices
    which can not run complex encryption decryption algorithms needed for data security.
    In such a case, the Edge Computing platform is configured to encrypt any payload
    with AES-256 before communicating that to the Cloud Computing platform. E. Virtual
    IoT Device The concept of virtual sensors, its usefulness for data processing
    and taxonomy has been widely discussed in the state-of-the-art [6]. In [7], we
    have extended the virtualization concept to actuators as well and introduced the
    generic concept of “Virtual IoT Device” (VID). It is characterized as - (i) a
    virtualized instance of one or more sensors or actuators, (ii) hosted in a Cloud
    or Edge Computing platform and (iii) provides device description including a list
    of capabilities in terms of events, properties and action to facilitate data processing
    and communication to actuators. In this paper, we utilize the VID for IoT data
    processing as well as assist in data validation and metadata annotation. The VID
    functional architecture is depicted in Fig. 2. The data processing requirements
    are written in an application script which is loaded on the VID during runtime.
    The runtime environment can be implemented using Docker which makes the VID run
    on a platform independent of the underlying operating system. For data validation,
    the application script will check the sensor value against its range of output.
    If the sensor value within the range, it is then considered as correct otherwise
    it is treated as corrupted and dropped. The range of the sensor is found by searching
    in the corresponding device description. Fig. 2. Functional components of a virtual
    IoT device Show All For metadata annotation, we use the parameters mentioned in
    IETF draft of Media Types for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)1. A method is written
    into the application script which allows enables the metadata annotation. This
    step is important if the IoT data is going to be reasoned with semantic web technologies
    [8] in the Cloud Computing Environment. A local database houses the processed
    data temporarily and can also be used as a buffer for incoming IoT data before
    processing. The next step performed by the application script is data processing
    whose logic depends on the use case scenarios. For example, in a large agriculture
    field, the soil moisture values of several sensors must be averaged before triggering
    irrigation pump. For a smart city application measuring highest temperature in
    a city must collect several sensor data to compute the highest among them. Such
    logics can also be pre-configured into several scripts and used as necessary.
    F. Actuation A unique advantage of the Edge Computing architecture is that it
    allows quick reaction to events through actuation. Once the local data processing
    is complete in a VID, if certain conditions are met, it can trigger an actuation.
    For example, switching on an irrigation pump for an agriculture field. This actuation
    can be done locally which improves the real-time operational aspects. SECTION
    III. Prototype and Results We have created a prototype of the proposed architecture
    that integrates a VID component for data validation, metadata annotation and data
    processing. The Edge Computing system is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 hardware
    and currently supports IoT devices exchanging data using HTTP and CoAP over BLE
    and Wi-Fi. We utilized the platform in the context of a smart city scenario where
    connected vehicles provide sensor data about city temperature. We have applied
    the Edge Computing philosophy to two main use cases. The first use case considers
    a road side assistance system where a consumer can speak to a device seeking help.
    The audio data must be treated locally to remove the background traffic noise
    before the request is transferred to a service provider. The second use case targets
    a prototype high precision positioning system in future autonomous cars. Here
    different subsystems are continuously generating data about the car environment.
    Local data fusion is critical here to develop and exchange local dynamic maps
    (LDM). The software environment together with MongoDB takes close to 300MB of
    spaces on the Raspberry Pi (which supports 32GB memory card). The application
    script is developed using NodeJS and its memory footprint is less than 1MB. During
    the operational cycle of the mentioned use case scenario, the CPU load varies
    between 5–15 percent. SECTION IV. Conclusion In a nutshell, this paper presents
    an Edge Computing architecture for local data processing and IoT device management.
    Virtual IoT Device concept has been utilized to accomplish both computation on
    IoT data and quick reaction through actuators. The EC system is applied to two
    scenarios on roadside assistance and vehicular data computation. Our evaluation
    points at lightweight aspect of the solution. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    of IEEE Publication Principles  After careful consideration by a duly constituted
    committee, an author of this article, Hamid Reza Karimi, was found to have acted
    in violation of the IEEE Principles of Ethical Publishing by artificially inflating
    the number of citations to this article. This paper addresses the problem of sliding
    mode control (SMC) for a type of uncertain time-delay nonlinear descriptor systems
    represented by T-S fuzzy models. One crucial contributing factor is to put forward
    a novel integral fuzzy switching manifold involved with time delay. Compared with
    previous results, the key benefit of the new manifold is that the input matrices
    via different subsystems are permitted to be diverse, and thus much more applicability
    will be achieved. By resorting to Frobenius'' theorem and double orthogonal complement,
    the existence condition of the fuzzy manifold is presented. The admissibility
    conditions of sliding motion with a strictly dissipative performance are further
    provided. Then, the desired fuzzy SMC controller is synthesized by analyzing the
    reachability of the manifold. Moreover, an adaptive fuzzy SMC controller is also
    proposed to adapt the input saturation and the matched uncertainty with unknown
    upper bounds. The feasibility and virtue of our theoretical findings are demonstrated
    by a fuzzy SMC controller implementation for a practical system about the pendulum.

    I. Introduction Descriptor systems, also known as singular systems or semistate
    systems, can naturally depict a variety of practical systems, including circuits
    systems, power systems, and economic systems [1]. Except for the finite dynamic
    modes existed in state-space systems, the descriptor systems also contain impulse
    modes and nondynamic modes, which make their analysis more complicated [2]. Due
    to their tighter expressions for representing actual independent parametric perturbation,
    descriptor systems have been adopted to design controllers and filters in various
    areas of research for theoretical development as well as for real applications
    (see [3]–[8]). It is worth mentioning that due to the difficulties in constructing
    appropriate Lyapunov functions and the high complexity in analyzing the existence
    and uniqueness of the solution, most of the existing theoretical results are only
    applicable to linear descriptor models, while most practical descriptor systems
    are highly complicated. A feasible idea to overcome this issue is to represent
    a highly nonlinear descriptor system by the T–S fuzzy descriptor model, which
    is composed of a group of linear descriptor submodels [9]. In this case, a highly
    nonlinear descriptor system can be analyzed by well-established linear descriptor
    system theory. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the T–S fuzzy descriptor model
    can effectively reduce the number of linear models in comparison with fuzzy model
    based on state-expression [10]–[19]. In view of these significant advantages,
    many researchers have been devoted to research on fuzzy descriptor systems (see
    [20]–[25]). For instance, Lin et al. [20] studied a class of time-delay fuzzy
    descriptor systems, and stability/stabilization conditions were offered by resorting
    to Lyapunov function. The problem about nonfragile stabilization with guaranteed
    cost performance was investigated in [22] for a type of uncertain nonlinear delayed
    descriptor systems depicted by T–S fuzzy models, and the desired fuzzy feedback
    controller was designed via parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. In
    [25], a systematic way to generalize the controller design for discrete-time T–S
    fuzzy descriptor models was provided by using delayed Lyapunov functions, and
    the well-known Finsler’s lemma was used to avoid the explicit substitution of
    the closed-loop dynamics. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ the cows to \ndetect disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at\
    \ milking stations on dairy \nfarms. As another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an\
    \ open-source analytic platform that uses \nmachine learning to categorize iceberg\
    \ lettuces to improve the actual yield and crop mar\nFigure 1. Smart farming components\
    \ that facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data.\nThe decision-making\
    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 838\n7 of 18\nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend\
    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\
    \ to provide compatibility among different compo-\nnents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information for\ndecision making; scalability\
    \ that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources;\nreliability\
    \ to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy\
    \ to\npreserve the system safety and conﬁdentiality; and, ﬁnally compliance with\
    \ the related\npolicies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisﬁes\
    \ all these requirements\ncan enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase\
    \ productivity, proﬁtability, and\nperformance while decreasing resource waste.\n\
    \ \nbuild trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that\

    \ systems. There is also the need to \nset standards for data-sharing practices\
    \ and to apply policies to determine accountability \nand penalties in the case\
    \ of possible disputes. Other regulations related to food safety, \nsupply chain\
    \ management, disease monitoring, and other applications can also impact \nagriculture\
    \ data management and processing. These policies can be renewed to be appli-\n\
    cable to new and emerging agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements\
    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\
    \ purposes. \nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend consideration\
    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\
    \ data processing. These \nrequirements enable seamless integration of data, system,\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    The Internet of things (IoT) is emerging as the next big wave of digital presence
    for billions of devices on the Internet. Smart cities are a practical manifestation
    of IoT, with the goal of efficient, reliable, and safe delivery of city utilities
    like water, power, and transport to residents, through their intelligent management.
    A data-driven IoT software platform is essential for realizing manageable and
    sustainable smart utilities and for novel applications to be developed upon them.
    Here, we propose such service-oriented software architecture to address 2 key
    operational activities in a smart utility: the IoT fabric for resource management
    and the data and application platform for decision-making. Our design uses Open
    Web standards and evolving network protocols, cloud and edge resources, and streaming
    big data platforms. We motivate our design requirements using the smart water
    management domain; some of these requirements are unique to developing nations.
    We also validate the architecture within a campus-scale IoT testbed at the Indian
    Institute of Science, Bangalore and present our experiences. Our architecture
    is scalable to a township or city while also generalizable to other smart utility
    domains. Our experiences serve as a template for other similar efforts, particularly
    in emerging markets and highlight the gaps and opportunities for a data-driven
    IoT software architecture for smart cities. 1 INTRODUCTION The rapid emergence
    and deployment of the Internet of things (IoT) is causing millions of devices
    and sensors to come online as part of public and private networks.1 This marks
    the convergence of cheap sensing hardware, pervasive wireless and wired communication
    networks, and the democratization of computing capacity through clouds. It also
    reflects the growing need to leverage automation to enhance the efficiency of
    public systems and quality of life for the society. While consumer devices such
    as smart phones and fitness bands highlight the ubiquity of IoT in a digitally
    immersed lifestyle, of equal (arguably, greater) importance is the role of IoT
    in managing infrastructure such as city utilities and industrial manufacturing.2,
    3 Smart cities and industrial IoT deploy sensing and actuation capabilities as
    part of physical systems such as power and water grids, road networks, manufacturing
    equipment, etc. This enables the use of data-driven approaches to efficiently
    and reliably manage the operations of such vital cyberphysical systems.4-6 As
    the number of IoT devices soon reaches the billions, it is essential to have a
    distributed software architecture that facilitates the sustainable management
    of these physical devices and communication networks and access to their data
    streams and controls for developing innovative IoT applications. Three synergistic
    concepts come together to enable this. Service-oriented architecture (SOA)7, 8
    offers standard mechanisms and protocols for discovery, addressing, access control,
    invocation, and composition of services that are available on the World Wide Web
    (WWW), by leveraging and extending Web-based protocols such as the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP) and open representation models like the Extensible Markup Language
    (XML).9 Cloud computing is a manifestation of this paradigm where infrastructure,
    platform, and software resources are available “as a service” (IaaS, PaaS, and
    SaaS), often served from geographically distributed data centers worldwide. These
    offer economies of scale and enable access to elastic resources using a pay-as-you-go
    model.10 Such commodity clusters on the cloud have also enabled the growth of
    big data platforms that allow data-driven applications to be composed and scaled
    on tens or hundreds of virtual machines (VMs) and deal with both data volume and
    velocity, among other dimensions.11 Unlike traditional enterprise or scientific
    applications, however, the IoT domain is distinct in the way these technologies
    converge to support emerging applications. (1) IoT integrates hardware, communication,
    software, and analytics and links the physical and the digital world. Hence, infrastructure
    management, including that of cloud, fog, and edge devices, is an intrinsic part
    of the software architecture.12 (2) These devices and services may not always
    be on the WWW and, instead, connect within private networks or the public Internet
    (not WWW). Hence, network heterogeneity is also a concern. (3) Communication connectivity
    and, indeed, even their hardware availability may not be reliable, with transient
    network and hardware faults being common in wide-area deployments. (4) The scale
    of the IoT infrastructure services (and microservices) is likely to be orders
    of magnitude more than traditional business and eCommerce services, eventually
    reaching billions. (5) Lastly, the potential applications that will be built on
    top of IoT is not yet well defined, and the scope of innovation is vast, provided
    that the software architecture is open and extensible. These necessitate a software
    architecture that encompasses a management fabric and a data-driven middleware
    that can leverage SOA, clouds, and big data platforms in a meaningful manner to
    support the needs of IoT applications. One can envision convergence onto a core
    set of interoperable open standards, an approach that contributed to the success
    of the WWW using HTTP, Hypertext Markup Language, Uniform Resource Locator (URL),
    etc, specifications from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), or they may
    fragment into vertical silos pushed by proprietary consortia, such as seen in
    public clouds from Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure (who themselves are evolving
    for IoT). Both can prove to be successful, but we argue the need for the former.
    The few major public cloud providers have large customer bases. Hence, custom
    application programming interfaces (APIs) that they offer based on Web standards
    will have a captive market. On the other hand, IoT will need to leverage Open
    Web and Internet standards, both existing and emerging, to allow for the interoperability
    and reuse of existing tools and software stacks. This is particularly of concern
    to developing countries with megacities that are transitioning to smart cities.
    Such an open approach will also catalyze the development of novel applications
    for consuming the data and application services exposed by the city utility. Contributions.
    In this article, we propose a service-oriented and data-driven software architecture
    for smart city utilities. This is motivated by representative applications for
    smart water management and validated for managing the infrastructure and applications
    within a smart campus IoT testbed at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
    We make the following specific contributions. (1) We characterize the requirements
    of an IoT fabric and application middleware to support innovative smart city applications.
    (2) We develop a service-oriented software architecture, based on open protocols,
    standards, and software, to meet these requirements while leveraging cloud and
    big data platforms. This includes a novel bootstrapping mechanism to on-board
    new devices and support for streaming synchronous and batch asynchronous analytics.
    (3) We integrate these technology blocks together within a real IoT field deployment
    at the IISc campus testbed, which spans sensing, communication, data integration,
    and analytics, to validate our design. Organization. The rest of this article
    is organized as follows. First, in Section 2, we offer a background of the IISc
    Smart Campus project and highlight the unique requirements of smart city deployments
    in emerging nations like India. In Sections 5, 10, 14, 20, we discuss different
    aspects of our proposed scalable, data-centric, and service-oriented software
    architecture for the smart campus. This includes sensing and communication (Section
    5), management fabric for the devices and the network (Section 10), data platforms
    for data acquisition (Section 14), and cloud and edge-based analytics for decision-making
    (Section 20). We contrast our work against related efforts globally in Section
    21, and finally offer our conclusions and discuss future directions in Section
    26. 2 BACKGROUND We present an overview of the Smart Campus project at IISc that
    is developing an IoT management fabric and an application platform for smart utility
    management. We use this, as well as our prior experience with the Los Angeles
    Smart Grid project,2 to motivate the unique needs of a smart city software architecture.
    2.1 IISc Smart Campus project The Government of India is undertaking a mission
    to upgrade 100 cities to smart cities 1 over the next several years, at a cost
    of about US $14 billion. While the exact characteristics of a “smart city” are
    loosely defined, smart energy, water and waste management, urban mobility, and
    digital services for citizens are some of the thematic areas. Several township-scale
    and community-scale research and deployment projects have been initiated to understand
    the unique aspects of smart city management in a developing country like India,
    and the role of open technology in realizing this vision. The Smart Campus project
    2at the IISc, the top graduate school in India, is one such effort to design,
    develop, and validate a campus-wide IoT fabric. This “living laboratory” will
    offer a platform to try novel IoT technologies and smart city services, with a
    captive base of about 10 000 students, faculty, staff, and family who largely
    reside on campus. The gated campus spread across 1.8 km2 has over 50 departments
    and centers and about 100 buildings that host offices, lecture halls, research
    laboratories, supercomputing facility, hostels, staff housing, restaurants, a
    health center, grocery stores, and so on (Figure 1). This is representative of
    large communities and towns in India and offers a unique real-world ecosystem
    to validate IoT technologies for smart cities. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Indian Institute of Science campus map and water infrastructure [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The project aims to design, develop,
    and deploy a reference IoT architecture as a horizontal platform that can support
    various vertical utilities such as smart power, water, and transportation management,
    with smart water management serving as the initial domain for validation of the
    fabric. In effect, the effort for this project is in sifting through and selecting
    the best practices and standards in the public domain across various layers of
    the IoT stack, integrating them into work seamlessly, and validating them for
    one canonical domain at the campus scale. By its very nature, this limits de novo
    blue-sky architectures that work in a laboratory setup but are infeasible, impractical,
    and costly or do not scale. At the same time, the architecture also offers an
    open platform for research into sensing, networking, cloud and big data platforms,
    and analytics. IISc owns and manages the water distribution network within the
    campus, and in Bangalore, like other cities in India, water supply from the city
    utility is not 24×7 but rather periodic. As a result, there are underground reservoirs
    (ground-level reservoirs [GLRs]) to buffer the water from the city''s inlets,
    large overhead tanks (OHTs) where water is pumped up to from the GLRs, and rooftop
    tanks at the building level where water is routed to from these OHTs using gravity.
    About 4 city inlets, 13 GLRs, 8 OHTs, and over 50 rooftop tanks form the campus
    water distribution network and support an average daily consumption of 4 million
    cm3 of water. Figure 1 shows these inlets, GLRs, and OHTs. The campus also consumes
    10 MW of electricity, a tangible fraction of which goes to moving water between
    the storages. The goal for smart water management is to leverage the IoT stack
    to (1) assure the quality of water that is distributed, (2) ensure the reliability
    of supply, (3) avoid wastage of water, (4) proactively and responsively maintain
    the water infrastructure, (5) reduce the costs of water and electricity used for
    pumping, and (6) engage consumers in water conservation. All of these will be
    achieved through domain-driven analytics over the rich and real-time data that
    will be available on the water network from the IoT infrastructure. The campus
    has 14 water distribution zones that are grouped into 4 logical regions for deploying
    and managing the network operations, as shown in Figure 1. Each region requires
    approximately 30 wireless motes that transmit values sampled from sensors they
    are connected to. A gateway connects clusters of these nodes and transmits the
    data to the cloud through the campus network backhaul. A combination of water
    level and quality sensors, flow meters, and smart power meters is used to sense
    the water network, with actuators for valve and pump controls planned. As we discuss
    later, the design of the ad hoc wireless network is a key operational challenge.
    At the same time, we need to ease the deployment, monitoring, and management overheads
    of the IoT infrastructure. These make for a unique validation environment for
    smart urban utility systems, with distinctive local challenges for observation,
    analytics, and actuation, compared to developed nations. In contrast, a similar
    smart campus effort by the lead author at the University of Southern California,
    Los Angeles addressed challenges of demand response optimization for smart grids.2
    There, power was assured 24 × 7 by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
    but the goal was to change the campus energy use profile, on-demand, to reduce
    the load on the city power grid as more intermittent renewable sources are included
    within their energy portfolio. Also, the entire campus was instrumented using
    proprietary smart meters from Honeywell that worked off reliable wired local area
    networks (LANs), could be centrally monitored and controlled using their custom
    software, had adequate bandwidth to push all data and analytics to the cloud,
    and carried a comparably high price tag for the solution—such high-cost and proprietary
    solutions are impractical for emerging nations. 2.2 Desiderata Figure 2 illustrates
    the functional layers of an IoT software architecture, spanning sensors and communication
    to data acquisition and analytics. We distinguish 2 parts to the IoT architecture:
    first, the IoT fabric that manages the hardware and communication infrastructure
    and offers core resource management and networking and, second, the application
    platform that acquires the data and enables analytics and decision-making that
    is fed back to the infrastructure. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Functional
    Internet-of-things architecture [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    There are several guiding principles and high-level requirements for the software
    architecture.13 Scalablity. Scalability of the architecture is paramount. The
    design should not have any intrinsic limitations or assumptions that prevent it
    from scaling citywide even as the validation is for a township scale. The system
    should weakly scale with the number of sensors, devices, and motes that are part
    of the IoT infrastructure, the rate at which data are acquired, the number of
    domains and analytics, and the number of users of the system. This recognizes
    the need to validate the design at small and medium scales to de-risk it before
    expanding to large-scale urban environments, without fundamentally changing the
    model. Generalizability. The design should be generalizable enough to include
    additional utility domains such as smart power or waste management. While the
    sensors and analytics themselves can be domain dependent (or optionally shared
    across domains), the enabling fabric and platform layers must remain common across
    domains—either conceptually or using different implementations or configurations.
    Modular manageability. The architecture should allow new sensors, devices, data
    sources, and applications to be included over time with limited overheads. The
    interface boundaries should be clearly defined to allow minimal configuration
    overheads. Support must be present for both static and transient devices, edge
    and cloud resources, and for physical and crowdsourced data collection and actuation.
    Reliability and accessibility. The architecture should monitor and ensure the
    health of the sensing, communication, and computation layers, with autonomous
    actions where possible. Depending on the application domain, the quality of service
    (QoS) for data collection, decision-making, and enactment may be mission critical
    or a best effort. Resource usage should be sensitive to current computing, networking,
    and energy capacities. Open standards. The architecture should use open protocols
    and standards, supported by standardization bodies and community efforts, as opposed
    to proprietary technologies or closed consortia. It will leverage existing open-source
    big data platforms and tooling and contribute to them to facilitate their growth.
    It should balance the benefits of emerging IoT standards and the reliability of
    mature ones, even if repurposed from other fields. It should be extensible and
    incorporate standards as they evolve. Cost effectiveness. The design process will
    consider the costs for purchasing, developing, integrating, deploying, and managing
    the architecture. These include hardware, software, and service costs, as well
    as human capital to configure and maintain the IoT fabric, in the context of emerging
    nations (where human cost may be lower but technology costs higher). It should
    leverage commodity and open-source technologies where possible. This recognizes
    that technology is a means to a sustainable end, rather than the end in itself.
    Designing such low-cost, innovative, and sustainable technologies is locally termed
    as Jugaad.14 Security and auditing. The access to devices, data, analytics, and
    actuation services should be secured to prevent unauthorized access over the network,
    or even if the physical device is compromised. An audit trail must be established,
    and provenance must ensure data ownership and trust. Mechanisms for open data
    sharing and crowdsourcing should be exposed, with a possible micropayment model.
    3 SENSING AND COMMUNICATION Sensing, actuation, and communication are integral
    to the physical IoT fabric. The service-oriented software platform must be cognizant
    of their characteristics to allow for fabric management. Here, we discuss the
    capabilities and constraints of the edge and networking devices in the Smart Campus
    project for the water domain, which can be generalized to other utilities. 3.1
    Sensing and actuation There are several types of physical sensors that are deployed
    for collecting real-time observations on the state of the water distribution network
    within the campus and to perform demand-supply water balance studies. Flow meters
    use electromagnetic induction to measure the volume of water flowing through the
    pipes in the distribution network, and pressure pads observe the water pressure
    at various points in the network. These help us understand the flow of water through
    the major distribution lines across campus and ensure sufficient pressure is available
    to deliver water. They are typically placed between the city inlet, the GLR, and
    the OHT. Smart power meters at pumping stations let us know the energy usage for
    actively moving water between the various tanks and can be correlated with the
    flow meters and pressure pads. In addition, water level meters measure the depth
    of water in the OHT, the GLR, and the rooftop tanks continuously using ultrasonic
    signals to estimate the range from the top of these tanks to the water surface.15
    By knowing the dimensions of the water tanks and when the pumps are operating,
    we can estimate the supply and the demand of water in individual buildings. These
    meters also record ambient temperature. The water level sensors can also serve
    as actuators that control the pumps and the valves in the future. Physical actuators
    will automate the enactment of pumping and distribution decisions, in the absence
    of which, an SMS sent to a cell phone present with the pump operator can serve
    as a manual feedback control. Another form of actuation is to control the fabric
    itself. For example, the duty cycles of wireless motes and sampling rates for
    the various sensors and observation types can be controlled on the fly based on
    decision made by the management and analytics layers using information on the
    network, energy and computation resources, and the current application requirements.
    Another important class of sensing and actuation within IoT is through crowdsourcing
    to supplement physical devices.16 Typically, crowdsourcing can be used when the
    costs for deploying physical devices are high or to engage the community through
    citizen science. Physical water quality sensors that can measure chemical properties
    are costly, and the number of potable water dispensers on campus is large. Hence,
    we leverage the IISc residents in collecting quality measurements from dispensers
    that are distributed across buildings. Reagent strips available for US $0.25 can
    be dipped in the water sample and placed against a water quality color card (Figure
    3A), and our Android smart phone app (Figure 3B) can be used to photograph and
    capture the color changes to the strip after normalizing for ambient light using
    the quality card.17 This reports water quality parameters such as nitrates, chlorine,
    hardness, pH, etc. The app can also be used to report maintenance issues such
    as water leakage and drips, water overflow or underflow in buildings, etc. Such
    participatory sensing engages the campus users in their own health and instills
    a community value. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Crowdsourced data
    collection of water quality. A, Water quality card; B, SmartWater reporting app
    [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 3.2 Networking and communication
    3.2.1 Network protocols and infrastructure Communication networks are required
    to evacuate data from the sensors to the data platform or to trigger the actuators
    based on control decisions. Gateway devices and backend computing infrastructure
    hosting the platform, such as cloud VMs, are on public or private infrastructure
    networks such as wired or wireless LANs. Accessing the sensors and edge devices
    becomes less challenging if such infrastructure networks are available within
    their vicinity or if 2G/3G/4G connectivity can be made use of. However, field
    deployments may not be within the range of a LAN or a wireless LAN, cellular connectivity
    may be costly, or devices that use these communication protocols may consume higher
    energy, which will be a constraint if they are powered by battery or solar renewable.
    As an alternative, ad hoc and peer-to-peer (P2P) network protocols are popular
    for IoT deployments. There are multiple standards that can be leveraged here.
    Bluetooth low energy has gained popularity for personal area networks (PANs) due
    to their ubiquity in smart phones. It is designed for P2P communication between
    proximate devices, such as smart phones and IoT beacons, within tens of feet of
    each other, and supports bandwidth tens of kilobytes per second. Alternatively,
    IEEE 802.15.4 specifies the physical and medium access control protocol layers
    for PANs.18 It operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio
    bands, typically 2.4 GHz, and forms the basis for ZigBee. It has been extended
    specifically for IoT usage as well. IEEE 802.15.4g was proposed for P2P communications
    and for smart utility networks like gas, water, and power metering. The Thread
    Group, including consortium members Samsung, Google Nest, Qualcomm, and ARM, also
    uses this standard for an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)–addressable Thread
    protocol for smart home automation. More broadly, IETF''s IPv6 over low-power
    wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) extends IPv6 support for IEEE 802.15.4
    on low-power devices.19 A single IPv6 packet has a maximum transmission unit (MTU)
    of 1280 bytes, which fits in traditional Ethernet links having an MTU of 1500
    bytes. However, IEEE 802.15.4 only has an MTU of 127 bytes, and 6LoWPAN acts as
    an adaptation layer to allow IPv6 packets to be fragmented and reassembled at
    this data link layer. It also enables IPv6 link-local auto-addressing and provides
    datagram compression. The range and bandwidth of wireless networks depend on the
    transmission power, the size of antenna, and the terrain. Typically, 2 of the
    3 dimensions—high bandwidth, low power, and long range—are achievable. PANs choose
    a lower range in favor of higher speed and lower power. For example, ZigBee with
    2.4 GHz offers a range of 10-100 m, line of sight, and a bandwidth of ≈30 kB/s.
    Using the subgigahertz spectrum offers a longer range for wide area networks (WANs),
    due to low attenuation of the low-frequency waves, and also a lower speed of ≈5
    kB/s. While IEEE 802.15.4g supports this frequency, LoRaWAN technology has been
    developed specifically for such long ranges of a kilometer using, for example,
    an 868-MHz subgigahertz radio in the IoT context.20 LoRa uses a star-of-stars
    topology and is well suited for applications with a low data rate of 0.25-5 kB/s,
    but the current implementation lacks support for the Internet Protocol (IP) stack
    and uses a proprietary chipset. For the Smart Campus network fabric, the buildings
    have W/LAN access, and devices within WiFi range can use the backbone network.
    However, many of the OHTs, GLRs, and pump houses are not within WiFi range. Hence,
    we deploy an ad hoc 6LoWPAN wireless sensor network (WSN) for such field devices
    (Figures 4 and 5). We use Zolertia''s RE-Mote21 wireless hardware platform that
    has a dual radio of a 2.4-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 and a subgigahertz 868/915-MHz radio-frequency
    transceiver. It runs an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU at a 32-MHz clock speed, with 512 kB
    of programmable flash and 32 kB of RAM. These motes connect to the sensors to
    acquire data and pass control signals, act as WSN relays, or are the border router
    connected to the gateway device. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Wireless
    sensor network deployment at the Indian Institute of Science [Colour figure can

    Network protocol stack of the Internet-of-things fabric [Colour figure can be
    viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] A Raspberry Pi 3 serves as the gateway that
    connects to the border router through a USB interface. Besides connecting the
    WSN to the campus backbone network, the Pi also acts as a proxy between the IPv6
    WSN and the IPv4 campus network using the tunslip utility. Thus, all motes are
    IP addressable, with end-to-end IP-based connectivity across the campus. The use
    of such diverse network protocols coordinated through a gateway is generalized
    as an area sensor network that serves as a bridging layer for composable regions
    of sensor networks that can scale to a city in a federated manner.22 A novel use
    of crowdsourcing uses people as data sherpas when sensors require many WSN hops
    to reach a building W/LAN but where human footfall is high.13 Here, data from
    the sensor are broadcast using a Bluetooth low-energy beacon, which is picked
    up by the Smart Campus app on users'' phones and pushed to our data platform through
    3G/WiFi. Lastly, small-scale experiments using LoRaWAN are also being investigated.
    While they may be adequate for periodic water level or flow meter data, their
    bandwidth will limit the reuse of the network fabric for other data-heavy IoT
    domains. 3.2.2 Network deployment design The WSNs need to be designed and deployed
    across regions of the campus to ensure robust QoS and avoid data loss due to packet
    collisions and scattering of waves by dense buildings. SmartConnect23 is an in-house
    tool for designing IEEE 802.15.4 networks. When given the sensor locations, their
    expected data traffic, the required QoS, and possible locations for relays, it
    identifies the lowest-cost relay placement with a given path redundancy in the
    multihop WSN. SmartConnect uses 2 field measurements for pairwise placement of
    the motes at each candidate relay location: (1) the minimum received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI), for which the packet error rate (PER) is consistently ≤2%, and
    (2) the maximum radio reception distance, Rmax, for which the packet delivery
    rate is ≥95%. Figure 6 captures the results of several experiments with the subgigahertz
    WSN deployed at different regions of the campus to plan the deployment. Figure
    6A shows the result of conducting wired back-to-back testing of motes to determine
    the optimal operation characteristics under ideal conditions. This offers a best-case
    baseline on the PER as we increase the signal strength, ie, when intermote distance
    is not a concern. After calibrating the devices with the minimum RSSI, controlled
    experiments were conducted to obtain the practical operating distance range between
    motes for the required QoS, as shown in Figure 6B. Here, Pout indicates the upper
    bound of the PER, whereas Pbad is the probability of a link having a PER worse
    than Pout, as the link distance is varied. Based on this, a minimum RSSI of −97
    dBm and a maximum range of Rmax=400 m were chosen for the field deployments. These
    were further validated on the field to capture the effect of topological characteristics
    on the network range, such as open spaces, buildings, tree cover, etc.24 Figure
    6C shows the heatmap of the signal strength and ranges. Here, R3 is in a wooded
    area and R4 is near dormitory buildings, and both show higher signal attenuation.
    R5 is measured near the recreational center with open spaces and has a higher
    signal strength. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Network characteristics
    for RE-Mote on the field. A, Packet error rate (PER) versus received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI); B, Fraction of links Pbad with outage probability>Pout at different
    distance ranges; C, Heatmap of the RSSI range at different locations on campus
    [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Based on these experiments,
    for a QoS delay of 200 ms, potential locations were suggested by SmartConnect
    for relay placement. These targeted experiments and analytical planning avoid
    having to actually deploy different permutations of the relays at every possible
    field location to determine the optimal placement for a reliable WSN. Once the
    motes are deployed, we implement the routing protocol for low-power lossy networks
    (RPL)25 for the formation and maintenance of the WSN (Figure 5). RPL maintains
    a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph among the motes, with every node
    having one or more multihop path(s) to the root, which is the border router. This
    supports multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point communication
    patterns. Packets traversing through such a multihop low-power and lossy network
    may get lost in transit due to various link outages at intermediate relay nodes.
    To ensure a high packet delivery ratio in the low-power and lossy networks running
    RPL, we include a lightweight functionality, LinkPeek,26 to the network layer''s
    packet forwarding task. Here, the forwarding node iteratively retransmits the
    packet to its next best parent in the same Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic
    Graph whenever a preset medium access control layer retransmission count for the
    current best parent is exceeded. 4 IoT FABRIC MANAGEMENT A high-level protocol
    stack for the entire software architecture is shown in Figure 7. In this, fabric
    management deals with the health and life cycle of devices present in the IoT
    deployment. The primary devices that require this management are the sensors,
    actuators, motes, and gateway devices that are physically deployed in the field.
    The fabric also ensures that endpoints are available to manage the devices and
    to acquire data or send signals. Here, we describe the service-oriented fabric
    management architecture for the IISc Smart Campus. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer

    for life cycle and discovery IETF''s Constrained RESTful Environments working
    group (CoRE WG)27 is developing standards for frameworks that manage resource-oriented
    applications in constrained environments such as IoT. It is intended to align
    with existing Web standards like REST and HTTP, as well as emerging IoT network
    standards for IPv6. This makes it well suited for designing a standards-compliant
    service-oriented IoT architecture, and we leverage several specifications from
    CoRE. Figure 8 shows an interaction diagram of various service components that
    enable fabric management (orange boxes and arrows). We adopt a stateful resource
    model, similar to REST, for managing devices as services in the IoT deployment.
    These go beyond just the domain sensors and actuators and include network devices
    and gateways. Each device exposes one or more resources through a service endpoint,
    each of which is either an observable entity that can be sensed or a controllable
    entity that can be changed and the setup updated. For example, a resource can
    represent domain observations, such as the water level or pump state, fabric telemetry,
    such as the battery level of a mote, or a device setup state, such as a sampling
    interval. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Interactions between architecture
    components for fabric management and data acquisition [Colour figure can be viewed
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Two key services for the life cycle management and
    discovery are the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)28 and the CoRE
    Resource Directory (RD).29 Both of these are standards-compliant directory services,
    but play distinct roles in our design. LDAP is used to store static metadata about
    various devices and resources that are, or can be, present in the IoT fabric.
    We use it as a bootstrapping mechanism for devices to update their initial state
    during deployment. This reduces the overhead of deployment and configuration of
    the devices on the field, which may be done by a nontechnical person, and instead
    have the device pull its configuration from the LDAP once it is online. RD, on
    the other hand, is responsible for maintaining the state and endpoint of resources
    that are currently active and is used for the dynamic discovery of resources and
    interacting with them. RD supports frequent updates and, importantly, a lifetime
    capability that automatically removes a service entry if it does not renew its
    lease within the interval specified when registering. This allows an eventually
    consistent set of active devices to be maintained in the RD, even if the devices
    do not cleanly de-register. Both these services are hosted on cloud VMs to allow
    discovery by external clients and sharing across private networks. We adopt the
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),30 part of the CoRE specifications, as
    our service invocation protocol. CoAP is designed as the equivalent of REST over
    HTTP for constrained devices and is well suited for our 6LoWPAN network. CoAP
    has a compact specification of service messages, uses the User Datagram Protocol
    by default, has direct mappings to/from a stateless HTTP protocol, and support
    Datagram Transport Layer Security. It has both request/response and observe/notify
    models of interaction and offers differential reliability using confirmable/nonconfirmable
    message types. We use CoAP as the default service protocol for all our devices
    on campus, including motes on the WSN and gateways like the Pi on the LAN. CoAP
    is an asynchronous protocol where requests and responses are sent as independent
    messages correlated by a token. It requires both the service and the client to
    be network addressable and accessible to each other—this may not be possible for
    devices that are behind a firewall on a private network or data center. At the
    same time, while CoAP''s use of the User Datagram Protocol makes it lightweight
    within the private network, it can be lossy when operating over the public Internet.
    To address these 2 limitations, we switch from CoAP to traditional REST/HTTP over
    TCP/IP when interacting with services and clients on the public Internet from
    the campus LAN. Two proxy services present at the campus DMZ, CoAP to HTTP (C2H)
    and HTTP to CoAP (H2C), enable this translation. Similarly, within the cloud data
    center, we use an H2C proxy to switch back to CoAP in the private network to access
    the RD that is based on CoAP. While devices in the WSN are IP addressable and
    their CoAP service endpoints accessible by clients, they operate as an IPv6 network
    on 6LoWPAN. Hence, yet another proxy is present at the gateway device to translate
    between IPv4 used in the campus and the public network to IPv6 used within the
    WSN. One of the advantages of leveraging emerging IoT standards from IETF and
    IEEE is that these protocol translations are well defined, transparent, and seamless.
    These various services are shown in Figure 8 and implemented using open-source
    software, either used as is or extended by us to reflect recent evolutions of
    the specifications. We use the Eclipse Californium (Cf) CoAP framework31 for the
    CoRE services such as Resource Directory, CoAP clients and services, and the C2H
    and H2C proxies on nonconstrained devices that can run Java, such as the Pi and
    cloud VMs. We also use the Erbium (Er) CoAP service and client implementation
    for the ContikiOS running on the embedded mote platforms.32 The Eclipse Copper
    (Cu) plugin for Firefox provides an interactive client to invoke CoAP services
    and browse the RD. Apache Directory Service serves as our LDAP implementation.
    4.2 Device bootstrapping and discovery Each IoT device that comes online needs
    to determine its endpoint, the resources it hosts, and their metadata. Some are
    static to the device, whereas others depend on the device''s spatial placement.
    This device configuration during on-boarding has to be autonomic to allow manual
    deployment of the last-mile field devices by nontechnical personnel. We propose
    such an automated process for the bootstrapping using the LDAP for device initialization
    and the RD for device discovery. Figure 9 shows the sequence diagram of messages
    for a device that comes online and connects to its gateway as part of the WSN—a
    subset of these messages holds for devices not part of a WSN. Figure 8 shows the
    corresponding high-level interactions. All IP-addressable devices in the deployment
    are considered as endpoints that contain resources that are logically grouped.
    These have to be autodiscovered based on minimal a priori information. Each device
    is assigned, and will be aware of, just a globally unique UUID and a “well known”
    LDAP URL. Separately, an administrator registers the UUID and its metadata for
    all devices that will be deployed on the field in the LDAP directory information
    tree (DIT). The DIT is organized by domain, location, sensor type, etc, to allow
    group updates ((1) in Figure 8). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sequence
    to bootstrap a device from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] When a device connects to the
    campus IoT network, it does an HTTP query by UUID to the LDAP service for its
    metadata. Constrained motes, instead, perform a CoAP GET on an LDAP lookup service
    running on the gateway Pi, whose IP address matches the border gateway of the
    WSN. The Pi lookup service translates this into an LDAP HTTP query (Figure 9;
    (2) in Figure 8). The response, optionally mapped from HTTP/LDIF to CoAP/JSON
    at the Pi, returns the entity type, its group(s), Distinguished Name (DN), spatial
    location, etc, and global URLs for the proxy services, RD, Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) broker, etc (Figure 9). We use a well-defined rule to generate
    unique URI paths for resources at this endpoint based on their metadata, which
    combines the spatial location, device and sensor type, and observation type, as
    shown below. After a device is bootstrapped, it needs to register the resources
    available at its endpoint (ep) with the RD so that users or machine-to-machine
    (M2M) clients can discover their existence. The RD uses the CoRE link format,33
    based on the HTTP Web Linking standard, for this resource metadata. Each CoRE
    link contains the URI of the resource, the optional endpoint hostname/IP:port,
    and the URI path, along with the resource type (rt), the interface type (if),
    and the maximum size (sz) of a GET response on this resource. Further, the RD
    also allows specifying the content type (ct) such as JSON, the groups (gp) the
    resource belongs to, and if the resource is observable (obs), ie, can be subscribed
    to for notifications.34 Lastly, we use the extensibility of CoRE links to include
    an MQTT topic (mt) parameter for observable resources, which will publish their
    state changes to this topic at a publish-subscribe broker (Section 15). Below
    is a sample CoRE link for an endpoint path ‘grid/43p/mote1/sensor2/waterlevel’
    with an observable ‘waterlevel’ resource from ‘sensor2’ that is attached to ‘mote1’
    placed at UTM grid location ‘43p’ and returning JSON content type (‘ct=50’). Figure
    10 shows the sequence of operations for the device to register its resource(s)
    with the RD. Note the use of the C2H and H2C proxies to translate from CoAP within
    campus to HTTP on the public Internet, and back to CoAP within the VM hosting
    the RD. Registrations with the RD should also include a lifetime (lt) for the
    entry in seconds, with the default being 24 hours. If the resource does not renew
    this within this lifetime, the RD removes this entry and the resources are presumed
    to be unavailable. Clients can browse the RD (Figure 11), or query it using its
    CoAP or HTTP REST proxy API to discover resources of interest, and subsequently
    interact with the resource endpoint using CoAP. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer

    ECE building. One Pi and three mote endpoints each have multiple resources [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 4.3 Monitoring and control We
    make use of service endpoints to monitor the health and manage the configuration
    of devices such as motes and gateways as well. All motes expose CoAP resources
    to monitor their telemetry such as battery voltage, link cost with parent, and
    frames dropped, whereas gateway Pis report their CPU, memory, and network usage
    statistics. These go beyond the liveliness that RD reports and are in real time.
    They help monitor the health of the network and device fabric and take preventive
    or corrective actions, for example, if a mote exhibits sustained packet drops
    or a Pi''s memory usage becomes high. While some issues may require personnel
    on the field to fix things, others may be resolved remotely using control endpoints,
    such as restarting a mote or changing the sampling interval to reduce battery
    usage cost or packet drops. The analytics platforms, introduced later, that support
    the domain applications are also leveraged for such decision-making to optimize
    the IoT infrastructure. 5 DATA ACQUISITION AND STORAGE One of the characteristics
    of IoT applications is the need to acquire data about the system in real time
    and make decisions. Given an operational IoT deployment and the ability to discover
    resources for observable and controllable devices, the next step is to acquire
    data about the utility infrastructure and preprocess and persist them for downstream
    analytics. Data acquisition from 100−1000′s of sensors has to happen at scale
    and with low latency and from constrained devices. Once acquired, these streams
    of observations have to be transformed and validated at fast rates to ensure data
    quality. We make a design choice to integrate all observation streams in the cloud
    to allow us to utilize scalable VMs and platform services and collocate real-time
    data with historic data in the data center on which analytics are performed. Next,
    we discuss our approach of using publish-subscribe mechanisms and fast data platforms
    for these needs. 5.1 Asynchronous access to publish-subscribe observations The
    transient nature of sensor resources and the diverse applications and clients
    that may be interested in their observations means that using a synchronous request-response
    model to poll the resource state will not scale. Further, the rate at which the
    observations change may be infrequent for many sensors (eg, the water level, or
    even battery level, gradually drains), and repetitive polling is inefficient.
    Rather, an asynchronous service invocation based on a subscription pattern is
    better suited. Here, the client registers interest in a resource and is notified
    when its state changes. We explore 2 mechanisms for such asynchronous observations
    of sensors, leveraging the native capabilities of CoAP and the scalable features
    of MQTT message brokers that are designed for IoT. 5.1.1 CoAP''s observe pattern
    CoAP services have an intrinsic ability to transmit data by subscription to clients
    interested in changes to the resource state.34 CoAP resources that indicate in
    their CoRE link format as being observable allow this capability, and it complements
    the request-response model. Clients (observers) can register interest in a resource
    (subject), and the service then notifies the client of their updated state when
    it changes. The resource can also be parameterized to offer flexibility in terms
    of what constitutes a “change,” for example, by passing a query that observes
    changes to a moving average of the resource''s state or when a certain time goes
    by since the last update. The service maintains a list of observers and notifies
    them of their state change but is designed to be eventually consistent rather
    than perfectly up to date. This ensures that the CoAP service is not frequently
    polled, making it amenable to the compute- and network-constrained environments
    like 6LoWPAN. All our motes expose this capability for their fabric resources
    and the sensor resources that they are connected to. This model, however, does
    have its limitations. It requires the service to maintain the list of observers,
    which can grow large and unmanageable for constrained devices. Further, this is
    a point-to-point model, and each observer has to be individually invoked to send
    the notification, duplicating the overhead. Also, current open-source software
    support for CoAP is limited to only resource state changes without any parameterization,
    though this is expected to change. 5.1.2 MQTT broker Publish-subscribe (or pub-sub)35
    is a messaging pattern that is asynchronous and uses a hub-and-spoke rather than
    point-to-point communication. Here, the source of the message ( publisher) is
    not directly accessed by the message consumer(s) (subscriber(s)). Instead, the
    messages are sent by the publisher(s) to an intermediate broker service, which
    forwards a copy of the message to interested subscribers. The message routing
    may be based on topics (like a shared mailbox) or the type or content of the message.
    The pub-sub pattern is highly scalable for IoT since the publishers and subscribers
    are agnostic to each other. This ensures loose coupling in the distributed environment
    while reducing their management overheads. Also, we drop from m×n messages set
    between m publishers and n subscribers to m+n messages, avoiding duplication.
    The publishers and subscribers can also be on different private networks and use
    the public broker for message exchange. We use the MQTT ISO standard that was
    developed as a lightweight pub-sub protocol for IoT.36 Publishers can publish
    messages to a topic in the broker, and subscribers can subscribe to one or more
    topics, including wildcards, to receive the messages. The topics have a hierarchical
    structure, allowing us to embed semantics into the topic names. Clients initiate
    the connection to the broker and keep it alive, allowing them to stay behind firewalls
    as long as the broker is accessible. The control payload is lightweight. The last
    published message to a topic may optionally be retained for future subscribers
    to access. It also supports a “last will and testament” message that is published
    to the will topic if the client connection is killed, letting subscribers know
    of departing publishers. Three different delivery QoS (and costs) are supported—at
    most once (best effort), at least once, and exactly once. We use the Apache Apollo
    MQTT broker implementation hosted in a VM in the cloud as part of our IoT platform
    stack. It supports client authentication and transport layer security. Topics
    are created for observable resources in the Smart Campus based on a production
    rule over the resource metadata, including the domain, spatial location, device
    and observation types, and the UUID for the device. This allows wildcard subscriptions,
    for example, to all waterlevel messages or all messages from the ECE building.
    The MQTT topic is present in the CoRE link registered with the RD, allowing the
    discovery and subscription to these topics. Nonconstrained devices like the Pi
    gateways and devices on the public network, such as the Android App, publish their
    resource state changes and observations to the MQTT broker. For reasons we shall
    explain next, constrained devices do not directly publish to the broker. We adopt
    IETF''s Sensor Markup Language (SenML) for publishing observations to topics.37
    This offers a self-descriptive format for time-series observations, single and
    multiple data points, delta values, simple aggregations like sum, and built-in
    SI units. It also has well-defined serializations to JSON, CBOR, XML and EXI.
    Clients interested in the real-time sensor streams, such as our data acquisition
    platform, Smart Campus portal (Figure 14), and the Smart Phone app, subscribe
    to these topics and can visualize or process the SenML observations. Figure 12
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sequence for data acquisition from sensors using
    Automated Observe and Publish. The gateway initiates a Constrained Application
    Protocol observe and autopublishes Sensor Markup Language values to Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Clients can subscribe to the MQTT topic [Colour figure
    can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 5.1.3 AOP from the gateway Publishing
    directly to the MQTT broker is still heavyweight for our constrained devices and
    WSN for several reasons: first is the overhead to initiate and keep the network
    connection open to the broker; second is the memory footprint for the MQTT client
    library on these embedded platforms, besides the CoAP service; and third is that
    our choice to publish SenML causes a payload much larger than the native observations.
    In order to offer the transparency of the pub-sub architecture while keeping with
    the limitations of the devices and the WSN, we develop an Automated Observe and
    Publish (AOP) service at the Pi gateway that couples the CoAP Observe capability
    with the MQTT publisher design. This is illustrated in Figure 8, and the sequence
    of operations is shown in Figure 12. This service on the Pi periodically queries
    the RD for new resources registered in the WSN group it belongs to ((4) in Figure
    8; Figure 12). If discovered, the AOP service registers an observe request with
    the service endpoint for all new resources ((5) in Figure 8). When the endpoint
    notifies the AOP of an updated resource state ((6) in Figure 8), AOP maps them
    to SenML/JSON and, as a data proxy, publishes them to the MQTT topic for that
    resource as listed in its CoRE link in the RD ((7) in Figure 8). Figure 13 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Interactions between streaming data acquisition and
    analytics dataflows in the data platform hosted on the cloud [Colour figure can
    be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] This design has the additional benefit of
    allowing clients that are interested in the observation to subscribe to the MQTT
    broker on the cloud VM rather than the CoAP service on the constrained device.
    Consumers in the private network that are latency sensitive can always use the
    CoAP observe feature, or poll the service directly, and avoid the round-trip time
    to the MQTT broker. For example, Figures 15A and 15B show the round-trip latency
    and the bandwidth of pairs of Pi''s within the campus backbone network, and between
    the Pi gateway devices on campus and the Azure VMs at Microsoft''s Singapore Cloud
    data center. These violin plot distributions are sampled over a 24-hour period
    and indicate the edge-to-edge and edge-to-cloud network profiles.38 We see substantial
    latency benefits in subscribing to the event streams from within the campus network,
    which has a median value of 10 ms (green bar), compared to 153 ms when publishing
    to the cloud. However, some regions of the campus have to go through multiple
    network switches, and their latencies approach that of moving to the cloud, as
    shown by the higher mean value (red bar). The bandwidth within campus is also
    50% faster and tighter, compared to between campus and cloud. Our IoT middleware
    offers multiple means of accessing the observation streams to allow applications
    to choose the most appropriate one based on their presence in the network topology.

    observations [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 5.2 Fast
    data processing and persistence Once data are published to the MQTT broker in
    the cloud, there is a multitude of big data platforms that can be leveraged for
    processing the sensor streams in the cloud data center. We take an approach similar
    to our earlier work,2 but with contemporary data platforms and updated domain
    logic relevant to the IISc Smart Campus. Data published to MQTT need to be subscribed
    to and persisted as, otherwise, these transient sensor streams are lost forever.
    At the same time, the data arriving from heterogeneous sensors have to be validated
    before they are used for analytics and decision-making, such as turning off pumps
    or notifying users of a water quality issue. Hence, the cleaned observations should
    be available with limited delay. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs)
    are big data platforms tailored for applications that need to process continuous
    data streams at high velocity within low latency on commodity cluster and cloud
    VMs.39 DSPSs allow users to compose persistent applications as a dataflow graph,
    where task vertices have user logic, and edges stream messages between the tasks.
    There are several contemporary DSPSs such as Apache Storm, Flink, Spark Streaming,
    Azure HDInsight, etc. We choose to use the Apache Storm DSPS40 from Twitter due
    to its maturity and active open-source support, as well as its ability to compose
    a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of modular user-defined tasks, rather than just
    higher-order primitives. Storm is used as our data acquisition platform for executing
    several streaming dataflow pipelines on sensor observations published to the MQTT
    broker (Figure 13). Two important and common classes of dataflows are Extract-Transform-Load
    (ETL) and Statistical Summarization (STATS).41 Figure 15 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint A, Network round-trip latency; B, network bandwidth distribution within
    campus edge local area network (E2E); from campus to cloud wide area network (E2C);
    C, Peak input stream rate on an Azure virtual machine41 supported for each Apache
    Storm distributed stream processing system task [Colour figure can be viewed at
    wileyonlinelibrary.com] The ETL pipeline helps address data format changes and
    quality issues before storing the observations. The input to ETL is by subscribing
    to wildcard topics in the MQTT broker by sensor type, which allows all observation
    types supported by this pipeline to be acquired. Care is taken to cover all relevant
    topics so that no observation stream is lost; alternatively, it can query the
    RD to subscribe to specific topics in the broker or use a special advertisement
    topic when new devices are on-boarded. The incoming messages may arrive from heterogeneous
    sources in different measurement units and formats, though SenML is preferred.
    Tasks like parsing and format and unit conversion help normalize these observations.
    There can also be missing or invalid values, for example, due to network packet
    drop or sensor error. For example, we see the water level sensor report incorrect
    depths due to perturbation in the water surface or sunlight reflecting into the
    ultrasonic detector. Range filters, smoothing, and interpolation tasks perform
    such basic validation, quality checks, and corrections. Lastly, the raw and validated
    data will need to be stored for future reference and batch analytics. We use the
    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store the raw observations from MQTT
    and the HBase NoSQL database42 to store the cleaned time-series data for batch
    analytics. The ETL dataflow also publishes the resulting cleaned sensor event
    stream to an MQTT topic, which then can be subscribed to by downstream applications.
    Basic statistical analyses are performed over the cleaned data to offer a summarized
    view of the state of the IoT system. These are used for monitoring the domain
    or the IoT fabric, information dissemination across campus users, or for human
    decision-making. The STATS streaming dataflow (Figure 13) performs operations
    like statistical aggregation, moving window averages, probability distributions,
    and basic plotting using libraries like XChart. Our STATS pipeline subscribes
    to the MQTT topic to which ETL publishes the cleaned observation streams. The
    statistical aggregates generated by STATS are likewise published to MQTT from
    which, for example, the portal can plot real-time visualizations like Figure 14,
    whereas the plotted files are pushed to file store, which can then be embedded
    in static webpages or reports. Earlier, we have developed the RIoTBench benchmark
    that has composable IoT logic blocks and generic IoT dataflows that are used for
    evaluating DSPS platforms.41 We customize and configure these dataflow pipelines
    for the Smart Campus and the water management domain. As a validation of the scalability
    of the proposed solution, we have shown that Apache Storm can support event rates
    of over 1000/sec for many classes of tasks, as illustrated in Figure 15C, when
    operating on an Azure cloud VM. The tasks that were benchmarked span different
    IoT business logic categories such as parsing sensor payloads, filtering and quality
    checks, statistical and predictive analytics, and cloud I/O operations. These
    are then assembled together and customized for the domain processing analytics,
    such as smart water management. While we use Storm as our preferred DSPS in our
    software stack, it can be transparently replaced by any other DSPS that can compose
    these dataflow pipelines. The tasks we leverage from RIoTBench are designed as
    Java libraries, and hence, many stream processing systems can incorporate them
    directly for modular composition. Since the interaction between these pipelines
    is through the MQTT pub-sub broker, it offers loose coupling between the dataflows
    and the platform components. In fact, multiple DSPSs can coexist if need be, for
    example, to support higher-order queries using Spark or a lambda architecture
    over streaming and static data using Flink. Even our Apollo MQTT broker can be
    replaced by cloud-based pub-sub platforms like Azure IoT Hub that uses the MQTT
    protocol. Likewise, our choice of HBase can be replaced by other NoSQL platforms
    or cloud storage like Azure Tables as well. As we note next in Section 20, the
    HDFS or NoSQL store plays a similar role of loose coupling between big data batch
    processing platforms that need to operate on archived data. 6 DATA ANALYTICS AND
    DECISION-MAKING There are several types of analytics that can help with manual
    and automated decision-making about the water domain, and the IoT fabric management
    as well. Similar to the stream processing pipelines for data acquisition above,
    streaming dataflows can perform analytics and decision-making as well. Figure
    13 shows such online analytics and decision-making pipeline (DECIDE) that consumes
    cleaned observation streams from MQTT and can perform time-series analysis using
    autoregressive models for, say, water demand prediction. Feature-based analytics,
    such as a decision tree, can be embedded to correlate environmental observations
    with specific outcomes, such as days of the week with the water footprint in buildings.
    The Figure also shows how such predictive models can be trained using streaming
    or batch dataflows from historic data (TRAIN), and the updated models feed into
    the online predictions, periodically. We use logic blocks from the Weka library43
    within the Apache Storm dataflow for such online predictive analytics, and several
    are made available as part of RIoTBench. One of the most intuitive analytics for
    utility management is through the detection of event patterns. Complex event processing
    (CEP) enables a form of reactive analytics by allowing us to specify patterns
    over event streams and identify situations of interest.44 It uses a query model
    similar to SQL that executes continuously over the event stream and specifically
    allows window aggregations and sequence matching. The former applies an aggregation
    function over count or time windows, in a batch or sliding manner, whereas the
    latter allows a sequence of events matching specific predicates to be detected.
    For example, these queries can detect when the moving average of water pressure
    goes above a certain threshold or when the water level in a tank drops by >5%
    over successive events spread over 10 minutes. The former may indicate a blockage
    in the water distribution network, whereas the latter may identify rapid water
    leakage in building.45 We use WSO2 Siddhi46 as our CEP engine for such “fast data”
    event analytics and validate its scalability both on gateway devices such as a
    Raspberry Pi 2 for edge computing as well as on an Azure VM for cloud computing.38
    Figure 16 shows prior results for 21 representative queries that perform sequence
    and pattern matching, filtering and aggregation, etc, over water level streams
    on the Pi. As we can see, these event queries are lightweight and can support
    rates of over 25 000 events/s even on a Pi, with the corresponding Azure benchmarks
    showing a 3× improvement (Figures 16A and 16B). We can also infer the per-event
    query latency from these peak throughputs (Figures 16C and 16D), and most execute
    in ≤0.04 ms on the Pi and in ≤0.005 ms on the cloud. There is limited variability
    in the execution latency or the throughput. While the execution on the cloud is
    much faster, when coupled with the edge-to-cloud latency for transferring the
    event from a sensor on campus to the cloud (Figure 15A), execution on the Pi has
    a lower makespan. These validate the use of event analytics for both edge and
    cloud computing. Figure 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Peak throughput and

    patterns, etc, that can then be used by humans to manually take decisions or for
    rule-based systems to automatically enact controls. These actions can include
    automatically turning water pumps on and off based on the water level, notifying
    users of contamination in a spatial water network region, reporting leaking pipes
    and taps to maintenance crew, etc. These strategies are currently being investigated
    as a meaningful corpus of water distribution and usage data within the campus
    is accumulated. Computational and network models that leverage these sensed data
    are being developed by our collaborators as well.47 In addition, these data streams
    and analytics help more immediately with understanding and managing the IoT fabric,
    particularly during the development and deployment phase of the infrastructure.
    They help identify, for example, when the WSN is unable to form a tree or has
    high packet drops, when the sensors and motes are going to drain their battery,
    or when gateways go offline (eg, due to wild monkeys fiddling with the devices,
    as we have seen!). It also helps validate the performance of network algorithms
    like RPL and build a repository of network signal strengths at different parts
    of the campus, over time. Often, these exploratory analyses are performed on historic
    data collected over days and months within our data platform. We leverage the
    Apache Spark48 distributed data processing engine for such batch analytics. Spark
    allows fast, in-memory iterative computations and has been shown to outperform
    traditional Hadoop MapReduce platforms. It also offers intuitive programming models
    such as SparkQL for easy specification of analytics requirements. Spark uses HBase,
    where we archive the cleansed sensor data, as its distributed data source. It
    can also be used to train predictive models in batch using its machine learning
    libraries. While we currently perform periodic model training using a Storm dataflow
    for convenience (TRAIN in Figure 13), we propose to switch to Spark in the near
    future. We expose a Batch Analytics REST Service wrapper around Spark to ease
    the execution of simple analytics from the Smart Campus web portal. This allows
    temporal and sensor-based filtering as well as aggregation and transformation
    operations over the observational data sets to be mapped as parameterized Spark
    jobs that run on cloud VMs. The Spark jobs can run for several minutes to hours,
    depending on the complexity of the analysis and source data size, and generate
    kilobytes to gigabytes of data. Hence, a synchronous REST call from the portal
    will timeout. Instead, we define an asynchronous service pattern based on the
    existing architectural components, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 17 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Workflow for asynchronous batch analytics service [Colour figure
    can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] When the user submits an analytics query
    from their browser, the REST service first creates a unique MQTT topic for this
    session and then invokes a Spark job by populating its parameters, including this
    topic. The REST service returns this topic to the browser, which subscribes to
    the topic with the broker. The Spark engine fetches the source data from HBase,
    runs the analysis, and writes the output to a cloud file storage. It then publishes
    the URL of this result file to the unique topic in the broker. The browser gets
    notified of this URL and can use it to either stream and visualize the results
    or allow the user to download it. This exhibits the flexibility of our SOA to
    easily compose complex data management and analytics operations. In the future,
    this REST API and asynchronous execution pattern can be easily extended to allow
    ad hoc Spark SQL queries to be directly submitted for execution. This will allow
    developers to construct more powerful exploratory analytics, besides the user-oriented
    query template that is currently supported. Lastly, we also support several types
    of visual analytics that are exposed through the Smart Campus portal. The portal
    itself was developed as part of this project and includes a dashboard for displaying
    real-time and temporal analytics (Figure 14) using JavaScript plugins like D3.js
    and Rickshaw and multilayered geospatial visualizations of the IoT network on
    the IISc campus using Open Street Maps (Figure 18). These leverage the self-describing
    SenML format used by the sensors for publishing observation streams, allowing
    plots to be automatically formatted for arbitrary sensors. These help with information
    dissemination to the end users on campus, as well as simple visualization for
    resource managers. The portal also serves as a way for the campus managers to
    monitor the state of the IoT infrastructure using the RD and potentially initiate
    actuation signals for enactment. Figure 18 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Geospatial
    visualization of Smart Campus water infrastructure, motes, and sensors [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] As before, for the choice DSPS,
    we can also replace Siddhi with other CEP engines like Apache Edgent and Spark
    with platforms like Apache Pig or Hadoop. Our architectural design is agnostic
    to the specific platform, and the presence of pub-sub brokers and NoSQL data stores
    enable loose coupling between diverse platforms that interface through them. Our
    selection of these specific platforms is indicative of what is adequate for the
    needs of the Smart Campus and bounded by the scalability experiments that we have
    performed and reported. Other deployments may pick contemporary alternatives that
    are appropriate for their needs. 7 RELATED WORK There has been heightened interest
    recently in designing software fabrics and data platforms to manage IoT infrastructure,
    and data and applications within them, with even a special issue dedicated to
    such software systems.49 These are emerging from standards bodies (IETF CoRE,
    W3C Web of Things, ITU-T, ISO), industry and consortia (Azure IoT, AWS Greengrass,
    Threads Group, OneM2M, AllSeen Alliance, FIWARE, LoRa), and academia (IERC, IoT-A,
    OpenIoT), with implementations by the open-source community (Californium, Kura,
    Sentilo, Kaa). While some of these, like MQTT, have gained traction, others are
    competing for mind-share and market share. However, we are at an early evolutionary
    stage, and there is a lack of clarity on what would be the most suitable technical
    solutions and what would gain popular acceptance (these being 2 different factors).
    In this context, having a practical implementation and validation of an integrated
    IoT architecture on the field using these functional designs and protocols, as
    we have presented in this article, will better inform these conceptual exercises
    and reference designs. While we make specific service-oriented design, protocol,
    and implementation choices for the Smart Campus project, driven by smart utility
    needs in India, there are other numerous relevant efforts and alternatives, and
    we discuss a representative sample here. 7.1 Community specifications The concept
    of a Web of Things (WoT) was proposed several years back by W3C but did not translate
    to proactive standardization efforts like IETF''s.50 Recently, the W3C WoT working
    group has begun developing a formal WoT architecture for IoT.51 It leverages simplified
    forms of Web standards like HTTP, REST, and JSON to support use cases on Smart
    Homes, Smart Factory, and Connected Cars. In this evolving draft, device, gateway
    (edge), and cloud are seen as first-class building blocks, similar to our own
    differentiation, and supported environments include browser, smart phones, edge
    hubs, and cloud VMs. They also propose a servient software stack to design and
    deploy applications built using a scripting framework and protocol bindings to
    more popular IoT standards such as MQTT and CoAP. These bindings ensure that our
    own design that leverages existing standards is likely to be able to interface
    with a WoT stack in the future. The COMPOSE API for IoT52 takes a similar WoT
    view and defines REST operations and JSON payloads on Service Objects that wrap
    physical things. Applications can be composed across multiple physical devices
    using these APIs. While these are still early days for WoT, it is likely to find
    wider industry support given the past history of W3C standards. OneM2M is a broad-based
    effort to develop open specifications for a horizontal IoT middleware that will
    enable interoperability for M2M communications. It proposes comprehensive service
    specifications for device identification, RESTful resource and container management,
    and synchronous and asynchronous information flows, with mappings to open protocols
    like CoAP, MQTT, and HTTP.53 This is targeted at large-sale IoT deployments with
    complex devices and use cases and multiple vendors. This effort is driven by major
    telecom providers and government agencies such as the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology and India''s Department of Telecommunication and is expected to
    gain traction once the standards are formalized. Our goal in this article is much
    more modest, and we validate a slice of these complex interactions within the
    campus-scale IoT deployment, using similar functional layers and open protocols.
    7.2 Open-source efforts FIWARE54  3is an open IoT software standard and a platform
    that is gaining recent attention and whose features overlap with our middleware
    requirements. Like us, it uses MQTT and CoAP protocols for accessing observations
    that are coordinated through a context broker, supports CEP processing using IBM
    PROTON for alerts, and uses HDFS and Hive for archival storage and querying. It
    pays particular attention to capturing the device context, data models, dashboarding,
    and security, making it a holistic solution. However, our proposed architecture
    pushes this abstraction down to the network layer, with patterns for capturing
    data across public and private networks and across embedded and gateway devices,
    as discussed in Section 14. We also place emphasis on the postprocessing of captured
    event streams by DSPS to make them ready for analytics. These are practical needs
    from the field. That said, FIWARE can be used as a base implementation that is
    complemented with these mechanisms we propose. WSO2 has proposed a reference architecture
    for an IoT platform, much like IoT-A, as a starting point for software architects.55
    However, they focus primarily on the data and analytics platform rather than on
    the networking and fabric management, which are essential on the field. They too
    leverage CoAP, MQTT, and HTTP for communications but, unlike us, abstract away
    device and communication concerns. They have their custom device management interface,
    targeted more at smart phones, and identity management for users using LDAP. They
    offer an open implementation of their WSO2 IoT software stack that supports MQTT
    message brokering, event analytics using Siddhi engine (which we also use), and
    enterprise dashboarding. Commercial software support is also offered. Sentilo56  4
    is an open-source platform for managing sensors and actuators in a smart city
    environment, supported by the Barcelona City Council. In their stack, devices
    need to be added to a catalog using a dashboard and a predefined data model to
    get an authentication token. Registered devices can then use their token to publish
    data and alerts to a Redis in-memory data store, which also has a pub-sub interface.
    Applications can register for these alerts and data changes and perform actions,
    but data preprocessing and analytics platforms or their application logic are
    explicitly proposed. They also make no distinction between registered and online
    resources, unlike our LDAP and RD, and this makes it difficult to know the state
    of the devices without querying. They offer protocol adapters for SCADA and smart
    meters, but their design is not inherently suited for constrained devices. While
    it has similar architectural goals and functional elements as our design, it is
    not as grounded in standard compliance and interoperability other than using RESTful
    APIs. However, they have deployed the stack at multiple city locations, giving
    it practical validation. 7.3 Research activities There are multiple efforts in
    the European Union (EU) on defining reference models for IoT, including IERC and
    AIOTI. Internet-of-things Architecture (IoT-A) is one such EU FP7 project that
    proposes an application-independent model that can then be mapped to a concrete
    architecture and platform-specific implementation.57 They offer a comprehensive
    survey of design requirements, and their reference architecture spans the device,
    communication, IoT service, virtual entity, and business process layers, with
    service management and security serving as orthogonal layers. They also have a
    structured information model. This has a close correlation with our functional
    model, with device shadows (virtual entities) and security being gaps we need
    to address in the future. Further, rather than stop at a functional design, we
    also make specific platform and protocol choices for these functional entities
    and deploy it in practice within the IISc campus. One of the key challenges of
    IoT networks and platforms is the plethora of coexisting and overlapping standards
    and the need to interface across them. Aloi et al58 highlight the need to operate
    over diverse communication technologies and network protocols as requirements
    for opportunistic IoT scenarios. Specifically, they examine the use of smart phones
    as mobile gateways to act as a bridge between communication protocols like ZigBee,
    Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G. This abstracts the data access by the applications
    and user interface from the underlying technologies. Such a model is well suited
    for generalizing our crowdsourced data collection using mobile apps and offers
    a parallel with the sensor data management in our Pi gateways. Yet another dimension
    of large-scale IoT deployments is the ability to plan the deployment ahead of
    time and with limited field explorations. Here, modeling and simulation environments
    are useful design tools.59 While our SmartConnect tool23 helps with WSN design
    planning, more comprehensive tools exist to allow one to span sensing, networking,
    device management, and data management design within the IoT ecosystem.60 Large-scale
    deployments will benefit from mapping the proposed solutions to such simulation
    environments to evaluate specific technologies. A recent special journal issue
    focused on software systems to manage smart city applications that deal with large
    data sets.49 However, these articles fail to take a holistic view of the entire
    software stack and limited themselves to specific big data platforms such as Spark
    or analytics techniques like support vector machines. We instead investigate the
    fundamental software architecture design to support a wide variety of domain applications
    and analytics techniques. 7.4 Smart city deployments In this regard, other EU
    projects like OpenIoT translate the IERC reference architecture into practical
    implementations.61 However, they do not pay adequate attention to protocol choices
    for constrained devices and compatibility with emerging standards like CoRE and
    offer just a proof-of-concept validation. The Ahab framework goes further by examining
    the analytics stack that is necessitated by the use of both streaming and static
    smart city data through a lambda architecture.62 However, key aspects such as
    interaction models for device and sensor registration and the impact of network
    protocols are not considered. The SmartSantander testbed is one of the more progressive
    smart city deployments, and it offers insights on traffic and human mobility from
    Spain.63, 64 They offer their design requirements and a software architecture
    for managing the testbed. This includes gateway and server runtimes, registry
    services, and resource management. Authentication, authorization, and accounting
    (AAA) services as well as sensor, actuator, and application deployment through
    a service interface are provided as well. They offer examples of the potential
    data sources and analytics, such as environment monitoring, landscape irrigation,
    and traffic and parking management. Many of our requirements and architectural
    design exhibit similarities. 8 CONCLUSION In this article, we have set out the
    design goals for an IoT fabric and data management platform in the context of
    smart utilities, with the IISc campus serving as a testbed for validation and
    smart water management being the motivating domain. Our functional architecture
    is similar to other IoT reference models, with layers for communication, data
    acquisition, analytics and decision-making, and resource and device management.
    We also make specific protocol and software platform choices that advance a data-driven,
    service-oriented design that integrates big data platforms and edge and cloud
    computing. We also identify interaction patterns for the integrated usage of these
    disparate standards, protocols, and services that are evolving independently.
    At the same time, our design is generic to support other domains such as smart
    power grids or intelligent transportation, and such a translation is underway
    as part of a “lightpole computing” effort within the Bangalore city.65 The experiences
    from the project will help in understanding the distinctive needs of smart city
    utilities in developing countries like India. Our performance results for the
    network design, as well as the cloud-based stream preprocessing using Storm and
    edge-based event analytics using Siddhi validate the scalability of the software
    stack at the IISc campus. In particular, the platform is shown to scale to thousands
    of events per second for real IoT application logic on single VMs and Pi devices.
    These are inherently designed to weakly scale, thus allowing these rates supported
    to further increase for citywide deployments by adding more VMs and edge devices.
    The software stack also is available online as an open-source contribution, allowing
    the open architecture design and implementation to be replicated at other campuses
    and communities as well. Having a service API and standards-based IoT middleware
    enables the rapid development of novel and practical applications, both for our
    intended goal of smart water management and beyond. Some such applications include
    mobile apps for crowdsourced water quality reporting and user notification, with
    linkages to trouble-ticket management by the campus maintenance crew. These data
    sources are also helping with water balance study and leak detection applications
    within campus, such as ones done by our collaborators.47, 66 The key distinction
    is the ability to perform such studies on-demand and incorporate outcomes in real
    time, rather than require custom time-consuming field experiments, as was the
    norm. This accelerates the translation of science into operational benefits. Further,
    the same IoT stack was used for crowdsourced collection of WiFi signal strengths
    for use by the campus Information Technology team and for an IoT Summer School
    hackathon, as part of campus outreach programs.67 The initial field trials using
    hundreds of sensors and devices are underway across campus. However, to ensure
    that the scope of the project was kept manageable, several additional aspects
    were deferred for future exploration. Key among them are security and policy frameworks
    that are essential in a public utility infrastructure.68 Several authentication
    and authorization standards already exist for the Web, with billions of mobile
    devices and Web applications utilizing them. Utilities, however, have a higher
    threat perception, and end-to-end security mechanisms will need to be enforced.
    Similarly, auditing and provenance will be essential to identify the operational
    decision-making chain, especially with automation of mission-critical systems.69
    Trust mechanisms have to be established for using crowdsourced data for operations,
    and privacy within pervasive sensing is a concern. From a platform perspective,
    we are also investigating the use of edge and fog devices to complement a cloud-centric
    data platform.12, 38, 70 Energy-aware computing and mobility of devices also needs
    attention. These will find place in our future work. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work

    \ are\nusually geographically separated. In this sense, the use of enabling technologies\
    \ such as the Internet\nof Things can be essential to the proper operation of\
    \ these agroindustrial systems. In this paper, an\nInternet of Things cloud architecture\
    \ based on the FIWARE standard is proposed for interconnecting\nthe several agents\
    \ that make up the agroindustrial system. In addition, this architecture includes\n\
    an efﬁcient management method based on a model predictive control technique, which\
    \ is aimed at\nminimizing operating costs. A case study inspired by three real\
    \ facilities located in Almería (southeast\nof Spain) is used as the simulation\
    \ test bed. The obtained results show how around 75% of the total\noperating costs\
    \ can be saved with the application of the proposed approach, which could be very\n\
    signiﬁcant to decrease the costs of desalinated water and, therefore, to maintain\
    \ the sustainability of\nthe agricultural system.\nKeywords: FIWARE; cloud storage;\

    Almería (southeast of Spain) is one of the driest regions in Europe, but paradoxically,\
    \ it has one\nof the continent’s largest agricultural production systems. Such\
    \ a system is composed of more than\n30,000 ha of effective greenhouse production\
    \ [1], and it has become the main driving force of the\neconomy of this dry region.\
    \ One basic ingredient of this system is fresh water, so that the development\n\
    of agriculture in Almería has been associated for many years with the decline\
    \ of fresh water reservoirs,\ndespite being the agricultural area where the most\
    \ efﬁcient management of this resource is carried\nout [2]. This encouraged the\
    \ installation of desalination plants as a tool to maintain the fresh water\n\
    availability in the region and,therefore, the sustainability of the agricultural\
    \ system [3]. Thus, Almería’s\ncurrent agricultural water panorama comprises consumer\
    \ agents, as greenhouses and industries related\nto agriculture, and producer\
    \ agents based on conventional (water public utility network and wells)\nSensors\

    \ 2020, 20, 596\n2 of 21\nand non-conventional sources (desalination facilities).\
    \ This agroindustrial environment constitutes a\ndistributed water network that\
    \ requires an integral smart management method for its optimal use [4].\nSeveral\
    \ management strategies have been formulated in the literature for distributed\
    \ water\nnetworks, especially focused on the urban water cycle of Barcelona (Spain).\
    \ In the work of Ocampo\nMartinez et al. [5], Model Predictive Control (MPC) paradigms\
    \ were proposed aimed at reducing\npumping costs. An operational MPC approach\
    \ was proposed by Pascual et al. [6], tasked with reducing\ncosts, as well as\
    \ maintaining safety storage volumes in the buffer tanks. Another control based\
    \ water\nmanagement system was proposed by Lopez Farias et al. [7]. In this case,\
    \ the forecasting accuracy\nof the control system was improved by means of a qualitative\
    \ multi-model predictor. Although all\nthese works proposed effective management\
    \ methods, they did not describe the way in which all the\ninformation coming\
    \ from the different devices of the distributed network is integrated and uniﬁed\
    \ for\nthe application of the methods in real cases. In addition, they are focused\
    \ on optimizing the transport\nwater network, without taking into account the\
    \ optimal management of the water sources.\nTo manage the water sources optimally,\
    \ it is essential to adapt the production to the demand.\nThis fact is especially\
    \ signiﬁcant when considering desalination facilities in the water network\n(as\
    \ happens in Almería) as the costs associated with the production of desalinated\
    \ water are still\nrelatively high [8], and they depend directly on production.\
    \ The work presented by Roca et al. [9]\ndemonstrated how a desalination facility\
    \ can be efﬁciently coupled to a greenhouse by using MPC\ntechniques. Moreover,\
    \ the work in [10] showed how metrics related to the desalination process\ncan\
    \ be improved in these kinds of combinations by using advanced control strategies.\
    \ However,\nthese works were focused only on the management method, considering\
    \ desalination as the only\nwater source, and without taking into account costs\
    \ in the management problem.\nAs stated\nin [11], to minimize the operational\
    \ costs of desalination facilities and to improve their efﬁciency,\na bi-directional\
    \ communication between them and the consumers must be established, which can\n\
    be achieved by means of adequate Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)\
    \ tools. This\nis especially relevant in Almería, where there are relatively small\
    \ and geographically dispersed\ngreenhouse cultivation areas that depend on the\
    \ water coming from one or several desalination plants.\nThese plants need to\
    \ know the water demand of each greenhouse for their efﬁcient use in terms of\n\
    operating costs. One natural choice to solve the problem is the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) framework,\nas it allows connecting all the devices in a uniﬁed platform\
    \ regardless of their geographical location.\nIn addition, IoT can be associated\
    \ with data analytics and cloud computing, thus making powerful\nplatforms that\
    \ allow gathering the required information from different IoT devices, analyzing\
    \ it\nin the cloud, and transmitting the corresponding control signals to the\
    \ actuators of the distributed\nnetwork. These features have made IoT a key component\
    \ in the development of sustainable distributed\nenvironments [12,13].\nIn recent\
    \ years, IoT has experienced a breakthrough, changing the way in which providers\
    \ and\nconsumers interact with each other. Agriculture is not alien to this transition,\
    \ and it is experiencing a\nchange of the business model in the technological\
    \ ﬁeld [14,15] according to which customers (farmers)\nare ceasing to acquire\
    \ assets (monitoring computers, sensors, or control systems) while demanding\n\
    services [16,17]. In this framework, the supplier companies are responsible for\
    \ ensuring the proper\nfunctioning of their equipment and providing the data necessary\
    \ for farmers to make their decisions,\nbilling for such services. The devices,\
    \ through the change of ﬁrmware, can dynamically change the\nactivities they carry\
    \ out, supplying information to the cloud (not only locally as is usually done)\
    \ [18]\nand, through the adequate processing of this information, help to reduce\
    \ service times and operation\nshutdowns. This paradigm shift requires the establishment\
    \ of transversal protocols, interoperability,\nand collaboration between companies\
    \ and services.\nNevertheless, the arrival of IoT to the agricultural ﬁeld not\
    \ only has inﬂuenced the relationships\nbetween costumers and companies, but also\
    \ the way in which the agricultural activities are developed.\nThus, the term\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA) has emerged [19,20], which involves the use of a\
    \ series of\nsensors and actuators that allow gathering context information of\
    \ the environment that surrounds\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n3 of 21\nthem. This paradigm\
    \ enables the development of tools to assist in decision-making, monitoring\n\
    activities in the crop, and applications to improve the quality; all of them aimed\
    \ at obtaining a more\nefﬁcient and sustainable agricultural system [21–24]. In\
    \ this way, different agronomic data management\nplatforms using IoT technologies\
    \ are being developed, often driven by European Union initiatives.\nThese platforms\
    \ are a natural evolution of the so-called farm management systems to make them\n\
    compatible with cloud computing [19,21,25]. FIWARE is an initiative of the European\
    \ Union for the\ncreation of a platform that helps the development of applications\
    \ and solutions focused on the IoT [26].\nFIWARE aims to create an open and sustainable\
    \ ecosystem, based on public software standards.\nMoreover, regarding water management\
    \ in crops, which is the scope of this work, several\napproaches have been proposed\
    \ in literature making a proper use of IoT technology for developing\nsmart irrigation\
    \ systems, some of them based on the use of FIWARE as well. In [27], an IoT system\
    \ for\nsmart energy consumption and irrigation was presented. The system decides\
    \ the amount of water\nrequired by the crops according to the current moisture\
    \ in soil and humidity (measured by mean\nof IoT sensors) and the time of the\
    \ day. A similar approach was proposed in [28], but in this case,\nmeteorological\
    \ data were also considered to predict the water requirements based on a machine\n\
    learning system. The most complete approach was the one proposed in [29], in which\
    \ an IoT platform\nbased on FIWARE was proposed for smart water management in\
    \ agriculture taking into account water\nreserve, water distribution, and water\
    \ consumption. However, all these works were mainly focused\non the management\
    \ of irrigation and on the distribution system considering only the public utility\n\
    water network as the water source.\nIn this way, the\nmain gaps observed in the\
    \ literature according to the above review are the\nfollowing ones:\n•\nThe management\
    \ methods presented for distributed water networks so far only addressed\nthe\
    \ optimization of the transport water network, without taking into account water\
    \ sources.\nBesides, they did not establish the way in which the different agents\
    \ of the distributed network\nwere interconnected.\n•\nThe works addressing the\
    \ connection of non-conventional water sources as desalination facilities\nand\
    \ consumer agents were focused on the optimal management of the desalination facilities,\n\
    without considering other water sources in the problem. In addition, they were\
    \ aimed at\nimproving metrics related to the desalination process, but not to\
    \ minimizing economic costs,\nwhich is very relevant for the correct implementation\
    \ of this type of framework. Furthermore,\nthey did not describe the way in which\
    \ the agents are interconnected.\n•\nThe works related to enabling technologies\
    \ such as IoT in the agricultural ﬁeld were focused\non improving the crops’ performance,\
    \ addressing aspects like the optimization of the irrigation\nsystem, or the development\
    \ of platforms to improve the decision making. However, to the authors’\nknowledge,\
    \ there are no works that discuss the use of these kinds of technologies for the\
    \ effective\nmanagement of agroindustrial districts in terms of water, which can\
    \ be essential to optimize the\nperformance of the new panorama that arises with\
    \ the introduction of new water sources in the\nagricultural ecosystem.\nTo address\
    \ the aforementioned issues, this work presents an IoT platform for the optimal\n\
    management of the distributed water network of agroindustrial environments. The\
    \ contributions\nof the work are three fold. First, a scalable IoT platform for\
    \ the interconnection of the different\nagents composing the distributed water\
    \ network is proposed. The IoT platform is based on FIWARE,\nand the architecture\
    \ is fragmented into layers or services. Second, the IoT platform incorporates\
    \ an\nMPC strategy tasked with optimizing the operational costs of the water network,\
    \ taking into account\nthe costs of the feed pump of the desalination facility\
    \ and the costs of the water coming from the\npublic utility network, while ensuring\
    \ the water needs. Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach,\
    \ a case study based on three real plants located in Almería is used to carry\
    \ out\nexhaustive simulation tests with non-optimal management methods.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 596\n4 of 21\nThe reminder of the document is organized as follows:\
    \ Section 2 is dedicated to depicting the\nconcept and problems of agroindustrial\
    \ districts. Section 3 is aimed at presenting the basis of the\nproposed IoT platform,\
    \ a general overview of it, and the description of the practical case study adopted.\n\
    Section 4 presents and discusses the simulation results. Section 5 summarizes\
    \ the conclusions obtained\nfrom the results and possible future work.\n2. Agroindustrial\
    \ District: Deﬁnition and Problems\nBefore presenting the IoT architecture, it\
    \ is essential to deﬁne the agroindustrial district concept\nand the problems\
    \ associated with this kind of system. The contemporary industrial district theory\
    \ is\nowed to Giacomo Beccattini [30], who deﬁned it as a territorial-partner\
    \ entity characterized by the\nactive presence of a community of people and a\
    \ population of companies in a given geographical\nand historical space. Following\
    \ this proposal, the term agroindustrial district was introduced as a\ndistrict\
    \ constituted by farms, processing companies, and supply companies located in\
    \ a given territory.\nThis environment is usually dominated by small and medium\
    \ enterprises, specialized in one of\nthe phases of the production chain. Among\
    \ them, there are important relationships of the vertical\ntype (between companies\
    \ of different phases of the production process) and of the horizontal type\n\
    (between companies of the same phase) or transversal (with supply and service\
    \ companies).\nIn this synergy framework, there are systems with different objectives\
    \ that depend on the needs\nof heterogeneous resources, both energy (electricity\
    \ and heat/cold) and others (such as water and\nCO2). In addition, if renewable\
    \ energy is included in this environment, it is necessary to manage\nconveniently\
    \ the efﬁcient use of all resources in each of the systems, as well as coordinate\
    \ the ﬂow\nbetween them. The research project Control and Optimal Management of\
    \ Heterogeneous Resources\nin Agroindustrial production districts integrating\
    \ renewable Energies (CHROMAE) (www2.ual.es/\nchromae), funded by the Spanish\
    \ Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and ERDF\nfunds, is aimed\
    \ at developing comprehensive, coordinated, and optimal management strategies\n\
    for the heterogeneous resources required by the elements that make up an agroindustrial\
    \ district.\nThe different agents, resources, and interlinks considered in the\
    \ CHROMAE project can by found at\n(www2.ual.es/chromae).\nAlthough the present\
    \ work is based on this project, it particularizes only the production phase of\n\
    the agroindustrial sector, the most extended case in Almería. In this phase, the\
    \ challenge was directly\nrelated to the optimal and efﬁcient management of water,\
    \ essential for crops. This resource must be\nmanaged, establishing as a main\
    \ premise that the result of such optimal management produces an as\nsmall as\
    \ possible environmental impact. Moreover, economic criteria must also be taken\
    \ into account\nin the management problem. Another fact to consider and that should\
    \ be added to the problem\nis that the different elements of the district are\
    \ usually geographically separated. This requires the\nuse of enabling technologies\
    \ (such as IoT) to close the circle, interconnect different systems, and to\n\
    manage all of them centrally.\n3. The IoT Platform: Basis, Overview and Case Study\
    \ Description\nThis section presents the main components of the IoT architecture\
    \ developed for the optimal\nmanagement of an agroindustrial district, as well\
    \ as a general description of it and its application in a\ncase study in Almería.\
    \ In this way, the FIWARE platform and the MPC technique are ﬁrstly depicted.\n\
    Then, an overview of the proposed platform is shown and described, and ﬁnally,\
    \ the case study in\nAlmería is developed.\n3.1. FIWARE\nFIWARE [26] is an IoT\
    \ platform driven by the European Union. FIWARE presents a modular\narchitecture\
    \ based on open source components trying to form an open and sustainable ecosystem\n\
    with the capacity to be adapted to different environments. This platform provides\
    \ cloud capabilities\nbased on OpenStack [31] including a series of libraries\
    \ and tools known as Generic Enablers (GEs) [32],\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n5 of\
    \ 21\nwhich facilitate the creation of applications and services in IoT. These\
    \ GEs offer Representational State\nTransfer (REST) and an Application Programming\
    \ Interface (API) with public and free speciﬁcations,\nwhich allow the integration\
    \ of third party software services, leading to an acceleration in the\ndevelopment\
    \ of intelligent solutions, including data analysis and processing, persistence,\
    \ and language\ninterpreters, among others. The GEs are based on APIs that implement\
    \ the Open Mobile Alliance\n(OMA) and Next-Generation Services Interface (NGSI)\
    \ standards [33].\nFIWARE is trying to promote a new standard for IoT. The main\
    \ core of FIWARE, and mandatory\nfor its use, is the enabler called the Orion\
    \ Context Broker (OCB), which is responsible for managing\ncontext information.\
    \ In this sense, context refers to the entire environment surrounding the IoT\
    \ system,\nwhich is capable of producing relevant information for the development\
    \ of the system. This context\ninformation is generated by different data sources\
    \ such as a network of sensors, existing third party\napplications, actuators,\
    \ and other devices. The following points describe some of the most important\n\
    GEs of FIWARE [32]:\n1.\nOCB: It is the intermediary between producers (publishers)\
    \ and consumers (subscribers).\nThe NGSI interface is a RESTful APIs service,\
    \ which allows queries on the status of context\ninformation. This allows creating\
    \ as many entities as sensors or set of sensors available in the\nsystem, allowing\
    \ collecting information in real time.\n2.\nCygnus: It is the GE in charge of\
    \ persisting context information, and it is based on Apache Flume.\nCygnus allows\
    \ making a copy of the data simultaneously in different databases that include:\n\
    MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Big Data platforms such as Hadoop or Spark. In\
    \ this way,\nsubscriptions are made to OCB entities, which notify the system of\
    \ a change to store the data.\n3.\nIntelligence Data Advanced Solution (IDAS):This\
    \ GE acts as a language interpreter between the\ndifferent communication protocols\
    \ used in IoT to the NGSI standard. The communication\nprotocols available are\
    \ LightweightM2M (LWM2M) over Constrained Application Protocol\n(CoaP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight over Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n(HTTP)/Message\
    \ Queue Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT), or Object Linking and Embedding\n\
    for Process Control-Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC-UA).\n4.\nWilma: It is in charge\
    \ of guaranteeing the security of the system since it provides functions to act\n\
    as a proxy within Open authorization Authentication schemes (OAuth2).\n5.\nPerseus:\
    \ This GE deﬁnes a set of rules in OCB, which makes a notiﬁcation to the system\
    \ or end\nuser by means of Short Message Service (SMS), emails, or HTTP requests.\n\
    3.2. MPC Technique\nMPC is one of the most general ways of formulating a control\
    \ problem. This methodology is\nnot an explicit control technique, but rather,\
    \ it involves a family of control methods based on the\nuse of a model of the\
    \ system to obtain the control signals by minimizing a given cost function [34].\n\
    The methodology can be explained according to Figure 1 and the points below:\n\
    1.\nThe outputs of the process are predicted at each sampling time t along a given\
    \ prediction horizon\nN, by using a model of the system. The predicted outputs,\
    \ denoted by ˆx(t + j|t) for j = 1, . . . , N,\ndepend on past outputs, inputs,\
    \ and disturbances and on the value of future control actions\nu(t + j − 1|t)\
    \ for j = 1, . . . , N. Note that the notation (t + j|t) is related to the predicted\
    \ value of a\nvariable at the instant time t + j, calculated with the information\
    \ available at instant t.\n2.\nThe set of future control actions is calculated\
    \ by minimizing a determined cost function.\n3.\nThe control signal u(t|t) is\
    \ sent to the process while the rest of the control actions are rejected\nbecause\
    \ at the next sampling time, ˆx(t + 1) will be known, allowing repeating the ﬁrst\
    \ step with\nthe updated information. This methodology is known as the receding\
    \ horizon concept.\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n6 of 21\nFigure 1. MPC strategy.\n\
    It should be noted that this methodology is especially suitable for being applied\
    \ in the IoT\nplatform as it allows developing an easy control law with very limited\
    \ knowledge and information of\nthe different agents composing the distributed\
    \ water network. The MPC strategy only requires the\nmodel of the system at hand,\
    \ which is intrinsic controller information, and the required information to\n\
    execute it for the calculation of the optimal control signals [34].\n3.3. IoT-Architecture\n\
    The proposed architecture for the IoT platform can be described as a pyramidal\
    \ diagram as shown\nin Figure 2. As can be seen, this architecture is divided\
    \ into three layers that are independent of each\nother, allowing adding or removing\
    \ services without affecting the operation of the previous layer. It is\nbased\
    \ on a back end architecture, front end, and context generators.\nThis architecture\
    \ is deﬁned as a cloud architecture that encompasses storage functionalities,\
    \ a\nplatform as a service, and connectivity. This kind of architecture allows\
    \ the user to detach speciﬁc\nsoftware or custom developments to integrate it\
    \ with the system. The objective is to be able to perform\nservices and microservices\
    \ between different components of the cloud architecture. It is divided into\n\
    two large back end and front end sections, which are in turn interconnected through\
    \ virtual networks\nor the Internet. There are other parts of cloud architectures\
    \ that are used, such as middleware, among\nother resources. The architecture\
    \ can be explained according to the following points:\n•\nLayer 0, context producers\
    \ in Figure 2: IoT systems need devices that provide the data needed\nfor ecosystem\
    \ management. The IoT consists of a physical device or a network of physical\n\
    devices capable of exchanging data, informing the environment to which they belong.\
    \ Each\ndevice consists of an integrated microcontroller and software that can\
    \ act as a sensor or actuator.\nThe sensors are in charge of sending information\
    \ about the state of certain elements available\nin their environment, and the\
    \ actuators are in charge of carrying out actions that are directly\ninterconnected\
    \ with the data provided by the sensors. Each device is uniquely identiﬁed through\n\
    the built-in computer system, but can also be identiﬁed as belonging to an existing\
    \ Internet\ninfrastructure or device network. As already mentioned, FIWARE is\
    \ a system based on managing\ncontext information. The term context, applied to\
    \ an intelligent Internet solution of things, is\nassociated with the set of related\
    \ elements capable of reporting the state in which the system is.\nEach IoT element\
    \ will be represented as a unique entity within the context. IoT devices can range\n\
    from simple to complex devices such as temperature, humidity, or radiation sensors\
    \ or relays as\nactuators to launch orders.\n•\nLayer 1, back end in Figure 2:\
    \ It is the data access layer also known as the logical part of an\napplication.\
    \ It is located facing the server and is responsible for managing all services\
    \ related\nto the data. In the back end, all the system tasks are performed, such\
    \ as numerical calculations,\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n7 of 21\nsecurity layer management,\
    \ data access, REST services, and databases, among others. The main\nobjective\
    \ and beneﬁt of having a back end decoupled from an application or simple architecture\
    \ is\nthe possibility of making different developments without affecting the functionality\
    \ by improving\nthe security of the system, the possibility of rescaling the service\
    \ depending on the needs of\nthe client, generating REST services allowing the\
    \ back end information to interact with any\nclient or service. In this work,\
    \ the back end is formed by seven services, each independent\nof the others, but\
    \ at the same time, forming a functional architecture. These services range\n\
    from interpreters of communication protocols between sensors and the system itself,\
    \ elements\nresponsible for information management, databases, REST services,\
    \ and processes responsible for\nprocess control.\n•\nLayer 2, front end in Figure\
    \ 2: This is the layer linked to the client, and therefore, it is in charge of\n\
    the visualization of all the data. It is composed by a set of technologies that\
    \ form the structure and\ndesign of the application. The most used programming\
    \ languages for the development of this\nlayer are JavaScript and PHP, as well\
    \ as languages based on design and layout, such as HTML\nand CSS.\nFigure 2. IoT\
    \ platform as a pyramidal diagram.\n3.4. Case Study in Almería\nIn order to evidence\
    \ the results that can be achieved with the application of the proposed platform,\n\
    a case study based on three real facilities located in Almería was used. The schematic\
    \ diagram of\nthe case study is shown in Figure 3, and it was used to represent\
    \ an agroindustrial district composed\nby several consumers agents (i.e., three\
    \ greenhouses and an ofﬁce building) and two water sources\n(i.e., a solar desalination\
    \ plant and the water public utility network). Note that this small scale\nagroindustrial\
    \ district was chosen to be representative of an industrial scale one and allow\
    \ visualizing\nthe results in a simple way. The plants included in the district\
    \ are described in the following subsections.\nIt should be remarked that in the\
    \ following subsections, the real location of the plants is established,\nbut\
    \ in real cases of application, the desalination plant should be located on the\
    \ coast and the building\nnear the greenhouses.\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n8 of 21\n\
    Figure 3. Layout of the case study.\n3.4.1. Solar Desalination Plant\nThe solar\
    \ desalination plant used as a reference in the case study was based on the Solar\
    \ Membrane\nDistillation (SMD) facility at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA,\
    \ www.psa.es), in southeast Spain.\nA real image of the plant is included in Figure\
    \ 3. This facility was fully described in [35], and it is\ncomprised of a solar\
    \ ﬁeld, which is responsible for providing the thermal power required by the\n\
    Membrane Distillation (MD) procedure, several MD modules, and a heat exchanger\
    \ connecting both\nsystems. The plant is totally controlled, monitoring the main\
    \ variables of the distillation procedure\nas pressure, temperature, and ﬂow rate.\
    \ It should be commented that for the present work, it was\nassumed that all the\
    \ control and measurement systems were based on the IoT paradigm, and they\nwere\
    \ able to receive and send information directly from or to the cloud (see Figure\
    \ 3).\nAs stated in [10], an industrial scale MD plant (as the one used in this\
    \ work) must be composed of\nan array of MD modules since the production of current\
    \ commercial MD modules is still relatively low,\naround 30 L/h in optimal operating\
    \ conditions. Thus, each singular MD module was connected to\nthe array composing\
    \ the overall desalination unit, as was presented in [36], so that each MD module\n\
    could be turned on/off depending on the state of the valves, which allowed us\
    \ to adjust the distillate\nproduction to the water demand, thus obtaining economical\
    \ savings in the operation of the feed water\npump. In particular, the MD module\
    \ used in this work was the Aquastill one, which was totally\ndescribed in [10].\
    \ As reported in that work, the module had a limited operating range in terms\
    \ of\ntemperature and feed ﬂow rate. The temperature at the inlet of the evaporator\
    \ channel of the MD\nmodule could vary between 60 and 80 ◦C, whereas the ﬂow rate\
    \ between 400 and 600 L/h.\nThe feed solution enters though the condenser channel\
    \ of the MD module, where it is preheated\nwith the latent heat that crosses the\
    \ membrane. Then, it is driven to the heat exchanger where the feed\nsolution\
    \ is heated with the ﬂuid coming from the solar ﬁeld. At last, the heated solution\
    \ is ﬂowed to the\nevaporator channel of the MD module, where the volatile molecules\
    \ of the solution are evaporated and\npass through the membrane, whereas the non-volatile\
    \ ones are rejected in the form of brine. It should\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n9\
    \ of 21\nbe remarked that in this work, it was assumed that the feed solution\
    \ was water coming from the\nMediterranean sea at 35 g/L (mean salinity).\nFor\
    \ the application of the MPC technique, a model of the desalination unit is required\
    \ in order to\npredict its total distillate production (DT). As was presented\
    \ in [10], the Aquastill module could be\neasily modeled by means of a polynomial\
    \ equation based on empirical data. In this work, the same\nmodel was used, but\
    \ it was modiﬁed by introducing binary variables (δi with i = 1, . . . , NMD where\n\
    NMD is the number of MD modules in the array ﬁxed at 30) related to the position\
    \ of the valves of each\nMD module i, assuming a value of zero when the MD module\
    \ is turned off and one otherwise. In this\nway, the total distillate production\
    \ of the overall desalination unit can be calculated as:\nDT(t) =\nNMD\n∑\ni=1\n\
    \x02(3.24 + 0.072 · Tcs,out(t) − 0.4896 · Tf eed(t)) · (1 − δi(t)) + (−0.024 ·\
    \ F(t)\n+ 0.0096 · Tcs,out(t) · F(t)) · δi(t)\n\x03\n,\n(1)\nwhere all the terms\
    \ of the equation are in L/h and all the variables are presented in Appendix A.\n\
    It should be noted that, when an MD module is turned on, it is operated at its\
    \ maximum operating\nrange in terms of feed ﬂow rate (i.e., F(t) = 600 L/h), which\
    \ is its optimal operating point [10]. In this\nway, all the variables in the\
    \ previous equation are constant and known, except δi with i = 1, . . . , NMD,\n\
    which are computed by means of the MPC technique.\nMoreover, as the MPC technique\
    \ is aimed at reducing costs, the operating cost associated with\nthe operation\
    \ of the feed water pump must be estimated. For this aim, the electric power consumption\n\
    of the feed water pump was calculated making use of the characteristic pump curve\
    \ supplied by the\nmanufacturer. The same pump as the one in [37] was used, whose\
    \ characteristic curve is given by:\nPf (t) = 22.72 · c1 ·\nNMD\n∑\ni=1\n\x02\n\
    F(t) · δi(t)\n\x03 + 39.54,\n(2)\nwhere c1 is a conversion factor to transform\
    \ L/h into m3/s so that all the terms of the equation are in\nkW. Note that the\
    \ summation term was used to take into account all the MD modules as the total\
    \ feed\nwater ﬂow rate was equal to the sum of feed ﬂow rate of all the modules.\n\
    It should be remarked that this model must be executed in the cloud, integrated\
    \ in the MPC\nstrategy of the IoT architecture. For this reason, it is important\
    \ to note that the information exchanged\nbetween the plant and the cloud was\
    \ minimum because of the way in which the models were posed.\nThe plant had to\
    \ send information only about the temperature at the outlet of the heat exchanger\
    \ for\nthe cold side (Tcs,out) and the feed temperature (Tf eed), and it had to\
    \ receive information only about δi\nvariables, with i = 1, . . . , NMD. Moreover,\
    \ as the MD modules in the array were identical, the value\nof these variables\
    \ could be given only using an integer variable (NMD) that contains the number\
    \ of\nmodules turned on at each sampling time, that is:\nNMD =\nNMD\n∑\ni=1\n\
    δi.\n(3)\nNotice also that the desalination facility was connected to a storage\
    \ tank. The use of this device in this\nkind of systems is natural, as water is\
    \ a resource that can be stored. In this way, the storage device acted as\nan\
    \ integrator system, helping to smooth the water demands, and for this reason,\
    \ its level (L) must also be\nsent to the IoT platform. This tank could be directly\
    \ used or connected to the water distribution network.\n3.4.2. Greenhouses\nThe\
    \ greenhouse environments included in the case study were based on the pilot greenhouse\n\
    located at Experimental Station of the Cajamar Foundation (also located in southeast\
    \ Spain, 40 km\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n10 of 21\nfrom the PSA), and real images\
    \ of this facility can be seen in Figure 3. This pilot plant is formed\nby a multi-span\
    \ “Parral-type” greenhouse with E-W orientation.\nThe total surface area of the\n\
    facility is 821 m2, among which 616 m2 are effective cultivation area. The cover\
    \ of the greenhouse is\npolyethylene, and it includes an automatic ventilation\
    \ system with side windows on the south and\nnorth walls. In addition, the greenhouse\
    \ is equipped with a diesel aerothermal system, a biomass\nfueled heating system,\
    \ a humidiﬁcation/dehumidiﬁcation system, and LED lights. The crop grows\nin rows\
    \ with N-S-orientation, inside coconut coir bags, with three droppers and six\
    \ plants each.\nThe irrigation is performed by means of a demand tray system,\
    \ which applies the irrigation to the\ncrop periodically throughout each day.\
    \ In [38], a more detailed description and explanation of the\ngreenhouse environment\
    \ can be found.\nAs in the desalination plant, the greenhouse was totally controlled\
    \ and monitored, measuring\nvariables such as solar irradiance, relative humidity,\
    \ air temperature, CO2, wind direction and speed,\nand soil and cover temperature.\
    \ For the purpose of this work, the greenhouses had to send information\nabout\
    \ their water requirements, which could be estimated by using well known models\
    \ already\npresented in literature and based on the aforementioned measured variables,\
    \ as was done in [10].\nThus, the IoT platform received information about the\
    \ water needs of Greenhouses 1, 2, and 3 (DGH1,\nDGH2, DGH3, respectively), and\
    \ based on this information and according to the water production of\nthe desalination\
    \ plant (DT) and the level of the intermediate tank (L), it had to decide the\
    \ amount of\nwater from the desalination plant and the public utility network\
    \ used to cover the requirements of each\ngreenhouse. Therefore, the IoT platform\
    \ had to send the variables PN2GH1 and DP2GH1, PN2GH2\nand DP2GH2, and PN2GH3\
    \ and DP2GH3, which were the water coming from the public utility\nnetwork and\
    \ the water coming from the desalination plant for Greenhouses 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\
    Note that for the simulations, it was assumed that the greenhouses had a tomato\
    \ crop in a state of\ngrowth, with a Leaf Area Index (LAI) of 5.5 and in full\
    \ production.\n3.4.3. Ofﬁce Building\nThe ofﬁce building incorporated in the case\
    \ study was based on the Centro de Investigación\nde la Energía Solar (CIESOL)\
    \ building (www.ciesol.es) located at the University of Almería campus,\nalso\
    \ in south east Spain, 20 km away from PSA. This building had a total surface\
    \ area of 1071.91 m2\ndistributed into two ﬂoors. In addition, as in the other\
    \ facilities composing the case study, CIESOL had\na net of sensors to monitor\
    \ the main variables affecting the building such as temperature, electricity,\n\
    and water consumption. More details about the building can be found elsewhere\
    \ [39].\nFor the management of the water network of the case study, the building\
    \ had to send its water\nrequirements (DOB) to the IoT platform, and as happened\
    \ with the greenhouses, the IoT platform had\nto send to the building the amount\
    \ of water coming from the desalination plant (DP2OB) and the\npublic utility\
    \ network (PN2OB).\n3.5. Application of the IoT Platform to the Case Study\nThe\
    \ architecture proposed in this paper for the management of the agroindustrial\
    \ district\npresented above in terms of water is shown in Figure 4. As mentioned\
    \ in Section 3.3, it was divided into\nthree layers: context producers, back end,\
    \ and front end. It is important to remark that the proposed\narchitecture was\
    \ based on that already developed for the IoF2020UC4.2 Vegetables project [40,41],\n\
    with the particularity of applying control techniques, among other data extraction\
    \ functionalities\nadapted to this system.\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n11 of 21\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture of the IoT platform.\n3.5.1. Layer 0 Context Producers\n\
    All the devices and elements in charge of generating context information were\
    \ available in this\nlayer. Different kind of actuators and sensors were available\
    \ in each plant forming the agroindustrial\ndistrict. These sensors were connected\
    \ to different commercial IoT stations or data acquisition systems.\nThere were\
    \ six types of context information production scenarios distributed in different\
    \ parts of the\nproposed scenario: a solar desalination plant, three Parral-type\
    \ greenhouses, an ofﬁce building, and\na water storage device. These facilities\
    \ sent the measurements collected by the sensors to the cloud\nthrough the MQTT\
    \ or HTTP requests, depending on the data extraction format. MQTT is one of the\n\
    most extended communication protocols used in the IoT paradigm due to its lightness\
    \ and simplicity,\nwhich are mainly produced by the power limitations in the devices\
    \ and the bandwidth. It is based on\nthe Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\
    \ Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol, which reuses already open\nconnections, unlike the\
    \ HTTP 1.0 protocol, which makes new connections. Its operation is based on\n\
    push messaging as editor/subscriber and themes. In addition, it has a central\
    \ broker that manages the\nregistration of the client’s connections, allowing\
    \ subscriptions to different topics. On the one hand,\nMQTT will be used for sending\
    \ smart sensors to OCB; on the other hand, HTTP will be used for\nsending data\
    \ from the acquisition systems to OCB.\n3.5.2. Layer 1 Backend\nThis section describes\
    \ the layer in charge of managing all the operations of the IoT system. Each\n\
    of the services that make up this data layer was independent of the others, thus\
    \ allowing updates and\ndevelopments without affecting the performance and stability\
    \ of the system. It was formed by a set of\nservices that interacted with each\
    \ other to form the ecosystem based on FIWARE:\n•\nExtract context information:\
    \ This service is responsible for extracting, transforming, and sending\nthe data\
    \ to the IoT system. There are two services calledIDAS (represented by the block\
    \ agent\nin Figure 4) and Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), responsible for\
    \ translating the information\nthat comes from the sensors to the NGSI standard\
    \ (see Figure 4). The objective of having two\ninterpretation systems is to provide\
    \ a solution that is as complete as possible. The context\ninformation can come\
    \ from three data sources: commercial systems with their own REST services\n(represented\
    \ in the form of a cloud API in Figure 4 based on General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GPRS)\ncommunication), data acquisition systems connected to a PC, and smart\
    \ sensors prepared to send\nthese data to the cloud. Commercial stations are available\
    \ from the following manufacturers:\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n12 of 21\nHortisys\
    \ of the Hispatec model, iMetos of the Pessl model, iMetos ECO D3, and the Hops\
    \ model.\nThe ﬁrst service called ETL (see Figure 4) is responsible for extracting\
    \ data from REST services of\ncommercial stations or data acquisition systems\
    \ connected to a PC, making the transformation\nto the NGSI standard, and then,\
    \ sending it directly to OCB. The second service called IDAS\n(represented by\
    \ the block agent in Figure 4) is an enabler developed by FIWARE, which comes\n\
    into use in the case of having intelligent sensors sending data directly to OCB,\
    \ performing the\nfunction of interpreting the MQTT communication protocol that\
    \ these sensors use for the FIWARE\nNGSI standard.\n•\nOCB: It is the core of\
    \ the architecture (see Figure 4), and it is tasked with handling the\ncontext\
    \ information. It acts as an intermediary between producers (publishers) and consumers\n\
    (subscribers). It is based on the NGSI speciﬁcation deﬁned by OMA. The data model\
    \ is based on\nentities, attributes, and metadata. There are six entities for\
    \ each of the context producers: solar\ndesalination plant, water storage tank,\
    \ Greenhouse 1, Greenhouse 2, Greenhouse 3, and ﬁnally,\nofﬁce building. Table\
    \ 1 shows exclusively each of the entities with their respective attributes\n\
    and metadata necessary to perform the MPC technique. In addition, each of these\
    \ entities has a\nset of sensors and actuators, sending the information to OCB.\
    \ In Table 1, the internal attributes\ncan be seen of the variables generated\
    \ by these entities with the needs of the system, while the\ncontroller external\
    \ attributes column includes those variables generated when applying the MPC\n\
    techniques (each of these variables are explained in the Section 3.4). The objective\
    \ of including\nthe controller external attributes within the entity is to be\
    \ able to link the system actuator with\nthis attribute, allowing the action to\
    \ be performed directly. This fact creates a new entity MPC\ncontroller. To differentiate\
    \ between different types of stations in the same entity, FIWARE-Service\nand\
    \ FIWARE-ServicePathare used, permitting hierarchical scopes in the same entity.\
    \ The ﬁrst\nelement deﬁnes the name of the plant, whereas the second one, the\
    \ name of the station or set\nof sensors. Each one of the sensors is detailed\
    \ independently with its name and value in the\nattributes. Within these attributes,\
    \ metadata are available, giving the possibility of creating ﬁelds\nsuch as the\
    \ date when reading data and the common name, among others.\n•\nREST API services:\
    \ There are two types of services, one in charge of carrying out the persistence\n\
    of the data and the other that manages the requests on behalf of the client. These\
    \ two services\nare encapsulated within the REST API module (see Figure 4). As\
    \ mentioned above, OCB allows\nentities to subscribe, and this is because the\
    \ ﬁrst REST service carries out a series of subscriptions\nto each of the available\
    \ entities. When one of these entities undergoes a change in any of its\nattributes,\
    \ this will be notiﬁed to all the services subscribed to the entity. An HTTP request\
    \ will be\nsent to the persistence service, which will check if the data and date\
    \ already exist in the system\nbefore saving the measurement. The second service\
    \ offers a REST API, which is exposed to the\nend user through an application.\
    \ The end user will make the necessary requests to the system,\nand it will return\
    \ the requested response in JSON format.\n•\nCron process: This service is a Unix\
    \ cron process (see Figure 4) designed to run periodically every\n15 min. Its\
    \ objective is to retrieve the data from the previous REST service in charge of\
    \ obtaining\nthe database information and send it to the controller to perform\
    \ the MPC control technique.\nOnce the controller ﬁnishes the execution, this\
    \ same service sends the parameters of Table 1’s\ncontroller external attributes\
    \ column to its corresponding entity, updating the OCB information\nand thus the\
    \ actuator with the new execution parameters. When there is a subscription to\
    \ each\nentity, it notiﬁes again a change to the REST service in charge of persisting\
    \ the information and\nperforms the action of saving in the database.\n•\nMPC\
    \ controller: This is the service in charge of carrying out the optimal management\
    \ of the water\nresources (see Section 3.4). This service (see Figure 4) is controlled\
    \ by a cron process and allows\nconsulting the needs of each system through the\
    \ REST service and inserting the new instructions\nin the control column of the\
    \ external attributes of each entity (see Table 1). All the details about\nthe\
    \ implementation of the MPC controller are presented in Appendix B.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 596\n13 of 21\n•\nDatabase: This architecture is supported by a non-relational\
    \ database. It is based on MongoDB\n(see Figure 4), which allows managing a large\
    \ volume of data, easy scalability, and a dynamic\ndata model. The latter is essential\
    \ in this architecture, as it allows adding or removing sensors\nfrom each entity\
    \ without the risk of affecting the operation of the system.\nTable 1. Entities\

    \ Layer 2 Front End\nThis is the data visualization layer. The user makes the\
    \ necessary requests to the system from this\nservice. The objective of separating\
    \ the front end as an independent service is to give versatility to the\nsystem\
    \ of creating a web, desktop, or hybrid application. Any changes made to the application\
    \ do not\naffect the operation of the IoT system.\n4. Results and Discussion\n\
    4.1. Simulation Results\nTo evidence the results that could be attained with the\
    \ application of the designed IoT platform in\nan agroindustrial district, a simulation\
    \ was carried out in MATLAB 2018b with the YALMIP toolbox.\nTo perform the simulation,\
    \ real Meteorological data from PSA and from Experimental Station of\nCajamar\
    \ Foundation on the day 20 July 2017 were used. The models of the desalination\
    \ plant and the\ngreenhouses presented in [37,38] respectively were simulated\
    \ with the actual meteorological data to\nobtain Tcs,out and DGH1 and DGH2 and\
    \ DGH3. Moreover, in order to add difﬁculty to the management\nproblem, different\
    \ sizes were used for simulating the greenhouses, so that the size of Greenhouses\n\
    1 and 2 was ﬁxed at 1 ha, whereas that of Greenhouse 3 at 0.5 ha. Besides, the\
    \ irradiance data for\nGreenhouse 3 were shifted forward 15 min in the simulations.\
    \ Conversely, real water consumption\ndata of the aforementioned day from CIESOL\
    \ building were used for DOB. These data were also scaled\nconsidering a building\
    \ with a surface area of 400 m2. Notice that to test the proposed strategy, two\n\
    days were simulated duplicating the data, but augmenting the irradiance proﬁles\
    \ used for simulating\nGreenhouses 2 and 3 in the second day in order to augment\
    \ their water demand.\nThe conﬁguration parameters of the MPC controller were\
    \ set as: (i) sampling time (Ts) ﬁxed at\n15 min, which was chosen taking into\
    \ account the dynamics of the ofﬁce building, desalination, and\ngreenhouses,\
    \ and (ii) prediction horizon (N) ﬁxed at six. Note that the prediction horizon\
    \ must be\nselected large enough in order to catch the process transients. However,\
    \ it should be taken into account\nthat as the prediction horizon (N) increases,\
    \ so does the amount of decision variables included in the\noptimization problem\
    \ and, therefore, the computational time. For this reason, the prediction horizon\n\
    was chosen considering a tradeoff between these two issues and after exhaustive\
    \ simulations.\nThe results obtained from the simulations are presented in Figure\
    \ 5. It is worth noting that the\ncosts related to the water coming from the public\
    \ utility network are higher than those related to the\noperation of the feed\
    \ pump of the desalination plant, even when all the MD modules are in operation.\n\
    Therefore, the optimal management consists of feeding the consumer agents by the\
    \ desalination plant\nwhenever possible. In this way, at the end of the day, the\
    \ storage tank level must be zero or very close\nto this value. Consequently,\
    \ the initial state of the storage tank level was set to 50 L (see Figure 5(1)).\n\

    \ All the variables are according to Appendix A.\nIn this way, around Sample 34,\
    \ the ofﬁce building started demanding water (see Figure 5(6)), and\nin Sample\
    \ 35, also Greenhouses 1 and 2 (see Figure 5(3),(4)). Nevertheless, as the temperature\
    \ Tcs,out\nwas below T∗ at that moment (see Figure 5(2)), the desalination plant\
    \ could not still produce fresh\nwater, and the water requirements were met by\
    \ the remaining water in the tank and water coming\nfrom the water utility public\
    \ network. At Sample 37, the temperature Tcs,out was above T∗, and the\ndesalination\
    \ plant was turned on by the MPC controller (see Figure 5(2)). For the rest of\
    \ the operation\non this day, the greenhouse water necessities and the ones of\
    \ the ofﬁce building were satisﬁed by the\ndesalination plant. The beneﬁt of using\
    \ an MPC controller was especially shown at the end of the day.\nIn that moment,\
    \ and before Tcs,out reaching T∗, the MPC controller increased the amount of modules\n\
    turned on (see Sample 70 in Figure 5(2)) trying to augment the water stored in\
    \ the tank, thus avoiding\nthe use of water coming from the public utility network\
    \ when all the MD modules were turned off.\nIn the second operating day, the beginning\
    \ of the operation was similar to that from the previous\nday, but on this occasion,\
    \ there was no water left in the storage tank, so that only water coming from\n\
    the public utility network was used to fulﬁl the water needs. Moreover, as shown\
    \ in Figure 5(3),(4),\nthe water necessities of Greenhouses 2 and 3 were higher\
    \ than in the ﬁrst operating day. This fact\ncaused the MPC controller to turn\
    \ on all the MD modules included in the array (see Figure 5(2)).\nHowever, the\
    \ water production of the desalination facility was not enough to fulﬁl the water\
    \ needs,\nand for this reason, the water production was complemented with water\
    \ coming from the public utility\nnetwork, as shown in Figure 5(3)–(6). Finally,\
    \ at the end of the day, the same fact happened as in the\nﬁrst day: the water\
    \ level of the tank was increased to meet the water needs without using the public\n\
    utility network when the desalination plant was turned off.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 596\n15 of 21\n4.2. Comparative Operating Cost Analysis\nTo illustrate the beneﬁts\
    \ achieved in terms of operating costs with the application of the proposed\n\
    IoT platform in real agroindustrial districts, the results shown in the previous\
    \ subsection were\ncompared to those obtained using a manual operation. The manual\
    \ operation consisted of turning on\nall the MD modules as long as Tcs,out was\
    \ higher than T∗, which was not optimal from the point of\nview of the operation\
    \ of the desalination plant, as it was producing more water than necessary and,\n\
    therefore, consuming more electricity (increasing costs). The results are presented\
    \ in Table 2.\nTable 2. Comparative operating cost results. TPNCis the total operating\
    \ cost associated to the water\ncoming from the public utility network; TDPCis\

    \ in the speciﬁc cost of the water demanded, as it can be\nseen in Table 2 how\
    \ with the application of the proposed method, the cost per unit of water demanded\n\
    was 0.44 e/m3, whereas by using a non-optimal manual procedure, the cost was 1.51\
    \ e/m3.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work addressed the development of an IoT based water\
    \ management architecture to be\napplied in agroindustrial districts including\
    \ desalination plants, connection to the public utility\nnetwork, and several\
    \ consumer agents. The core of the platform was based on the use of FIWARE and\n\
    an MPC controller that reﬂected the operational strategy in real time. Simulation\
    \ tests using a case\nstudy based on three real facilities located in Almería\
    \ were performed. The obtained results allowed\nus to draw the following conclusions:\n\
    1.\nThe use of enabling technologies such as IoT on agroindustrial districts could\
    \ be an effective tool\nto carry out the optimal management of the heterogeneous\
    \ resources required by the elements\nthat make up these environments.\n2.\nIn\
    \ particular, the application of the proposed method to the case study demonstrated\
    \ how an\noptimal management of the water resources could be done, adapting the\
    \ water production of the\ndesalination plant to the water demand of the consumer\
    \ agents and minimizing the use of water\ncoming from the public utility network,\
    \ thus making a proper use of desalination facilities.\n3.\nThe comparative cost\
    \ analysis performed with a manual operation showed how around 75%\nof the operational\
    \ cost could be saved. In this way, the cost per unit of water demanded in the\n\
    agroindustrial district was reduced with the application of the proposed strategy\
    \ from 1.51 e/m3\n(cost of the manual operation) to 0.44 e/m3. This could be very\
    \ relevant to maintain the economic\nsustainability of the agricultural system\
    \ of Almería.\nIn relation to future work, the speed of computing and latency\
    \ when replicating the control\nsystem on edge computing versus the current cloud\
    \ computing could be compared. In this way, it\nwould be possible to detect which\
    \ system performs better control and what the response times would\nbe. Furthermore,\
    \ it would be interesting to carry out an economic viability analysis taking into\
    \ account\nthe different IoT systems, transport infrastructures, and desalination\
    \ costs.\nSensors 2020, 20, 596\n16 of 21\nAuthor Contributions: J.D.G. and M.M.\

    \ function (Equation (A1)) aims to reduce the operational costs\nof the agroindustrial\
    \ district in terms of water, considering the cost of the water coming from the\n\
    public utility network (CPN) and that of the feed water pump of the desalination\
    \ plant (CDP). Note\nthat other types of costs in the desalination plant, as the\
    \ ones of the solar ﬁeld feeding it, have\nnot been taken into account as they\
    \ were already optimized in the previous published work [37].\nThe optimization\
    \ problem is subjected to a set of process and operational constraints, which\
    \ are\npresented in Equations (A2)–(A18).\nFirstly, the set of constraints in\
    \ Equations (A2)–(A10) is related to the desalination plant. In this set,\nthe\
    \ constraints in Equations (A2) and (A3) are used to compute the distillate production\
    \ ( ˆ\nDT(t + j|t))\nalong the prediction horizon. Note that the model presented\
    \ in Equation (1) is employed, but an\nauxiliary binary variable βi(t + j − 1|t)\
    \ with i = 1, . . . , NMD for taking into account the MD modules\nstates (turned\
    \ on/off) is used instead of the actual variable δi(t + j − 1|t) with i = 1, .\
    \ . . , NMD. This is\nbecause the modules can be only turned on if the temperature\
    \ required to operate them (T∗=60 oC) is\nreached. Thus, this statement is included\
    \ in the optimization problem using the set of constraints in\nEquations (A4)–(A6),\
    \ so that another auxiliary binary variable γ(t + j − 1|t) takes the value of\
    \ one if the\naforementioned statement is true and zero otherwise. Finally, the\
    \ value of the actual variable related\nto the valve position of each MD module\
    \ (δi(t + j − 1|t) with i = 1, . . . , NMD) is computed at each\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 596\n19 of 21\ninstant time as δi(t + j − 1|t) = βi(t + j − 1|t) · γi(t\
    \ + j − 1|t) ∀i = 1, . . . , NMD. This multiplication is\nformulated in the problem\
    \ by means of a set of linear constraints (see Equations (A7)–(A10)).\nSecondly,\
    \ the constraints in Equations (A11) and (A12) are related to the tank level.\
    \ The ﬁrst one\nis used to compute the level (ˆL(t + j|t)) along the prediction\
    \ horizon, which is calculated based on\nthe level of the previous instant time\
    \ (ˆL(t + j − 1|t)), the water that is received from the desalination\nplant (\
    \ ˆ\nDT(t + j|t)), and the water that is sent to to the ofﬁce building and Greenhouses\
    \ 1, 2, and 3\n(\nˆ\nDP2OB(t + j|t),\nˆ\nDP2GH1(t + j|t),\nˆ\nDP2GH2(t + j|t),\
    \ and\nˆ\nDP2GH3(t + j|t), respectively). The second\none deﬁnes the maximum and\
    \ minimum level of the tank.\nThirdly, the constraints in Equations (A13)–(A16)\
    \ deﬁne the relationship between producers and\nconsumer agents, so that the water\
    \ demanded by each consumer agent must be covered by the sum of\nthe water that\
    \ it receives from the desalination plant and from the water public utility network.\n\
    Fourthly, the constraints in Equations (A17) and (A18) are used to calculate the\
    \ cost related to the\noperation of the feed water pump of the desalination plant\
    \ (CDP) and that of the water coming from\nthe public utility network (CPN) along\
    \ the prediction horizon.\nOnce the overall MPC problem is formulated, it should\
    \ be pointed out that the decision variables\nof the optimization problem are\
    \ δi and βi ∀i = 1, . . . , NMD, γ, DP2GH1, PN2GH1, DP2GH2, PN2GH2,\nDP2GH3, PN2GH3,\
    \ DP2OB, and PN2OB. Conversely, L, Tcs,out, Tf eed, DGH1, DGH2, DGH3, and DOB\n\
    are state variables whose values change according to the operational conditions\
    \ of the desalination\nplant and the greenhouses and ofﬁce building, respectively.\
    \ In the simulations, real data were used for\npredicting these variables.\nReferences\n\

    Footnotes Abstract: Digital agriculture, with the incorporation of Internet-of-Things
    (IoT)-based technologies, presents the ability to control a system at multiple
    levels (individual, local, regional, and global) and generates tools that allow
    for improved decision making and higher productivity. Recent advances in IoT hardware,
    e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight
    computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible
    to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm.
    By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances,
    it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time
    (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used
    for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced
    environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for
    IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture.
    We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will
    underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies. Our paper starts off with the
    types of datasets in typical field operations, followed by the lifecycle for the
    data and storage, cloud and edge analytics, and fast information-retrieval solutions.
    We discuss what algorithms are proving to be most impactful in this space, e.g.,
    approximate data analytics and on-device/in-network processing. We conclude by
    discussing analytics for alternative agriculture for generation of biofuels and
    policy challenges in the implementation of digital agriculture in the wild. Published

    I. Introduction By 2050, the world''s population is projected to increase to nine
    billion, which will intensify the food-water-energy nexus challenges. Demand will
    also rise because of increase in people''s wealth resulting in higher meat consumption
    plus the increasing use of cropland for biofuels. Site-specific farm management
    (precision farming) has the potential to nourish the world while increasing farm
    profitability under constrained resource conditions. Despite advancements in field
    sensors, the global positioning system (GPS), and grid soil sampling, adoption
    of technology by farm operators has fallen short of expectations. Moreover, it
    is unclear how profitable the adoption of such technologies will be. Use of variable
    rate technology (VRT), for example, has lagged that of yield monitors and automated
    guidance systems. A thorough study [1], including rigorous analysis, has shown
    how the lack of widespread adoption of VRT can be attributed to the paucity of
    site-specific data. Specifically in this study, the authors attributed the scant
    adoption of variable rate nitrogen application to the lack of site-specific yield
    data. The generalizable insight from this is that site-specific detailed data
    about the effects of digital agriculture interventions are important to drive
    their adoption. Identified gaps motivating Lattice Some of the gaps on the agricultural
    side include: Mapping seed variety to performance with better seeds or engineered
    varieties (e.g., via genome editing [2]). Mapping soil supplementation needs to
    regional/temporal conditions using interpretable data science [3]. Defining functional
    properties of derived bioproducts (e.g., ethanol from corn), distinct from traditional
    products (e.g., heavier kernels using genome editing). Conversely, some of the
    gaps in the data engineering and machine learning areas for digital agriculture
    include: Approximate data analytics for processing data from multiple inexpensive
    sensors deployed on connected farms. This is especially important for compute-intensive
    workloads, e.g., vision workloads from drone imaging for object classification/detection,
    e.g., in our recent approximate object classification and detection work [4],
    [5]. Tradeoff between privacy and utility when analyzing data from multiple farms,
    similar to federated computing, used profitably in other fields, e.g., genomics
    [6]. Network management for sparsely connected farms using newer networking solutions
    that are bandwidth-aware and do not require cell towers [7], [8]. Drones and tractors
    for data ferrying when needed especially under sparse network connectivity [9],
    [10]. Effective sharing of data processing and analytics load between sensors,
    edge devices [11], [12], and the cloud for maximizing throughput or latency, based
    on the client (farmer/farm manager) preferences [13], [14]. Optimized cloud computation
    for beefier machine learning workloads using vision APIs, e.g., Azure Vision or
    Amazon Rekognition [15] or processing streaming workloads using on-premise database
    optimization or using optimized clustered cloud instances [16]. Examples of such
    optimization can be found in our recent work for on-premise database optimization
    [17] for streaming workloads or cloud/serverless optimization  [18], [19] for
    computationally-heavier vision [5] or lighter-weight, but latency-sensitive, IoT
    workloads [15]. Data ethics when sharing farm data with agricultural companies
    or insurance providers. On the economics side, VRT for fertilizer treatment, as
    an example, depends on accurate intra-field soil data, which is expensive. Unless
    the economic returns to site-specific management cover both the up-front investment
    and the cost of collecting quality data, adoption will be low. Guidelines for
    VRT use for fertilizer application illustrate the need for: Marking management
    zones for the VRT system. Identifying whether the system will be guided by map-based
    inputs or finer-granularity sensor-based inputs. While the sensor-based inputs
    are more sophisticated because they reflect the changing conditions in the farm,
    they are also logistically and computationally more expensive because they are
    battery-powered and will need to continuously or intermittently be guided by anomaly
    or bottleneck detection [20]. Identifying the kind of data that will be used for
    mapping or the kind of data for the actuation of VRT dispensers. For farmers to
    adopt these technologies (VRT provided as an example and others, e.g., edge-cloud
    data partitioning, discussed in this article), concrete savings on resources (e.g.,
    supplements or fertilizers) need to be demonstrated with potential yield increase
    and environmental protection from decreased farm effluents from nutrient pollution
    and reducing farm runoff and eutrophication (hypertrophication), such as from
    high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous in fresh water. In the case of livestock
    farmers, this translates to the decreased use of hormones, supplements, or antibiotics
    for the livestock, resulting in ecological gains [21], [22]. Relevance of our
    team''s ongoing efforts. Digital agriculture—encompassing precision agriculture,
    data analytics and edge-cloud computing, and data privacy and ownership—has the
    promise to transform agricultural throughput. It can do this by applying data
    science for mapping input factors to crop throughput and that too in a region-specific
    and crop-specific manner, while bounding the available resources, both tangible
    farm-specific resources such as seeds, nutritional supplements, and farm machinery,
    and computational resources (e.g., cloud credits or CPU/GPU cycles) or networking
    expenses (e.g., LoRA or NBIoT towers). In addition, as the volumes and varieties
    of data increase with the increase in sensor deployment in agricultural fields,
    data engineering techniques will also be instrumental in collection of distributed
    data as well as distributed processing of the data. These have to be done such
    that the latency requirements of the end users and applications are satisfied.
    At the same time, Microsoft has developed and is looking to spread the reach of
    the FarmBeats program [23], which has the vision of empowering farmers with low-cost
    digital agriculture solutions using low-cost sensors, drones, and computer vision
    and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Understanding how farm technology and big
    data can improve farm productivity can significantly increase the world''s food
    production by 2050 in the face of constrained arable land and with the water levels
    receding. While much has been written about digital agriculture''s potential,
    little is known about the economic costs and benefits of these emergent systems.
    There are important questions to be answered before data analytics for agriculture,
    questions related to technical viability, economic feasibility, sustainability,
    and data protection and ownership are implemented. These questions cannot be looked
    at in isolation—for example, if some algorithm needs data from multiple data owners
    to be pooled together, that raises the question of data ownership and data privacy.
    In summary, the paper reviews the current state of the following questions and
    presents a look forward at the challenges that need to be resolved, namely: data
    lifecycle for digital agriculture data; applied ML techniques for the domain;
    low-power communication protocols for the domain; economics, policy, and decision
    making driving adoption. Lattice is the first to bring together these questions
    under one roof, discussing the goals, path forward, and challenges of digital
    agriculture to surmount the challenges of the food-water-energy nexus. We present
    an integrated effort Lattice,1 which will culminate in the incorporation of foundational
    AI advances, driven by the domain constraints and requirements of digital agriculture
    systems, resulting in efficient distributed computational infrastructure to execute
    the algorithms. SECTION II. Data Generation From Sensors This section will cover
    the modalities of data gathering and controlled dissemination, the volume of data
    generated, and the quality of the data, collected and processed from ubiquitous
    sensors on farms and includes the following. Soil sampling: Soil samples are extracted
    from field (may or may not be georeferenced) and sent to a lab for analysis. Lab
    results come back in a report detailing fertility levels. In most cases, one must
    manually assign geo-referenced points to report values. Fertilizer application:
    Based on soil sampling, a fertilizer recommendation is generated. If geo-referenced
    points are used, a variable rate prescription can be generated. If fertility results
    are aggregated across the field, a flat rate is applied (proprietary or shapefile).
    Planting: Generated as applied maps with information on population, singulation,
    misses (proprietary or shapefile). Scouting: Conducted as frequently as once a
    week during growing season. Traditionally data comes in the form of a report that
    details presence of disease, insect, and weed pressure. Currently much research
    is being conducted on drone-based scouting using multi-spectral imagery to determine
    nutrient and water deficiencies as well as detect disease, insect, and weed pressure.
    Data format is large image files that need post processing. Spraying: Based on
    the results of the scouting reports spraying operations are conducted. Most modern
    sprayers can generate as applied maps. Files are saved in a proprietary format
    based on the sprayer manufacturer. Harvesting: Yield maps are generated by harvesters
    and saved in a proprietary, manufacturer-specific format. In irrigated fields,
    soil moisture sensors are often used to determine irrigation intervals. Despite
    the wealth of available data in most operations, very little is actually analyzed
    and used to inform future decisions. The most commonly used data sets are scouting
    data (used to make chemical application decisions) and soil sampling data (used
    to make fertilizer recommendations). More progressive producers use yield data
    to determine variable rate fertilizer application and to compare seed varieties.
    Much of the data collected only when the richer context of the data is known.
    This can be known through processing such as aggregation with additional local
    or regional data and attaching the correct metadata. Biorefining: Different bioprocess
    operational modes for converting components of a crop (e.g., corn) are recorded
    during enzyme catalyzed conversion, fermentation, biocatalysis, and separations
    to achieve the desired purity of the target. These data can be used to identify
    inherent barriers, which can be overcome by modifying feedstock. For VRT, with
    advanced electronic controls and improved communication, applications include:
    fertilizer/nutrient applications, manure, seed applications, tillage as a function
    of soil compaction, and irrigation. Thus, if the VRT leverages sensors rather
    than static maps, farm processes can benefit. One primary challenge facing digital
    agriculture is the lack of data sharing, which happens due to technological as
    well as human reasons. The technological impediment centers around the lack of
    interoperability of data collection, processing, and visualization tools. Producers
    are reluctant to share data due to fears of regulatory issues and the lack of
    perceived value. SECTION III. Data Lifecycle This section will cover the various
    phases in the lifecycle of agricultural data—sanitization, loading, processing,
    storing, summarization, and analysis; an example is shown in Fig. 1. This will
    go into some of the general-purpose approaches (e.g., data deduplication, calibration
    using sensor metadata) as well as agriculture-specific approaches (e.g., known
    variations in hyperspectral maps from ground sensing and aerial image data and
    effective fusion among sensor arrays). Figure 1. Example of no-till corn operation,
    data generation, and lifecycle. In modern agriculture, data is generated from
    almost every operation. This data may be site-specific or more broadly defined
    but often there is no clear way to aggregate data layers. Show All Data generation
    sources: Data generation is the first stage of a data lifecycle. There are many
    ways in which data can be generated. The sources of data generation can be broadly
    classified into two types. Localized data or private data: This is the data that
    is generated on the farm such as soil nutrient composition, water, and fertilizer
    usage. This type of data is generated from sensors that are present on the farm.
    Public data: Data such as historic weather conditions and market prices fall under
    this category. Imported data is often generated at outside sources and shared
    with the farmers to use in precision agriculture. Such data is not farm specific.
    An example of data that is at the crux of localized and public data is topography
    and soil type, which may be somewhat localized but follow a trend for farms in
    geographical proximity. Data warehousing: Data generated then needs to be stored
    in repositories called data warehouses. Data warehousing allows integration of
    different data from multiple sources and helps restructure the data for better
    performance. One recent example of data warehousing is an initiative taken from
    the government of India [24], titled INARIS (Integrated National Agricultural
    Resources Information System). Woodard [25] discusses Ag-Analytics—a platform
    that provides data warehousing in the field of precision agriculture. Although
    there are readily available platforms for data warehousing, there are several
    constraints when using these platforms directly in precision agriculture. Some
    of these constraints are discussed in [26]. Metadata annotation: Metadata annotation
    can be done manually or automated. Since the data that we are considering is prone
    to be complex, automated metadata annotation is preferred. Roy, Sarkar, and Ghose
    [27] provides a comparative study of the different learning techniques used for
    metadata annotation. Fiehn, Wohlgemuth, and Scholz [28] provides an algorithm
    for metadata annotation. Haug and Ostermann [29] uses a human expert to first
    mark crops from raw images. Masks were then derived from using these markings.
    These masks are then used to acquire the metadata. Similar techniques can be used
    in different aspects of precision agriculture. Data annotation and cleaning: Due
    to the large size of data, it is important to perform annotation and cleaning
    before data analysis. Data annotation is subjective and depends on the particular
    use case of precision agriculture. The choice of the data annotation technique
    is dictated by the size of the data set, cost of annotation per sample among many
    other guidelines. Schoofs, Guerrieri, Delaney, O''Hare, and Ruzzelli [30] proposes
    a data annotation technique for electricity data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
    Similar annotation techniques could be developed in precision agriculture that
    can be performed in a WSN infrastructure. Data cleaning removes or corrects errors
    that are present in the data. There are several existing works that propose data
    cleaning techniques in precision agriculture. Simbahan, Dobermann, and Ping [31]
    proposed a screening algorithm for cleaning yield data that provided an increase
    in map precision. Sun, Whelan, McBratney, and Minasny [32] proposes an integrated
    framework for software that increases mean yield through data cleaning. Data processing:
    Steven [33] provides a good overview of the constraints faced in data processing
    in precision agriculture. In [33], the authors consider the case of using satellite
    images for remote sensing in precision algorithms. In such use cases, one of the
    important aspects of data processing must be to make the data more readable. One
    such scenario where these images can not be directly used is in the case of cloud
    cover, where the images need to be processed before utilizing the data. This can
    be extended to data acquired through other means as well. Data acquired from soil
    sensors may need to be processed in order to make it more utilizable. Honkavaara
    et al. [34] proposes a processing chain that uses data collected from unmanned
    airborne vehicles to generate meaningful results. Loreto and Morgan [35] proposes
    an automated system that performs both the data acquisition and data processing
    of soil nitrate measurements. Murakami, Saraiva, Junior, Cugnasca, Hirakawa, and
    Correa  [36] proposes a data processing algorithm that processes yield data on
    a distributed framework. SECTION IV. Data Analytics for Digital Agriculture Here,
    we will cover approximate processing for in-sensor analytics, advanced processing
    for backend analytics on the edge or cloud platforms, and interpretable data analytics.
    Analytics workloads are often quite demanding, and do not fit, out-of-the-box,
    into the embedded devices, deployed in agriculture. Advanced processing for backend
    analytics may leverage edge platforms, e.g., Azure IoT Edge device [23], [37],
    and there may be sensitivity of farmers to upload personal data to the cloud.
    Interpretable analytics are important because the farmers will require insights
    into the results of the algorithm, at their level of understanding, to potentially
    take action. In Fig. 2, we show a high-level architecture of the nodes deployed
    in different locations, illustrating the execution of analytics routines on the
    heterogeneous nodes. Figure 2. System architecture of the distributed analytics
    relevant to digital agriculture. Show All Data analytics plays an important role
    in precision agriculture. It can help farmers decide what crop to grow when, monitor
    the crop growth, and decide on the logistics of farm management. But agricultural
    data is often large and noisy and needs careful processing to distill insights
    from them. The following subsections elaborate on the advanced ML capabilities
    that can be used for such analysis. Another relevant technology in this context
    is the use of scalable databases to house and process these data sets for downstream
    processing and retrieval. With this in mind, we also include some innovations
    in NoSQL database technologies to assist in high-throughput information retrieval
    from the evolving agricultural data. Traditionally, this domain did not have requirement
    for low latency—the decisions were more mid-term tactical or strategic and could
    be made in the time frame of hours or days. However, with sophistication in farm
    machinery and automated nutrient application, some use cases of low-latency data
    analytics have evolved. One example is farm machinery moving over a region of
    the farm, queries ground sensors for soil quality or cameras on-board probe for
    pest infestation on the plants. It then analyzes the sensor feed and decides on
    the appropriate application of nutrients/pesticides, actuating the on-board applicator
    on the dispenser, real-time. In Fig. 3, we illustrate data flow in FarmBeats as
    an example. Figure 3. FarmBeats, an example of a data-driven agricultural platform
    from Microsoft, captures data from sensors and drones, and sends it to the Cloud
    for processing with other data streams, such as satellite data and weather stations.
    Show All Approximate processing for in-sensor analytics: A sensor network acquires
    real-world measurements at discrete points, where each measurement is a snapshot
    in time and space. In most scenarios in which sensor networks are deployed, the
    sensors are frequently queried resulting in continuously monitoring alongside
    high energy costs. Thus, one of the chief problems faced by WSN, often deployed
    in farm settings, is the constrained availability of resources to these devices.
    The sensors used in such networks are low-power embedded devices that are expected
    to last for long periods of time (order of months) on standard batteries [38].2
    This issue can be mitigated by leveraging a more distributed architecture and
    using more energy-efficient algorithms. Further, these devices generate large
    volumes of data, which ideally will be processed in real time in a streaming manner
    for usable insights. As a balance between computational load and accuracy, approximate
    computing tools and techniques have become popular in several domains, e.g., computer
    vision [5], [39] and scientific computing [40]. The idea is to perform approximate
    computation over carefully chosen subsets of the entire input dataset. In digital
    agriculture, some degree of approximation or error in the output of the algorithm
    is tolerable, either because humans cannot perceive these differences or downstream
    algorithms are not affected by such approximations. Relevant to our discussion,
    an example is the approximate computation can relay whether a particular soil
    nutrient concentration is above or below a threshold, rather than the exact value
    of it. Also, it may compute this over a uniform random subsample of say one in
    every 10 samples. Alternately, we can also use information theory principles,
    such as the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to decide on the spacing of the sensors
    in the WSN [41] and also the actual redundancy needed for robust sampling from
    sensors [42]. An important requirement of our target applications is low latency.
    This can be achieved by using multiple nodes to parallelize the work. However,
    this has to be done carefully so that the load is approximately balanced and there
    is not much overhead of energy to perform the distribution. For example, ApproxIOT
    [43] proposes an algorithm based on Apache Kafka [44] that uses IoT devices to
    generate data and forward it to edge computers, managed by service providers.
    As shown in Fig. 2, wireless communication, like LoRa/NBIoT, is used to forward
    data, compressed or otherwise, to the edge devices. These data streams are then
    sampled and forwarded to a central location (compute server C 1 in the figure),
    where user-specific queries can be made. The sampling in such systems are based
    on two techniques: Stratified Sampling: The streams of data are categorized based
    on their distribution. A random sampling is done on these distributions, with
    prior knowledge of the data required for this kind of sampling. Reservoir Sampling:
    A reservoir size R is maintained and at most R items are uniformly sampled from
    the data set. Here, prior knowledge of the data is not required. ApproxIOT extends
    both these techniques to a weighted hierarchical sampling. The nodes conduct sampling
    over data generated and compute statistics, with a 1.3X – 10X speedup. In-sensor
    analytics is relevant to our domain because it means that the data being sensed
    will be (partially) analyzed locally at the sensor itself. The value proposition
    is that raw data will not have to be sent over the wireless network, thus saving
    on wireless bandwidth and energy, and thus potentially yielding low-latency decisions.
    In-sensor analytics algorithms can either be value tolerant, where the approximation
    of values can be made and the resulting algorithms are lightweight or they can
    be delay tolerant, where the resulting algorithms can be made more accurate at
    the expense of latency. SERENE [45] is a framework that selects representative
    nodes, among clusters of correlated sensors. Here, the framework also takes into
    account the dynamic changes in the network topology and outliers. Since sensor
    data acquisition and communication are energy intensive, and sensors are typically
    battery-powered, SERENE uses clustering algorithms to spatially and temporally
    aggregate the data. For example, it uses a density-based clustering algorithm,
    DBSCAN [46] for robustness against outliers and noise. This algorithm can cluster
    based on any shape, as the sensor readings may be correlated. Based on the cluster
    shape, availability of battery power, and distance of the target node from other
    nodes, the representative nodes — M -sensors— are queried. Another lightweight
    approach for in-sensor analytics is Snapshot Queries [47]. Here the representative
    nodes are elected through a localized process. Each node maintains a data distribution
    model of its neighboring nodes. Based on this model, the algorithm predicts the
    values of the neighboring nodes. If the error between the predicted and actual
    value is less than a threshold, the predicting node can represent the neighboring
    node in question. The data model maintained is based on the previous correlation
    between the values of the node and its neighbors. Here, the model is updated frequently,
    making it robust to dynamic network changes. Another work that leverages the correlation
    between sensor values is Kartakis et al. [48] where they use this property to
    detect anomalies with a Kalman filter to reduce false positives. Distributed neural
    network inferencing: The concept of lightweight algorithms can also be extended
    to deep neural networks. Distributed Deep Neural Networks (DDNNs) provide better
    scalability and fault tolerance than DNNs. The data generated by sensor nodes
    is processed locally at the edge. DDNNs are used to utilize the advantages of
    distributed computing hierarchy in DNNs [49]. Further, simple ANNs have been used
    in tandem with Bayesian loops to reduce the number of hyperparamters in models
    and thus improve the interpretability of models and decrease the need for additional
    hyperparameter tuning. Having a multitude of hyperparameters to tune is often
    an overkill for simpler processing needs with energy considerations in mind, as
    is often the case for lightweight edge processing for sensor node analytics [50].
    This and other approaches, such as Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), sped up using
    hardware accelerators, can be a panacea when data volume is limited (as in cases
    where sensor nodes have been initialized on a farm) and to prevent overfitting
    plus allow for limited memory footprint [51]. Limited memory space may be the
    case for microcontroller-class devices or lower-resourced edge-class devices used
    in sensor nodes or gateway nodes, where memory is of the order of a few GBs rather
    than 100 s of GBs at server-class machines. Another aspect to reduce the energy
    consumption of sensor nodes is by reducing the duty cycles (sleep-wake cycling)
    of sensors. By activating the sensors only when required, the energy consumed
    by the sensors will be reduced. In our target domain, this is highly feasible
    since the sensing frequency can be kept low (of the order of a few minutes) due
    to the nature of the underlying events being sensed. Database management and backend
    analytics for large-scale agricultural sensor data: Precision agriculture allows
    for site-specific crop management to increase throughput and achieve more sustainable
    farming by applying data science to agriculture practices, learning from local
    data trends. More and more agricultural sensing data is being live-streamed from
    farms, whether it be through on-board cameras, on manned or unmanned aerial vehicles,
    or through ground sensors in the farms. There is thus a need for centralized databases
    to store and process these data sets, often in real-time, to get actionable insights
    for farmers. Plus, there may be some degree of federation in storage and compute
    resources that may be needed as the computing needs of this domain increases,
    as has been seen in the genomics domain [6]. Further, the sensing data is multi-dimensional
    and noisy, coming from ground sensors deployed in farms to measure an array of
    soil characteristics, such as, moisture, nutrient levels, temperature profiles,
    soil acidity, etc. These live-streamed data sets need to be stored in a fail-safe
    repository of nodes, such as Redis installations in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [52]. Redis is a popular NoSQL datastore that is being
    currently used by Twitter, Instagram, Microsoft, Groupon, etc. It is an in-memory
    key-value store that supports various abstract data structures, such as strings,
    lists, maps, etc. By storing the data in the main memory, Redis serves as both
    a datastore and a cache. This allows for a very fast and flexible storage model,
    which is essential for real-time processing pipelines, such as in digitized agriculture
    pipelines, e.g., FarmBeats [53]. Moreover, Redis supports durability by periodically
    saving a snapshot of its main memory to the permanent storage. This snapshot can
    be loaded back into main memory in the case of a failure. The aggregate live-streamed
    updates and queries represent a unique workload for such NoSQL datastores, as
    these queries vary in rate and type over time. In such cases, a workload-aware
    tuning system is needed to reconfigure the NoSQL cluster, whether locally or on
    the cloud, to provide high performance. This is becoming more important as the
    data from small-scale farms across the country is burgeoning both in size and
    diversity, slowly replacing the previously used manual data-collection processes.
    Maximizing the throughput of these processing pipelines of digital farm data will
    enable actionable insights from agricultural sensing data. Also, given that these
    pipelines are hosted on the cloud and this domain is very cost conscious, we want
    to maximize the performance within a user-defined cost bound. Our recent work
    on cost-aware optimization of NoSQL database has shown promise [17], [18]. A pipeline
    for analytical workloads (OLAP, online analytical processing) consists of two
    main parts: a storage cluster (e.g., Redis or Cassandra) and a computing cluster
    (e.g., Spark), the latter operates on the top of the storage cluster to execute
    queries and thus perform analysis on the stored data. The task of the optimization
    is to find the best combination of configurations maximizing the objective metric,
    modeled as: P ∗ = arg max Confs f(Confs(t),WL(t)) (1) View Source Where P ∗ is
    the optimal performance that is achieved by the best combination of configurations
    Confs . The search space of Confs is large, e.g., NoSQL databases, e.g., Cassandra
    and Redis, have 50+ and 40+ performance-sensitive parameters, respectively. Hence,
    an exhaustive search through all possible configurations is impractical. Therefore,
    evolutionary search techniques are preferred in this case due to their ability
    to find close-to-optimal solutions in practical time, e.g., 1. Experimental Evaluation:
    We perform our experiments on multi-modal sensor data, mimicked on real data collected
    from our experimental digital agriculture farms. First, we identified the most
    impactful NoSQL parameters for our agricultural processing pipeline. We use D-optimal
    design to specify the data points to collect to reveal these impactful parameters.
    We collect 128 data points. These data points represent different combinations
    of configuration parameters and their corresponding performance (in terms of throughput,
    i.e., Operations/s or Ops/s). Second, we use the collected data points to train
    and test our performance prediction model. We estimate the importance of each
    feature and select the most impactful parameters (Fig. 4). We then use these top-
    k impactful parameters in training our model. Figure 4. Feature importance for
    accurate performance prediction. Show All Performance prediction model training:
    In this experiment, we study the impact of using an ensemble of predictors on
    the prediction accuracy. Ensemble of predictors can achieve better bias–variance
    tradeoff than a single predictor by combining the predictions of many predictors.
    Each predictor in the ensemble is trained with 75% random sampling of the training
    data. This sampling step is repeated for every model, which increases the diversity
    of the models and hence improve the prediction accuracy of their combined results.
    As shown in Fig. 5, a single DNN shows a very poor prediction performance with
    an R-squared value of 0.16 and an RMSE of 5671. However, a significant improvement
    is observed when we combine the predictions (by taking the average) of 5 or more
    models. We notice that there is a diminishing improvement in the performance prediction
    (for both metrics) after increasing the size of the ensemble beyond N = 15. Figure
    5. Improved performance with increasing ensemble size. Show All We evaluate three
    possible single server prediction models for evaluating the prediction of throughput
    for NoSQL databases such as Redis and Cassandra. The prediction is done for different
    configurations of the NoSQL DB as well as the cloud VM on which the VM is hosted.
    In each case, we use a Random Forest using 75%:25% for training and prediction.
    1) N-Solitary-Models: This builds a separate prediction model per VM instance
    type (referred to as “architecture”). It predicts the performance of a given architecture/configuration
    combination using previously collected data points from the same architecture.
    Thus, there is no scope for transfer learning here. 2) Combined-Categorical: This
    builds a combined model using all points from all architectures, while it represents
    the architecture as a categorical parameter (with integral values). Thus, knowledge
    transfer is limited across architectures, e.g., C4.large to C4.xlarge, for AWS
    VM instances. 3) Combined-Numerical: This also builds a combined model for all
    architectures. However, it describes the architecture in terms of its resources
    e.g., C4.large is represented as vCPU 8, RAM 3.75 GB, Network-Bandwidth 0.62 Gbits/s.
    This model allows extrapolation across all VM architectures, even across cloud
    vendors. We test the accuracy of each predictor using the same number of data
    points (100 points per architecture) and show the result in terms of R 2 (Table
    1). We see that using a separate model per architecture (N-Solitary Models) gives
    poor performance due to the lack of knowledge transfer between architectures.
    Further, the numerical representation shows a significant improvement in prediction
    performance over categorical from better knowledge transfer across architectures.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Single-Server Prediction Techniques. OptimusCloud,
    Which is Our Cloud-Based Optimization Technique Achieves Better Performance in
    Terms of R 2 and RMSE Over All Baselines Interpretable and interoperable data
    analytics: Although there are several predictive models, it is important that
    the analysis be interpretable. Molnar et al. [54] explains the importance of interpretable
    ML. This could help clients better understand why a model is predicting a certain
    intervention for crop growth. Vellido, Martín-Guerrero, and Lisboa [55] provides
    an overview of several works that address the issue of making ML techniques more
    interpretable. Dimensionality reduction is a popular choice here. A comparison
    of such existing techniques is provided in [56]. After dimensionality reduction,
    it becomes tractable to rank order the different features by their importance,
    providing insights [57]. Another aspect of interpretability is to resolve post-hoc
    “sanity check” questions [58], such as, after a rain event, does the model predict
    the moisture content in the soil is higher. If the model fails to answer correctly
    a sanity-check question, then further examination of the model is done. An important
    aspect of interpretability is to allow domain experts to parametrize the models,
    e.g., by feeding the appropriate parameter values for different regions of operation.
    This can be fed in as manual input by experts or by blending simulation models
    (typically built by experts) into the data analytics models. Another important
    design consideration is interoperability of the software systems used to acquire
    and analyze data. Too often software vendors provide silo-ed software packages
    either due to lack of design consideration or due to conscious decision to force
    vendor lock-in. In all such cases, it becomes a burden, often insurmountable,
    to make them interoperate [59]. SECTION V. Edge Computing and Low-Power Communication
    Technologies Here we discuss recent developments in edge computing and low-power
    communication technologies that aid our use domain. Edge computing is rapidly
    evolving, so it is timely to consider the lessons that can be learned and further
    customized for digital agriculture. The use of low-power communication is a common
    requirement in several domains. However, our target domain places some distinctive
    requirements and opportunities that we discuss next. Microservices and edge-cloud
    partitioning for low-latency communications: The world of connected devices has
    fueled the IoT era, where applications rely on a multitude of devices aggregating
    and processing data sets across highly heterogeneous networks. In this context,
    distributed deployment alongside containerization of the different information
    channels will shield the systems from isolated failures, conferring resiliency.
    The other important aspect is the partitioning of the data stream for computing
    at different degrees of latency—computing nodes at the edge are used for user-facing
    applications (face recognition, reconnaissance from a video stream, etc.). Owners
    will react negatively if the computers become unusable due to intermittent edge
    analytics. Therefore, the prioritization of the processes needs to change dynamically.
    In contrast, the application itself needs to be designed in a way that it is insensitive
    to such dynamic, and unpredictable, changes to the priority level, e.g., it will
    not time out if there are client-server interactions. Another aspect of the prioritization
    is that the different analytics results are needed with vastly differing timing
    requirements. Such high-level, user-expressed requirements will be used to dynamically
    prioritize in the face of unpredictable arrivals of the events (e.g., a flash
    flood event, or onset of a locust infestation). Thus, overall the partitioning
    needs to happen in a top-down or bottom-up manner. Top-down means that we take
    the high-level user requirements on latency and accuracy and define the partitioning
    based on that. Bottom-up means that depending on the available resources on each
    platform, the resource handler decides where to run the application component.
    Top-down requirements naturally have a higher priority. This will leverage the
    significant amount of work that has been done in automatic partitioning of applications
    to run on mobile devices and the cloud [60]–[64]. In-network processing: Sensors
    used in precision agriculture are Internet of Things or IoT devices and like all
    IoT devices have constraints on power and connectivity. It is necessary to have
    the first step of data processing that takes place at the sensor end to be energy
    efficient. Thus, anomalous data can be suppressed and need not be communicated.
    Alternately, in some scenarios, the exact opposite is desired—when an anomalous
    event is detected, that event needs to be communicated to the gateway promptly.
    AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is used for fitting time-series
    data in order to predict or estimate the trend. This can then be used for suppressing
    data communication — if the sensor node and the receiving gateway node use the
    same model to predict values and the predicted value is close to the sensed value,
    the sensor node can suppress the communication [65], [66]. While ARIMA models
    work on a linear process, more sophisticated ML algorithms can model non-linear
    processes. Examples of traditional ML techniques such as k -Nearest Neighbors
    (KNNs) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) as well as more complex Recurring Neural
    Networks (RNNs) [67] and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) [68] have
    been used for prediction of sensor network values [69], [70]. The predicted values
    can again be used for suppression of redundant data communication. The tunable
    configuration allows us to navigate the tradeoff space between accuracy and data
    communication. While RNNs and LSTMs give more accurate prediction over statistical
    methods like ARIMA and ETS, they are more complex in nature. For simpler user
    queries and in-sensor analytics, ARIMA and ETS models can be used as a lightweight
    alternative. A more detailed analysis can be done on the cloud backend with some
    context achieved through attention pooling for example. Low-power communication
    technologies Low-power communication for wireless IoT communication is key for
    digital agriculture and falls in three broad categories: Low-power wide area networks
    (LPWAN), with a greater than 1 km range, essentially low-power versions of cellular
    networks, with each “node” covering thousands of end devices. Examples include
    LoRaWAN, Sigfox, DASH7, and weightless. Wireless personal area networks (WPAN),
    typically ranging from 10 to a few 100 meters. Examples include Bluetooth and
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ANT, and ZigBee, which are applicable directly in
    short-range personal area networks or if organized as mesh networks and with higher
    transmit power, larger coverage areas. Cellular solution of IoT, including any
    protocol that are reliant on the cellular connection Some of the bottlenecks in
    wireless transmission in farm settings include the harsh physical conditions in
    farm settings and the proliferation of inexpensive and less reliable sensors coupled
    with the intrinsic challenges of the LoRaWAN and cellular network technologies,
    such as 5 G. The core problem in farm settings is to acquire and transfer disparate
    data sources to support the various demands of a wide range of computation tasks
    while meeting the stringent constraints of heterogeneous wireless connectivity
    available in agricultural domain (especially for the livestock application). Data
    traffic from different sources and for distinct computation tasks raise diverse
    requirements to wireless connectivity in terms of its availability, bandwidth,
    responsiveness, resilience and energy efficiency. For example, sparse data relating
    behavior changes needs highly responsive, highly reliable communication; streaming
    videos captured by the drones3 or surveillance cameras expects high bandwidth
    but is elastic to varying-bandwidth with appropriate rate adaptation; A large
    amount of livestock herd-level information can be delay-tolerant but requires
    energy-efficient connectivity. Further, compared to wireless networks in the urban
    and civil uses, wireless networking for the livestock experiences more practical
    challenges regarding coverage holes, fast-fading channels, high interference and
    time-varying performance. Wireless connectivity is not always available in the
    wild rural areas: WiFi or other local-area communication (white space, ZigBee,
    LoRA) to the edge is unavailable when the cattle is far away from the farm facility,
    and cellular connectivity is missing at places given the poor coverage in the
    countryside. In most operational large-scale farms in the US, WiFi connectivity
    is not present. While cellular providers in the US do provide cellular plans for
    IoT devices (prominently NB-IoT), the cost of such plans makes them infeasible
    for farms, considering that the cost is per device and we anticipate many IoT
    devices in a large-scale farm. Hence, the use of LoRa, and its variants LoRaMesh
    or LoRaWAN, is popular. The IoT orchestrators that are provided by Microsoft,
    Amazon, and Google, i.e., Microsoft Azure IoT, AWS IoT Greengrass Greengrass,
    and Google IoT Core, can also leverage any of these networking modalities. However,
    Azure IoT uses a hybrid of per-device and data-based pricing system and AWS Greengrass
    uses a per-device pricing system, while Google''s IoT Core uses a pricing system
    based on data volume alone. Thus, all existing commercial edge-based orchestrators
    need additional operational costs to function. So using a non-metered network
    like LoRa and using homegrown orchestration software will avoid these additional
    charges. A suite of techniques for data acquisition and wireless networking must
    work in concert, and at a price-point, to meet the diverse demands in digital
    agriculture. Agricultural data types relevant to algorithmic design: It is important
    to set up the data architecture prior to ingestion of the data. A broad and yet
    useful principle relates to the FAIR data principles, which refer to the Findability,
    Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. This is particularly
    important as in this domain there is close interaction between man and machine
    throughout the data pipeline. Now let us consider the primary types of data as
    they relate to our theme here. Batch Data mainly includes information collected
    from sensing devices, such as information of cropping, feeding, waste, livestock,
    etc. As the data is often sparse in time and space, it has a loose synchronization
    requirement and does not require a continuous wireless connectivity. Therefore,
    batch data can be periodically recorded and asynchronously updated. The main limitation
    for sensing devices is that they are usually battery powered and have limited
    operational lifetime. An optimized device management and transmission protocol
    is quite essential for energy efficient data acquisition and transmission, device
    lifetime maximization and sustainable development of the livestock system. Streaming
    Data is usually dynamic video/audio recoded by surveillance cameras or drones
    for real-time monitoring and early anomaly detection. Such data, especially for
    real-time monitoring, analytics and diagnosis is time sensitive and demands a
    continuous high-volume bandwidth for intensive content storage and delivery. A
    joint procedure of data acquisition and transmission is thus required to adapt
    the high data volume, handle varying wireless conditions, and support a reliable
    information flow. Multi-class data acquisition, storage, and processing: We consider
    two main classes: delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant. Delay-sensitive data is
    used for real-time monitoring, early anomaly detection and other highly-responsive
    tasks. It is further divided into multiple sub-classes depending on their bandwidth
    requirement: continuous high bandwidth (e.g., streaming videos recorded by the
    cameras or drones), continuous low bandwidth (e.g, streaming audio/voice, GPS
    or other in-cattle sensing data), or instantaneously-available but short connectivity
    (e.g., information like critical alarms). Delay-tolerant data is used for strategic
    tasks and includes sensing data collected for cropping, feeding, waste, livestock,
    etc. For different classes of data, we propose to develop a suite of techniques:
    1) task-aware sampling schemes to reduce data volumes but retain data samples
    essential to the computation tasks, 2) content-aware data aggregation and compression
    to eliminate statistical redundancy and adjust data volume to fit the dynamic
    channel capacity and varying wireless condition (e.g., content-aware video frame
    compression). Integrated network over heterogeneous wireless communication: We
    have designed an integrated network to enable both delay-sensitive communication
    and delay-tolerant communication (in an opportunistic manner) over heterogeneous
    wireless connectivity [8]. We consider both infrastructure-based and ad hoc modes.
    Hybrid mode is also designed for whereby data resides at a location till infrastructure
    becomes available such as a drone as a data ferry. Network adaptation needs to
    be performed at multiple levels spanning from wireless technologies (e.g., cellular,
    cellular-IoT, WiFi, ZigBee, LoRA etc), transport layer (MPTCP, delay-driven optimization),
    lower-layer techniques like resource allocation, scheduling and rate adaption,
    to name a few. Many techniques can be modified at runtime to further optimize
    data acquisition and transmission under time-varying conditions. These include
    predictive optimization based on time varying wireless connectivity and data requirements
    and joint optimization of local storage, local processing, and wirelesss transmissions.
    SECTION VI. Economics, Policy, and Decision Making The most relevant policy questions
    in digital agriculture and related business data and are summarized in Fig. 6.
    Though farm data enjoy some of the IP protections afforded to trade secrets, its
    legal ownership remains ambiguous [71]. The decision to subscribe to a data service
    provider stem from fears of personally identifiable information (PII) being misappropriated.
    Yet, farm data generates positive network externalities when aggregated across
    a large number of operations. Figure 6. Farm economic decision making pipeline
    and barriers to profitability in digital agriculture. Show All Profitability and
    on-farm decision making: Site-specific farm management has the potential to enhance
    farm profitability while conserving resources. But despite advancements in field
    sensors, GPS guidance, and grid soil sampling, adoption by farmer operators has
    fallen short of expectations. Operator demographics, operation size, and perceived
    benefits influence the decision to invest in site-specific management practices.
    Subsequent economic returns to adoption depend on the nature of the adopted technology
    and its interface with on-farm decision making. Miller et al. [72] identify two
    types of precision agriculture technologies: embodied knowledge—tools that generate
    value in isolation, e.g., GPS guidance systems or automatic section control— and
    information intensive—tools that produce data for use in future decision making
    such as yield monitors, grid soil sampling, or electrochemical sensors. Embodied
    knowledge technologies create immediate convenience while the benefits of information-intensive
    technologies are revealed over a longer time horizon and depend on their role
    in the on-farm decision making process. Differences in the immediacy and measurability
    of realized gains may explain differences in adoption rates across technology
    types. Use of VRT and GPS soil mapping, for example, has consistently lagged that
    of GPS guidance systems. Rather than assessing technologies in isolation, agricultural
    economists are increasingly interested in how producers bundle complementary tools
    to create an overall precision technology strategy. Profitable use of “hard technologies”
    such as variable rate planters and fertilizer spreaders depends crucially on the
    availability of accurate intra-field soil data, or “soft technology” inputs [1].
    These data sources however, are themselves costly to obtain. Moreover, the optimal
    data collection frequency or sampling density is not obvious and likely varies
    by field. Unless the economic returns to site-specific management cover both the
    up-front investment and the cost of collecting and using actionable information,
    adoption will be low. Policy: The most relevant policy questions in digital agriculture
    regard the value and legal status of farm data. Agricultural data generates benefits
    when aggregated across a large number of farm operations. These benefits—referred
    to as network effects or network externalities—grow with the number of participants.
    Business models such as Farmers Business Network, Inc. (FBN) have demonstrated
    the value of data sharing through its crowd-sourced database of input costs and
    performance benchmarking. But farm data often remains siloed within the farm gate.
    An individual farm''s data leads to more reliable recommendations when pooled
    with comparable operations using similar practices and inputs. To overcome this
    “small data” problem, the perceived benefits of joining a big data community must
    exceed the perceived costs—e.g., privacy concerns over data misappropriation.
    To better understand the privacy concerns of producers, the nature and legal status
    of agricultural data must be considered. Miller et al. [71] discuss farm data''s
    place on the private-public good spectrum. For a good to be a “private good,”
    i.e., its benefits and costs are fully realized by the owner, it must be both
    rivalrous—consumption by one party prohibits the consumption of another—and excludable—access
    to the good can be restricted. A private good allows for the highest possible
    degree of privacy protections for the owner. Copies of farm data can be shared
    without inhibiting its use by the original owner. In this way, farm data is clearly
    non-rivalrous. The ability of a farm operator to exclude others from using their
    data depends on their relationships with data service providers and the data sharing
    agreements that govern those relationships. For example, equipment manufacturers
    collect telematics data on new products they sell for improving performance and
    service. The equipment owner has no reasonable expectation of excludability and
    may not even be aware that they opted into such an agreement. Farms that subscribe
    to a data service provider to manage and analyze their data, e.g., Climate FieldView,
    are similarly forfeiting excludability. However, data may be partially excludable
    if access is limited to the network, or “club” of subscribers. Farm data most
    closely satisfies the definition of a “club good”, meaning the degree to which
    a farmer''s privacy is at risk depends on how extensive and excludable their data
    network is [71]. A farmer''s data is not legally protected from disclosure in
    the way medical records are protected by the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act (HIPAA) or education information is protected by the Family
    Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Without overarching legal safeguards
    for farm data, individual sharing agreements dictate the terms of access and use.
    Though farm data enjoy some of the intellectual property protections afforded
    to trade secrets, its legal ownership structure remains ambiguous. There may be
    a role for liability insurance that addresses unintended consequences of information
    sharing. Over large regions, such data might be reported on a non-attributional
    basis, thus shielding specific individuals. The flip side of this is that this
    reduces the precision of mitigation actions, e.g., for a specific geographical
    region. Possible solutions to the conundrum might consider cryptography coupled
    to access keys, facilitating access to large databases, without revealing specific
    information to those who do not hold keys. Keys could be made available based
    on a regional user group, and to those who contributed to the database. For further
    sophisticated use cases, secure multi-party computation can be used, allowing
    a group of members of a minimum size coming together to access the information,
    but individuals or smaller-sized groups cannot. For example, homomorphic encryption
    in federated computing serves this purpose of balancing privacy and data utility.
    SECTION VII. Looking Ahead Big data and precision agriculture will likely be a
    disruptive force in the farm economy over the medium to long-term range. Digital
    agriculture, with the incorporation of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based technologies,
    presents the ability to evaluate a system at multiple levels (individual, local,
    regional, and global) and generate tools that allow for improved decision making
    in every sub-process related to digital agriculture. In this article, we have
    reviewed the different types of datasets and relevant data science processing
    algorithms in typical field operations together with the typical lifecycle for
    the data to be contributory to the digital farm economy. We have then discussed
    the optimized NoSQL-based data storage solutions. Then, we have developed the
    idea of Machine Learning being adapted for use in digital agriculture, which means
    putting domain-specific requirements regarding interpretability, distribution,
    ability to handle intermittent wireless connectivity, and low cost. Finally, we
    have reported on results from real-world data from real-world testbeds with respect
    to which features are important in the analytics and the performance of analytics-based
    prediction. We conclude by discussing the policy challenges, the farm economic
    decision making pipeline, and barriers to profitability in digital agriculture.

    \ (IoT) is bringing innovations in almost every ﬁeld\nof science. IoT is mainly\
    \ focused on the connectivity of things via the Internet. IoT’s integration tools\n\
    are developed based on the Do It Yourself (DIY) approach, as the general public\
    \ lacks technical\nskills. This paper presents a thermal comfort system based\
    \ on tasks allocation mechanism in\nsmart homes. This paper designs and implements\
    \ the tasks allocation mechanism based on virtual\nobjects composition for IoT\
    \ applications. We provide user-friendly drag and drops panels for\nthe new IoT\
    \ users to visualize both task composition and device virtualization. This paper\
    \ also\ndesigns tasks generation from microservices, tasks mapping, task scheduling,\
    \ and tasks allocation\nfor thermal comfort applications in smart home. Microservices\
    \ are functional units of services in\nan IoT environment. Physical devices are\
    \ registered, and their corresponding virtual objects are\ninitialized. Tasks\
    \ are generated from the microservices and connected with the relevant virtual\
    \ objects.\nAfterward, they are scheduled and ﬁnally allocated on the physical\
    \ IoT device. The task composition\ntoolbox is deployed on the cloud for users\
    \ to access the application remotely. The performance of\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is evaluated using both real-time and simulated scenarios. Round trip\ntime\
    \ (RTT), response time, task dropping and latency are used as the performance\
    \ metrics. Results\nindicate that even for worst-case scenarios, values of these\
    \ metrics are negligible, which makes our\narchitecture signiﬁcant, better and\
    \ ideal for task allocation in IoT network.\nKeywords:\nInternet of Things; Do-It-Yourself;\

    \ Introduction\nServices provided through the world wide web (WWW) serve as a\
    \ medium for people to create,\ninnovate and share their work with others. The\
    \ Internet enables the reuse of other’s work as a\ncornerstone for smart and useful\
    \ things creation. The Internet medium plays a vital role in the\nrealization\
    \ of IoT [1]. The recent trend in the IoT is bringing innovations in almost every\
    \ ﬁeld of life [2].\nHardware boards are electronic modules; IoT users can combine\
    \ these modules to develop their custom\nIoT applications based on smarter things.\
    \ Some of the most popular boards are Adafruit Flora [3],\nArduino [4], Intel\
    \ Edison [5], and Raspberry Pi [6]. Most of the manufacturers of these boards\
    \ provide\nAPI and coding documentation for the programming languages supported\
    \ by its environment; many\nof these boards support programming languages such\
    \ as Python and Java. Users with the necessary\nskills of its supported languages\
    \ can start creating IoT applications by customizing the existing code\nfor these\
    \ boards.\nIn the IoT network sensors, actuators are the most used vital nodes;\
    \ other important key nodes\nare smart objects, RFID tags, and servers. These\
    \ nodes can perform a minimal amount of tasks as they\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 5849; doi:10.3390/su11205849\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5849\n2 of 24\nare different from each other in capabilities such\
    \ as power consumption, residual energy, available\nmemory, and processing capacity\
    \ [7]. In order to perform some given IoT application tasks, these\nnodes must\
    \ have capability of reconﬁguring themselves and interoperate autonomously. Powerful\n\
    IoT applications require different IoT nodes to collaborate for performing a speciﬁc\
    \ task; all of these\ntasks performed by a node or more than one nodes brings\
    \ to the most diverse applications. Examples\ninclude IoT applications in smart\
    \ house, Agriculture and Healthcare. Furthermore, technologies trends\nshowings\
    \ that in future, more complex applications will be developed by integrating IoT\
    \ and Artiﬁcial\nintelligence, and other ﬁelds’ knowledge together. e.g., Machine\
    \ to Machine (M2M) communication,\ni.e., smart cars and smart vehicles sharing\
    \ critical information such as trafﬁc congestion and accident\nlocations to ambulances.\n\
    Human psychology has various drivers toward the DIY approach. Usability and Innovations\n\
    of today’s DIY architectures enable new users to do creative things in a simple,\
    \ easy way. In the IoT\nﬁeld, one of the motivations for applying DIY approaches\
    \ is the advancement in development Kits\nsuch as Arduino, Grove* and Raspberry\
    \ Pi. Today’s IoT research is mainly focused on technologies\nand research methodologies\
    \ for enabling the connectivity of things to the Internet intelligently and\n\
    efﬁciently. These innovations and research in IoT, particularly in DIY architectures\
    \ making the general\npublic involved in the extension of these technologies to\
    \ other ﬁelds of science. Therefore, DIY\narchitecture and toolkits are essential\
    \ for future IoT advancements. New users cannot understand\nmany important contents\
    \ easily if architecture is not following usability and other ease of use matrices.\n\
    Hence, one of the goals of this research is to provide a solution to the task\
    \ allocation problem using a\nDIY approach focused on user usability and reliability\
    \ factors.\nIn this paper, we propose a tasks allocation mechanism for thermal\
    \ comfort in smart homes. The\nprocess is based on task-based managemnt that includes\
    \ from microservice analysis to task allocation\non physical devices. Microservices\
    \ are used for the generation of Tasks in the IoT environment. These\ngenerated\
    \ tasks are directly associated with IoT resources such as sensors or actuators.\
    \ A task is\nassociated with a device commonly known as task mapping [8]. Task\
    \ scheduling is changing the\norder of these pairs such that tasks that need to\
    \ be executed ﬁrst are executed ﬁrst and vice versa.\nTask allocation is the process\
    \ of assigning a task to a physical device and allocating a time slot to the\n\
    task. Task deployment is the execution of tasks on the physical device at the\
    \ allocated time. The IoT\norchestration architecture we propose provides effective\
    \ task allocation on physical IoT devices full\nﬁling basic requirements of the\
    \ user and avoid the excess use of constrained resources.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the related work, highlighting\n\
    the contribution to IoT integration architectures. In Section 3, the proposed\
    \ methods for Task and\nVirtual Objects Composition are discussed; Section 4 explains\
    \ the design of the proposed architecture;\nImplementation and results are discussed\
    \ in Section 5. Performance analysis and signiﬁcance of the\nproposed architecture\
    \ is discussed in Section 6; Section 7 concludes the research study and discusses\n\
    future work direction.\n2. Related Work\nThe IoT vision is the connectivity of\
    \ smart objects that can be deployed in any space to provide\nservices to people.\
    \ In order for good user experience, users difﬁculties in the use of IoT tools\
    \ must be\naddressed.Some of the research focuses on the DIY approach for the\
    \ development of user-friendly IoT\nplatforms; users learn visual programming-based\
    \ techniques to develop their custom IoT applications.\nPhilips company is a brand\
    \ of electronics, famous in the market for electronics products primarily\nknown\
    \ for manufacturing appliances of daily use in the home. Philips Hue is an IoT\
    \ management\nplatform For the connectivity of user’s home appliances to their\
    \ IoT smart space [9]. The dashboard\nconsiders usability and best user experience\
    \ factors allowing connectivity of home appliances to\nsmart home IoT network\
    \ in a natural way; users can also monitor the appliances remotely from\nthe IoT\
    \ management platform. This platform only focuses on the realization of IoT; scalability,\
    \ and\nmanagement issues are also not considered by this platform [10].\nSustainability\

    \ simple and easy programming. The design\nof this platform considers features\
    \ of programming language which can enlarge the IoT ecosystem;\nfeatures examples\
    \ are portability, extendibility, and high productivity. The platform should provide\
    \ a\nmechanism for secure application development by the use of high-level APIs\
    \ provided by the platform.\nSome of the functions provided by these APIs are\
    \ device management and communication between\nthese devices. This platform also\
    \ supports multiple IoT applications which means that users can install\nmultiple\
    \ applications with diverse functions. The platform also supports the concurrent\
    \ execution\nof these applications, enabling a user to take advantage of using\
    \ multiple services on a single device.\nThis software platform also enables the\
    \ communication of IoT devices with host IoT devices; also the\nhost device will\
    \ able to control the companion IoT device [11].\nGlue.things a project developed\
    \ on the core concept of device integration and real-time\ncommunication utilizing\
    \ some of the well-established open source technologies. This real-time\ncommunication\
    \ is made possible by using the web sockets’ most recent technologies, i.e., CoAP\
    \ and\nMQTT. The protocols are utilized on real-time mashups of the network data\
    \ streams, which is ﬁnally\ndeployed in a distributed environment. The proposed\
    \ system is a mechanism for the composition of\ndata streams from web services\
    \ [12]. Glue.things provides a collaboration platform with JSON data\nmodels,\
    \ REST APIs and web sockets. Node-RED inspires the mashup interface.\nNode-RED\
    \ from IBM’s is a DIY approach based ﬂow programming platform recently developed\n\
    and got popularity due to its browser-based powerful editor [13]. The goal of\
    \ the developed was to\nprovide a programming tool for wiring hardware devices\
    \ by reducing the coding effort and technicality\nfor developers. The node-red\
    \ tool enables users to wire together hardware devices visualized in\ngraphical\
    \ nodes form. The graphical nodes represent physical devices, web service, and\
    \ software\nplatforms. The hardware devices wiring approach used by Node-RED is\
    \ ﬂow programming which will\neven enable a new IoT user to participate in the\
    \ awareness of IoT in other ﬁelds. Chris Simpkin et al. [14]\nproposed mechanism\
    \ to run workﬂows like Node-Red on Edge networks, for this purpose they\ninvestigated\
    \ to ﬁnd out means of migration of Node-RED into a distributed execution environment.\n\
    The demonstration in this work shows the feasibility of such approaches, trafﬁc\
    \ congestion detection\nworkﬂow based on Node-RED is migrated into a decentralized\
    \ execution environment.\nAmong the notable contribution in open-source toolkits\
    \ for creating mainboard is Microsoft .NET\nGadgeteer [15], which use the combination\
    \ of small electronic block approach for mainboard creation.\nThis open-source\
    \ toolkit enables users to create electronic devices based on their own customization\n\
    needs; all they need is to combine small electronic blocks on circuitry for the\
    \ creation of the mainboard.\nA processor has embedded into the mainboard of Microsoft\
    \ .NET Gadgeteer. Lucio Tommaso De Paolis\net al. used an open-source platform\
    \ called Thingsboard for sensors data collection and analytics[16].\nThingboard\
    \ provides mechanisms for data collection, processing the data, providing analytics\
    \ based on\nrule engine. The visualization module is embedded with more than 30\
    \ widgets to visualize a complete\nIoT smart space.\nAmong the notable projects\
    \ from Kickstarter [17] is SAM [18]. SAM does not need any expertise\nin the ﬁeld\
    \ and can be exploited equally by new users as well as expert developers. The\
    \ approach\nused is combining electronics modules blocks, all these modules are\
    \ wireless, which is a cornerstone\nfor innovation, creation, and designs. The\
    \ mechanism followed by SAM is using the internet with a\ncombination of hardware\
    \ and software to a project. The programming language used for SAM toolkit\nis\
    \ the python.\nMazzei et al. [19] further investigate how customizability will\
    \ enable general mass involvement in\nthe creation of such products that can contribute\
    \ to the IoT ecosystem. In literature, some other studies\nused the same idea;\
    \ In the case of Feki et al. research study [20], DIY approach is considered among\n\
    the most trending approach in the future for the development in the IoT ﬁeld.\
    \ Low-cost Systems on\nChip (SoC) based IoT development following the DIY approach\
    \ is proposed by the research study of\nScott and Chin [21].\nSustainability 2019,\

    \ on the visual development paradigm.\nThese tools are visual development based\
    \ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the\ndevelopment of IoT application\
    \ and manage its life cycle. A minimal programming approach is\nused in the development\
    \ of IoT applications based on semantic IoT architecture. Users model services\n\
    into graphs in a node-based user interface, which are then converted into SPARQL\
    \ queries.\nIoT applications development in the form of real-time data streams\
    \ is provided by an IoT platform\ncalled Super Stream Collider (SSC) [23]. This\
    \ platform will enable everyone from new IoT users to\nan expert to develop custom\
    \ IoT applications. SSC web-based interface enables users to develop\napplications\
    \ for various IoT scenarios by combining linked streams and data sources to IoT\
    \ resources.\nFor SSC support editor based SPARQL/CQELS query languages; the approach\
    \ used is simple drag\nand drop. The platform exploits cloud infrastructure for\
    \ massive data acquisition, processing, and\nspreading of the data.\nIoT is now\
    \ applicable in agriculture, how to bring innovations in agriculture using IoT\
    \ is studied\nin a ﬁeld called digital agriculture. Recently DIY approach based\
    \ IoT application was developed for\ndigital agriculture. Jayaraman et al. [24]\
    \ discuss such digital agriculture applications which will make\nnaive users monitor\
    \ the growth of the crop in a form, suggests and support the user with irrigation\n\
    decisions. They discuss a user interface called Phenonet, which is a zero-programming\
    \ based novel\nDIY architecture. The efﬁciency of this Open IoT platform is evaluated\
    \ through Phenonet and other\nseveral use cases.\nIn the examples of services\
    \ for data feeds collection, Pachube [25] is a notable web-centric service.\n\
    Pachube store information related to various sensors devices and the data feeds\
    \ provided by these\ndevices over some time. Pachube work on the idea of \"triggers,\
    \ it is capable of data integration,\nprocessing, and visualization. The data\
    \ arrival from hardware or software resources can be deﬁned\nas a trigger. The\
    \ response to such trigger is forwarding of the data to particular URL based on\
    \ rules\ndeﬁned by Pachube, triggering some other relevant triggers. Pachube increases\
    \ the creativity and\ndevelopment by provides a medium for sharing the feeds triggered\
    \ or integrated by one user can be\nused by another user.\nM. S. Khan et al. [26]\

    \ services based on CoAP proxy. The CoAP proxy Communication with the server device\
    \ is\ndone through CoAP proxy using socket connection. All the details are handled\
    \ by improved service\ncomposition toolkit. The toolkit visual interface enables\
    \ a beginner user to compose IoT services. User\nregisters and combines virtual\
    \ objects for physical devices through the drag and drops approach.\nShabir et\
    \ al. [27] present a DIY based service designer with a zero-programming experience.\n\
    Node-RED inspires the concept of the research study, the functionalities provided\
    \ by remote and CoAP\ndevices can be easily customized. Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF) [28] has standardized CoAP\nis communication protocols for devices\
    \ having scarce resources. The CoAP server is implemented\nusing the Intel Edison\
    \ board. The platform was chosen due to growth in its acceptance day by day\n\
    in the DIY community all over the world. Visual service designers access the CoAP\
    \ resources via\nCoAP proxy shared by the CoAP server. The proxy implementation\
    \ is based on the Californium [29]\nframework in a programming language called\
    \ a Java. For storing the conﬁguration, they use a novel\napproach based on the\
    \ repository at the cloud. This cloud-based platform ensures the availability\
    \ of\nthese conﬁgurations everywhere. The HTTP protocol is used to handle communication\
    \ between real\ndevices and the DIY toolbox, whereas CoAP protocol is used to\
    \ handle communication between the\nDIY toolbox and cloud.\nIn literature, we\
    \ found some AI-based Intelligent solutions for service composition in the IoT\n\
    environment. Some AI algorithms are used for virtual object management and naming\
    \ these objects\nand automatic service composition. An example of this is A framework\
    \ for IoT objects based on IoT-IMS\nplatform where the naming and management of\
    \ objects are done intelligently [30]. An intelligent\nIoT-based project called\
    \ IoT.est is an effort to support the exchange of information among distributed\n\
    and different IoT nodes, by the use of semantic technologies. IoT service is created\
    \ using a testbed,\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n5 of 24\nand several use cases\
    \ are used for validation purposes. IoT.est also not consider management and\n\
    scalability issues and only focus on the realization of IoT [31].\nTools which\
    \ are Platform-As-A-Service (PAAS), and it does not provide ease of use to new\
    \ users\nare also discussed in the literature. Some of the platforms discussed\
    \ by Vestergaard, L.S et al. [32] are\nDweet.IO [33], ThingWorx [34] and Particle.IO\
    \ [35]. Closed source is one of the disadvantages of such\nplatforms. Other well\
    \ known closed source IoT platforms are Google Cloud IoT [36] and AWS IoT\nplatform\
    \ [37]. To the best of our knowledge, the paradigm of these tools is either desktop-based\
    \ or\nweb-based. They say that if we can combine these paradigms and integrate\
    \ it into IoT applications,\nthen more ideal IoT applications can be developed.\
    \ We now present a summary of the well-known\narchitectures in Table 1. IoT platforms\

    \ discuss the proposed methodology of Task allocation for thermal comfort in\n\
    smart homes. The proposed methodology consists of several steps. Users use the\
    \ DIY application to\nadd the services they need. For instance, we add thermal\
    \ comfort service name and its requirements\nin detail as a case study for this\
    \ work. The description is analyzed by the IoT server through natural\nlanguage\
    \ processing libraries to split it into microservices. Microservices description\
    \ is analyzed by\nthe microservice analyzer component for generating input tasks.\
    \ Physical things are virtualized into\nvirtual objects through virtualization\
    \ mechanism provided by Virtual Device Manager(VDM), VO-Task\nMapping Manager\
    \ (TMM) mappes relevant tasks to relevant virtual objects. TMM loads tasks and\n\
    virtual objects to the mapping window and visualizes it through Graphical shapes.\
    \ User maps a task\non a virtual object based on the suggestions; A line is dropped\
    \ from tasks to virtual objects to establish\na connection. A mapping window generates\
    \ mapping pairs of tasks and virtual objects based on\nthese connections.\nSome\
    \ of these tasks and virtual objects pairs are more important than others and\
    \ should be\nexecuted ﬁrst than the others. The reordering of these pairs is done\
    \ by VO-Task Scheduling Manager\n(TSM). TSM has a scheduler component that receives\
    \ the mapping pairs from TMM and reorders the\nmapping pairs through scheduling\
    \ algorithms of the TSM. Task Allocation Manager( TAM) handles\nscheduling results\
    \ and allocate tasks into physical device based on the virtual object information\
    \ in\nthe scheduling results, i.e., id and URI of the virtual object, which virtualizes\
    \ a physical device. TAM\npasses the allocated time, device address and task message\
    \ to deployer, which ﬁnally deploys the task\non a physical device at the allocated\
    \ time. Figure 1 represents the proposed methodology.\nGood IoT architecture can\
    \ help develop a robust and scalable IoT solution. In this paper, we\npropose\
    \ a ﬁve-layered architecture for the design of IoT applications based on tasks\
    \ composition\nand virtual objects mechanisms. The proposed architecture is given\
    \ in Figure 2. Each Layer has its\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n6 of 24\nfunctionality;\
    \ the functional goal of all layers is to allocate tasks on virtual objects in\
    \ an IoT environment\nefﬁciently. Physical things Layer composed of physical devices,\
    \ these devices can be actuators and\nsensors. Examples of actuators can be categorized\
    \ to pneumatic actuators, hydraulic actuators, electric\nactuators, and thermal\

    \ System.\nThe Virtual Objects Layer represents the virtualization of physical\
    \ layer things; these physical\ndevices are virtualized into virtual objects.\
    \ VDM manages these virtual objects; virtual objects\nmanagement includes the\
    \ registration of physical devices to IoT server registry, Creation of virtual\n\
    for the physical device and connectivity of physical devices to virtual objects.\
    \ These virtual objects\nare visualized through sensors and actuators icons on\
    \ Google map. Each marker icon represents a\nvirtual object in the interactive\
    \ map environment; the marker is placed on the latitude and longitude\nof physical\
    \ device location on the building or other places where the device is physically\
    \ deployed.\nEach virtual object performs speciﬁc actions and having certain properties\
    \ representing attributes of\nthe physical device.\nThe Micros service layer is\
    \ responsible for analyzing the description of services and splitting\nthese services\
    \ into functional units based on the analysis results. A group of virtual objects\
    \ provides\nsome of these services and hence, this layer performs the role of\
    \ interconnection between Virtual\nobjects. The microservice composition manager(MSCM)\
    \ module is responsible for the management\nof this layer. MSCM is responsible\
    \ for providing the user interface for services composition, services\nanalysis,\
    \ and microservice generations. MSCM uses two approaches for Micro Services composition,\n\
    the ﬁrst approach compose microservices directly from its associated sensors and\

    \ layers, these tasks are utilized by process layers for further\noperation on\
    \ these tasks. The process layer is responsible for the visual environment where\
    \ tasks can\nbe mapped on virtual objects. Task Mapping is done manually through\
    \ a drag and drop approach.\nThese mapped task results are utilized by a process\
    \ created for task scheduling. The scheduling process\nconsiders task attributes\
    \ and scheduling algorithms to generate scheduling results. A process is created\n\
    for task allocation, which handles scheduling results and allocates tasks to the\
    \ physical device in the\navailable time slot; ﬁnally, tasks are deployed on the\
    \ physical devices.\n4. Design\nIn this section, we discuss the design of the\
    \ proposed system developed on the Task Composition\nArchitecture based on Virtual\
    \ Objects in IoT Environment. We discuss the processes of the platform\non top\
    \ of which thermal comfort mechanism is implemented. The ﬁrst process is the analysis\
    \ of\nthermal comfort servic to generate tasks. Task Generation Manager (TGM)\
    \ component of the system is\nresponsible for the initialization of TGM components\
    \ for Services analysis to generate tasks, the design\nof task generation from\
    \ microservices is given in Figure 3. Natural Language Processing techniques,\n\
    i.e., tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, are used to generate tasks from\
    \ the description of the\nmicroservices.The Part of Speech (POS) tagging technique\
    \ is used to detect the verb, which helps in\ndeciding the type of the task. Once\
    \ tasks are produced from the microservice description, the Task\nmanager is also\
    \ responsible for the interface for displaying the generated tasks proﬁle on the\
    \ form and\nﬁlling out the form’s visual components.\nTask Manager’s other responsibility\
    \ is extracting the conﬁguration proﬁle from both the\ninformation generated autonomously\
    \ through NLP algorithms and from the form information ﬁlled by\nthe user. The\
    \ parsed proﬁle is converted to task data and stored in the task repository. The\
    \ generated\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n8 of 24\ntask data is passed to TMM,\

    \ the virtualization of physical resources.\nVDM is the main module\nresponsible\
    \ for it to form virtual objects (VO). The virtualization process is also visualized\
    \ through\nvisual components by this module. VDM responsibilities include analyzing\
    \ the supported protocols\non the devices, e.g., CoAP and metadata. VDM also analyzes\
    \ supported methods and platforms that\nprovide the interface for adding, deletion\
    \ and updating of the virtual objects. The virtual object is a\nsimulation of\
    \ the physical device at the virtual IoT smart space. These virtual objects contains\
    \ all the\nattributes of the physical device with some extra attributes particular\
    \ for the virtual IoT environment.\nThese virtual objects also simulate the behaviour\
    \ of the physical device. Figure 4 represents the design\nof the Device virtualization\
    \ mechanism.\nThe third process is the association of tasks with virtual objects\
    \ called task mapping in recent\nstudies [8]. Task Mapping Manager(TMM) is the\
    \ design component responsible for the mapping\nmechanism. Task Mapping Conﬁguration\
    \ Flow is shown in the Figure 5. TMM initializes the graphical\nuser interface\
    \ and libraries needed for the mapping mechanism. The mapping mechanism is drag\n\
    and drop achieved through mapping libraries. TMM is connected to both task and\
    \ virtual objects\nrepository. TMM fetches all virtual objects, tasks, and stores\
    \ it in lists in the main memory. Task and\nvirtual object proﬁles are extracted\
    \ and fed into the mapper submodule of TMM. The user uses a drag\nand drop approach\
    \ to select a task and map it on the relevant virtual object by dropping a line\
    \ from\nthe task to a virtual object. TMM visualize the connection between tasks\
    \ and virtual objects using a\ngraphical line from task to a virtual object. TMM\
    \ saves the connections between virtual objects and\ntasks to a database repository.\n\

    \ Manager is\nresponsible for scheduling the Mapping Results on the physical devices.\
    \ The Scheduling Manager\nmanages the whole ﬂow of the information in the scheduling\
    \ window. Scheduling Manager is\nconnected to Task Mapping Repository, Virtual\
    \ Object Repository, and Task Repository.\nScheduling Manager ﬁrst initializes\
    \ the Scheduling window graphical user interface.\nTask mapping results are then\
    \ fetched from task Mapping repository. Task mapping results contain the\nID of\
    \ a task, and a virtual object, based on these ID’s tasks and virtual objects\
    \ are fetched from their\nrepositories. The design of the scheduling conﬁguration\
    \ is given in Figure 6. Once tasks and virtual\nobjects are loaded next step is\
    \ the ordering of the tasks, the primary purpose of task scheduling is a\nreordering\
    \ of tasks for task allocation in IoT application.\nScheduler module fetches virtual\
    \ object information and task proﬁle and creates a scheduling\nprocess using the\
    \ scheduling algorithm. The scheduling process outputs the scheduling order, which\
    \ is\nreordering of the mapping pairs. Scheduling Manager saves these results\
    \ into the scheduling repository\nin the pairs format task id, virtual object\

    5. Implementation and Results\nIn this research, we developed two DIY based applications\
    \ on the proposed architecture. One\napplication is desktop-based developed in\
    \ .NET technology; the other is web-based developed in\npython. Each of the application\
    \ projects has two main components, one is the IoT server and the\nother the DIY\
    \ toolbox, Table 2 explains the IoT server technology stack, whereas Table 3 explains\
    \ the\ntechnology stack of the DIY toolbox. The IoT server is installed on Raspberry\
    \ PI, all physical resources,\ni.e., sensors and actuators, are connected with\
    \ the IoT server. Arduino is used for the support of\nsensors, i.e., MQ-2 sensor.\
    \ A registry is maintained of the devices with its current status, the status\
    \ of\nthe device can be connected, disconnected, available or busy. The implementation\
    \ at the server side is\ndone through the Python programming language.\nSustainability\

    \ to the developers because it is a Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm.\nFor\
    \ the experimental purpose of this study, different physical resources such as\
    \ actuators and sensors\nare used. Examples of actuators used are LEDs and fans,\
    \ whereas among the sensors used are a hybrid\nsensor called BME 280, at which\
    \ three sensors are embedded, i.e., temperature, pressure, and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ Other sensors used as physical resources are particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)\
    \ and Gas\nsensor Co2.\nFlask server-side application is responsible for the registration\
    \ of these physical resources. This\nserver-side application identiﬁes each physical\
    \ resource by a unique identiﬁer called URI for every\nresource. To request these\
    \ remote resources applications such as our DIY toolbox is accessed through\n\
    these URI by sending an HTTP request to the IoT server, the server give an HTTP\
    \ response containing\nJSON object which is then parsed by the DIY Toolbox.\n\

    \ users where they can virtualize\nthe physical resources connected to their IT\
    \ smart space. Based on the services needed by the users,\ntasks are composed\
    \ through DIY application and ﬂask server. These tasks are mapped to virtual\n\
    objects based on the mapping mechanism explained in the design section. The DIY\
    \ toolbox allocates\ntasks on physical resources based on task scheduling results.\
    \ The DIY toolbox provides all these\nfunctionalities through simple dragging\
    \ and dropping approach. In the future, we will focus on\ndeveloping intelligence\
    \ to the toolbox for making the IntelliSense and suggestions to users more\nefﬁciently.\
    \ For the ease of the user, we will use natural language processing algorithms\
    \ such as the one\nused by the Alexa application.\nFigure 7 represents the structure\
    \ of the DIY applications developed for the evaluation of the\narchitecture client\
    \ application in C Sharp which executes over the common language runtime, and\
    \ the\nweb-based DIY application runs on python. The IoT server has handlers for\
    \ HTTP requests from the\nDIY toolbox and provides an HTTP response containing\
    \ JSON objects to the toolbox. The IoT server\nprovides VDM component of the toolbox\
    \ requests for virtualization of a physical device and devices\ninformation. The\
    \ response for virtualization requests contains device metadata and other attributes\
    \ of\na physical device. Requests containing the analysis of services of the IoT\
    \ environment are handled by\nthe service conﬁguration manager(SCM) a module developed\
    \ in python at the IoT server. The requests\nare parsed by the request parser\
    \ and responses are generated by the response manger.\nSustainability 2019, 11,\

    \ for thermal comfort monitoring is analyzed and microservices are\ngenerated.\
    \ IoT resources are available to the users through IoT services. The user adds\
    \ services\nthrough the DIY application; Microservices are generated autonomously\
    \ from services description.\nNatural Language Processing POS technique is used\
    \ to identify conjunction in the description of the\nservice and the Bigram model\
    \ is used for Semantic Analysis. Python’s NLTK library is used for the\ntokenization\
    \ and POS tagging. For the Bigram model python, ngram library is used. Figure\
    \ 8 represent\nthe implementation results of services and microservices. Section\
    \ (a) of Figure 8 visualize the services\ncomposed manually by the user through\
    \ the DIY application Interface. Section (b) of Figure 8 shows\nthe microservices\
    \ results generated based on the description of the service through Natural Language\n\
    Processing techniques.\nEach service and microservices having a context menu which\
    \ can be open by right-clicking\non the service or microservice. The context menu\
    \ contains a command for creating new services.\nDelete command can be used to\
    \ delete a service or microservice, and View command can be used to\ndisplay a\
    \ property window where description and various attributes of services and microservices\
    \ are\nvisualized through graphical user interface. A service named ‘Monitoring\
    \ Thermal comfort’ are used\nto generate two microservices, namely, Monitoring\
    \ Thermal comfort results and analysis of Thermal\ncomfort conditions. For better\
    \ visualization, if the microservice title is long, a short title is generated\n\
    by abbreviating the verb tokens.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n13 of 24\n(a)\
    \ Services\n(b) Micro Services\nFigure 8. Service and Micro Services Generation.\n\
    Once microservices are generated, they are analyzed to generate tasks. Task generation\
    \ from\nmicroservices is visualized in the Figure 9.\nThe ﬁgure shows task suggestions\
    \ based on the\nmicroservices description analysis by the DIY Application. Users\
    \ can either ignore the task suggestions\nby clicking the cancel command button\
    \ or utilizing the suggestion by pressing the Add Task command\nbutton. The task\
    \ information is then used by the Task Manager module to ﬁll the window form for\n\
    adding a task proﬁle. The user ﬁlls the rest of the information or modiﬁes the\
    \ task title, and then\nsaves the task by clicking the add command button. If\
    \ the user wants to cancel the task proﬁle adding\noperation, the user has to\
    \ click the close command button.\nFigure 9. Task Generation from Services.\n\
    The task proﬁle is then added to the local database table developed in MySQL in\
    \ our case, but any\ndatabase server can be used. The task proﬁle is ﬁnally added\
    \ to the cloud-based MySQL database. Each\ntask is fed to the Task Mapping Manager\
    \ which is responsible for visualization in the mapping window.\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5849\n14 of 24\nEach task is having a context menu, from which various\
    \ operations on the task can be performed.\nTasks can be added, deleted and previewed\
    \ in the graphical user interface of the DIY Application.\nThe next process is\
    \ device virtualization. As already discussed in the design section, VDM is the\n\
    main module responsible for the whole virtualization process of physical things\
    \ into Virtual objects.\nThe device virtualization process is also visualized\
    \ through an interactive map environment based\non the GMAP.NET library. A Virtual\
    \ object is represented through a map marker using a visual icon\nof the physical\
    \ thing. For example, Figure 10a represents the Interactive map with three physical\n\
    things virtualized. Two temperature sensors are visualized through a temperature\
    \ icon image. LED\nActuator is visualized through Red LED icon image. Each virtual\
    \ object is having an options window\nfrom where properties of the virtual object\
    \ can be previewed. Figure 10b is showing the options\nmenu which contains commands\
    \ button for opening windows of task mapping, task scheduling, task\nallocation,\
    \ and Task deployment. Each of these windows contains mapping, scheduling, allocation,\n\
    and deployment modules.\nPhysical things which are registered and currently connected\
    \ to IoT server are visualized on the\nmap at a location based on latitude and\
    \ longitude address of the physical device. The virtual objects\nconﬁguration\
    \ is stored in the form of JSON docs temporarily which is then stored to MySQL\
    \ database\nat a local server and ﬁnally synced to the cloud-based MySQL database.\n\
    (a) Map with Virtual objects\n(b) Virtual objects option Menu\nFigure 10. Device\
    \ Virtualization and Visualization on Map.\nAfter the virtualization of physical\
    \ things and Task generation, the next step is the mapping\nmechanism. The Mapping\
    \ mechanism from the implementation perspective is presented in Figure 11.\nThe\
    \ virtualization module extracts all the available virtual objects from the virtual\
    \ objects repository\nand feeds the virtual objects to the mapping module. The\
    \ task manager extracts the candidate tasks\nfrom the task repository and feeds\
    \ them to the mapping module. In the ﬁgure, Virtual objects are\nvisualized at\
    \ the left side of the mapping window as rounded cornered rectangles, whereas\
    \ tasks are\nvisualized at the right side of the mapping window as circle shapes.\
    \ A window interface utilizing\nMind Fusion diagramming library enables the user\
    \ to do a simple drag and drop operation of mapping.\nA line is dragged from the\
    \ task and dropped at the virtual object establishing a connection between\nthe\
    \ virtual object and task. Once the connection is made, the Generated Mapping\
    \ results are saved\ninto it the mapping repository. Mapping repository is a relational\
    \ table of MySQL database at the local\nserver and cloud MySQL. One mapping connection\
    \ is stored as one record of the mapping repository\ntable at the MySQL database.\
    \ The mapper repository stores the id of participating tasks and the id of\nvirtual\
    \ objects and the mapping time as a single row. In the ﬁgure ‘Mapped Task’ relational\
    \ table is the\nrepository where the results of the mapped tasks are stored.\n\

    \ Task mapping from Implementation Perspective.\nAfter task mapping, the next\
    \ step is task scheduling. As discussed earlier, mapping results are\npairs of\
    \ tasks and virtual objects, i.e., { task id, vo id, mapped time }. In the context\
    \ of this research\nstudy, Task scheduling is referred to the ordering of these\
    \ mapping pairs to minimize the network\nlatency. So Task scheduling changes the\
    \ order of mapping pairs such that more important tasks are\nallocated on the\
    \ devices ﬁrst, the importance of tasks is calculated from various task attributes\
    \ through\nscheduling algorithms. We used the concept of traditional scheduling\
    \ algorithms for the ordering of\nthe tasks. The scheduling window is embedded\
    \ with these algorithms and user select algorithms for\nthe ordering of tasks.\
    \ The ordered tasks are visualized through table and grant chart. Table 4 lists\
    \ task\nattributes considered by the scheduler for reordering the tasks.\nTable\

    \ Task\nscheduling algorithms are used to produce optimal task orders based on\
    \ the attributes of mapped tasks.\nAlgorithms we considered for scheduling are\
    \ First Come, First served (FCFS), Shortest Task Execution\nFirst (STEF), Shortest\
    \ Task deadline Time (STDT), highest Priority Task First(HPTF) and priority-based\n\
    round-robin. The scheduling manager is responsible for fetching the task and virtual\
    \ object proﬁles.\nIt also fetches mapping results of these tasks from the mapping\
    \ module. The interface provided by\nscheduling manger is used to choose an algorithm\
    \ and preview the scheduling results on the table\nand grant chart. Scheduling\
    \ algorithms consider an attribute or group of attributes mentioned in\nTable\
    \ 3. For example, FCFS considers only the arrival attribute, whereas STDT considers\
    \ the deadline\nattribute only. Human inspection on the scheduling results is\
    \ currently necessary. In the future, we are\nconsidering an autonomous intelligent\
    \ approach for task scheduling. Task scheduling manager saves\nthe generated results\
    \ into local and cloud-based MySQL repository. The scheduling results are stored\n\
    in the scheduling repository, which is fed into the task allocation manager for\
    \ allocation of the tasks on\nphysical devices.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n\

    \ based on the scheduling pairs.\nThe physical device is accessed through the\
    \ URI attribute of the virtual object. As discussed earlier,\nthe Raspberry PI\
    \ based IoT server keeps track of all the devices by maintaining the registry\
    \ of the\nconnected devices. URI contains a device model and encoded Message,\
    \ e.g., getTemp. This Message is\nparsed and decoded by the IoT server to allocate\
    \ the task on the physical device. Figure 13 shows the\nimplementation of the\

    \ to Tasks Allocation\nIn this section, a brief overview of maintaining Thermal\
    \ Comfort in IoT smart space is presented\nwhich summarized the use of the platform\
    \ and the accomplishment of service goal. The IoT smart\nspace in this case study\
    \ is the Mobile Computing lab, at Jeju National University. The example case\n\
    study has been illustrated in the light of the proposed architecture, signifying\
    \ the strengths of the\nproposed architecture. Table 5 describes the case study\
    \ at service, microservice and task levels. Service\n1 in the case study for the\
    \ Thermal Comfort detection and Notiﬁcation. This service is analyzed from\nits\
    \ description to split the service into functional units called microservices.\n\
    For Example, there are two microservices with Id’s 1.1 and 1.2 belonging to Service\
    \ ID 1. There\nare six tasks in Microservice with Id 1.1 and 2 tasks in Microservice\
    \ with Id 1.2. For this case study,\nRaspberry PI is used as an IoT server and\
    \ a PC server for Data Staging between sensors and Cloud\nSQL based MySQL. Sensors\
    \ such as MQ-2 Gas is connected to Arduino ESP 8266 board because\nthese sensors\
    \ belong to analog sensors family and connecting to Raspberry PI would require\
    \ another\nhardware such as digital to analog which will add a further overhead\
    \ and cost on the overall system.\nThe resources we use are shown in the experimental\
    \ setup shown in Figure 14. From the Experimental\nsetup, it can be understood\
    \ that The PC Server is responsible for accumulating all the data from Http\n\
    client and IoT servers. All sensors are either connected to the Http client or\
    \ the IoT server installed\non Raspberry PI. The PC server syncs the data with\
    \ Cloud SQL for MySQL and deploys tasks on the\nphysical devices either through\
    \ the HTTP client or through the IoT server.\nNOVA Dust Sensor SDS011\n(PM 2.5,PM\

    \ analysis of the proposed architecture. The performance\nof the proposed architecture\
    \ is evaluated using a round-trip time (RTT), Response Time, Latency and\nTask\
    \ Dropping rate metrics. The RTT in our scenarios is the total time the system\
    \ takes from task\ngeneration till task execution and physical device response\
    \ back to the DIY application. The DIY\napplication developed based on the proposed\
    \ architecture maintain logs for each task from its\ngeneration until its execution.\
    \ A log contains information such as task id, target device, deployment\nstatus\
    \ and execution time. For Performance analysis, we calculated the RTT metric by\
    \ deploying tasks\nmentioned in Table 5 via the toolbox.\nDeployment is made based\
    \ on different task parameters, i.e., execution time, period, arrival time\nand\
    \ priority. We deployed these twelve tasks eight times and recorded the total\
    \ times each task took\nfrom task generation to task execution and response back\
    \ to the application. From 8 observations of\neach task, we then calculated min,\
    \ max and Average RTT, which is shown in Figure 15. The RTT is\nmeasured in milliseconds,\
    \ results show that the minimum RTT is 5 ms in the case of the event-driven\n\
    tasks, for example, task ‘Notify Via Alarm’ and task ‘Notify Via LED’. The maximum\
    \ RTT is observed\nfor a task is 92 ms which is also minimum and bearable delay\
    \ for the execution of task which needs\ninput data from other tasks for its complete\
    \ execution.\nThe average RTT for all the tasks executed is 27.75 ms which shows\
    \ that architecture strength for\nimplementing the architecture in real-time scenarios\
    \ such as ﬁre safety and road safety. We consider the\nRTT of Tasks load is the\
    \ second performance analysis metric. For the RTT of Task load, we simulated\n\
    60 tasks in the Apache JMeter load testing tool and analyzed the performance irrespective\
    \ of the load,\nRTT of the simulation results are in the order of a few seconds.\
    \ Figure 16 illustrates the simulation\nanalysis visually through the Line chart.\
    \ Various tasks load from 4 tasks to 60 tasks were taken for\nthe load testing\
    \ of the DIY Toolbox. RTT of tasks is directly proportional to the number of tasks,\
    \ i.e.,\nincreasing the number of task loads will increase the RTT, but the average\
    \ RTT increase is negligible.\nFor instance, for 30 tasks, the minimum RTT observed\
    \ is 22 ms, the maximum RTT for 30 tasks observed\nis 29 ms, and the average time\
    \ for 30 tasks is 24.909 ms. A case study of thermal comfort can be utilized\n\
    in 12 tasks. The architecture can be utilized for more complex case studies in\
    \ the IoT environment.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n19 of 24\nFigure 15. Round\
    \ Trip Time based Performance Analysis of the proposed Architecture.\nFigure 16.\
    \ Round Trip Time Analysis for different Task load.\nThe third metric on which\
    \ we evaluate the proposed architecture is the response time over time.\nFigure\
    \ 17 shows the response time over time analysis of both periodic sensing tasks\
    \ and event driven\ntasks.The response time is calculated in Milliseconds for\
    \ both periodic sensing tasks and event-driven\ntasks. The maximum and minimum\
    \ response time for a periodic sensing task is 28.6 ms and 15 ms.\nCompare to\
    \ periodic sensing tasks maximum and minimum response time for event-driven tasks\
    \ are\n18.8 ms and 5 ms. As discussed in earlier sections that the sensing tasks\
    \ sense ambient scenarios and\nbased on contextual data generated, irregular patterns\
    \ are predicted. Based on these prediction control\ntasks are activated, which\
    \ can be executed with a variety of actuators. Having said that, the control\n\
    tasks, which are event-driven tasks, are of the highest possible priority. The\
    \ experiments carried out in\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n20 of 24\nthis section\
    \ afﬁrms that the proposed architecture always give more priority to event-driven\
    \ tasks, and\nthis can be witnessed by the lower response time in comparison with\
    \ sensing tasks.\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n48:37.0\n48:38.0\n\

    \ Response Time over Time.\nThe fourth metric we consider for the performance\
    \ evaluation is the stability of the architecture in\npeak load time. Task dropping\
    \ rate quantitatively accounts for the stability of the system. The lesser\nnumber\
    \ of tasks dropped in peak load time; the more stable will be the system. For\
    \ this, we carried\nout the task dropping analysis of the proposed architecture.\
    \ Figure 18 shows that as the number of\ninput tasks increases, task dropping\
    \ increases. The minimum task dropping rate is 0 for 26 tasks, and\nmaximum task\
    \ dropping rate is 14 for 600 tasks. It is evident from the rate of increase,\
    \ although the\nnumber of tasks increases but the rate of the dropping is very\
    \ steady. Even for 600 tasks, only 27 tasks\nare dropped, which in other words\
    \ implies that the performance of the system is 97.7%.\nFigure 18. Task Dropping\
    \ Rate.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n21 of 24\nFinally, we consider the latency\
    \ of tasks deployment; for this purpose, we simulated various sets\nof virtual\
    \ users in Locust, an open-source load testing tool, for cross-domain requests\
    \ from our Toolkit.\nFigure 19 shows the latency of tasks deployment in the simulated\
    \ environment. During testing, we\nprovided three sets of virtual users, 50 users,\
    \ 300 users and 1000 users. Minimum latency for 50, 300\nand 1000 users are 49\
    \ ms,71 ms, and 97 ms, respectively. Maximum latency of 50, 300 and 100 users\
    \ are\n358 ms, 455 ms and 830 ms, respectively. Finally, the average for 50, 300\
    \ and 1000 users are 238 ms,\n327 ms and 432 ms.\n50 Users, 238\n300 Users, 327\n\

    \ knowledge, Task Composition Architecture based on Virtual Objects\nin IoT Environment\
    \ is the ﬁrst-ever attempt towards task allocations in the IoT environment using\
    \ a\nDIY approach. There are only a few user interfaces for IoT integration platforms\
    \ such as Node-RED,\nAWS IoT, NoFlo, ioBroker, CoAP prototype-based DIY interface\
    \ for service customization of Remote\nIoT devices. These user interfaces are\
    \ the only integration platform for the internet of things and\ndo not provide\
    \ any task level management. First and foremost, The DIY toolkit developed on\
    \ the\nproposed architecture is a complete solution addressing various aspects\
    \ of task allocation in the IoT\nenvironment. These aspects include device virtualization,\
    \ microservices generation from services, task\ngeneration from microservices,\
    \ task mapping to virtual objects, task scheduling and task allocation\nand deployment\
    \ on the physical device. Table 6 provides a comparison of the proposed toolkit\
    \ and the\nrelated IoT integration platforms.\nFor the comparative analysis, we\
    \ consider various parameters including, open-source, DIY\nsupport, Remote Access,\
    \ Conﬁguration repository, ofﬂine access, cloud support, application type,\ngeneric\
    \ entity support, and task level management. One of the goodness of the proposed\
    \ architecture\nis the loosely coupled nature of the modules, making it very easy\
    \ to maintain. The architecture is\nwell-suited for IoT applications that involve\
    \ multi-devices and multi-tasks. The proposed architecture\nis ﬂexible, which\
    \ means that different algorithms for mapping, scheduling and allocation could\
    \ be\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n22 of 24\nintroduced without a major revamp\
    \ to the architecture. The freedom from hardware dependence,\ntask-level management\
    \ and DIY nature of the integration platform for the internet of things makes\
    \ our\nsolution a signiﬁcant, better and ideal solution towards the realization\
    \ of IoT network.\nTable 6. Comparative analysis of proposed Architecture with\

    \ towards the design and implementation of a task\ncomposition toolbox based on\
    \ virtual objects in the IoT environment. The proposed system allows\nthe user\
    \ to perform task allocation on both local and remote physical IoT devices. DIY\
    \ based toolbox\nis developed based on usability factors, the intuitive user interface\
    \ and zero coding approaches for\neffective task allocation and visualization\
    \ of all the modules processes make it a novel architecture. We\nhave made cloud\
    \ services available for data storage. The data from the local server is synced\
    \ and hence\nensures the data available to the user remotely. The DIY toolbox\
    \ also provides real-time visualization\nof the virtual objects and whole task\
    \ allocation process at remote IoT devices. In the future, we will add\nmachine\
    \ learning to automate task mapping to improve the capabilities of the composition\
    \ toolbox.\nTask scheduling can be improved by adding complex scheduling algorithms\
    \ for real-time scenarios,\nsuch as a Fair emergency ﬁrst. The proposed work can\
    \ also be improved by considering network\nlatencies and device paring for task\
    \ allocation autonomously. For the ease of the user, we will use\nnatural language\
    \ processing algorithms such as the one used by the Alexa application.\nAuthor\

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\

    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\
    \ and a high-level system architecture are presented in Section 5.\nDiscussion\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\

    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ such as WSN are potential candidates for integration with the\nIoT [107]. Essentially,\
    \ the low-power wireless communications contribute to improving\nboth IoT device\
    \ connections with the Internet and the overall efﬁciency of the IoT applica-\n\
    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    \ Analog-Digital-Converter;\nRF: Radio Frequency; Tx/Rx: Transmitter/Receiver).\n\
    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) continues
    to grow exponentially, in number of devices and the amount of data they generate.
    Processing this data requires an exponential increase in computing power. For
    example, aggregation can be done directly at the edge. However, aggregation is
    very limited; ideally we would like to do more general computations at the edge.
    In this paper we propose a framework for doing general-purpose edge computing
    directly on sensor networks themselves, without requiring external connections
    to gateways or cloud. This is challenging because sensor networks have unreliable
    communication, unreliable nodes, and limited (if any) computing power and storage.
    How can we implement production-quality components directly on these networks?
    We need to bridge the gap between the unreliable, limited infrastructure and the
    stringent requirements of the components. To solve this problem we present Achlys,
    an edge computing framework that provides reliable storage, computation, and communication
    capabilities directly on wireless networks of IoT sensor nodes. Using Achlys,
    the sensor network is able to configure and manage itself directly, without external
    connectivity. Achlys combines the Lasp key/value store and the Partisan communication
    library. Lasp provides efficient decentralized storage based on the properties
    of CRDTs (Conftict-Free Replicated Data Types). Partisan provides efficient connectivity
    and broadcast based on hybrid gossip. Both Lasp and Partisan are specifically
    designed to be extremely resilient. They are able to continue working despite
    high node churn, frequent network partitions, and unreliable communication. Our
    first implementation of Achlys is on a network of GRiSP embedded system boards.
    We choose GRiSP as our first implementation platform because it implements high-level
    functionality, namely Erlang, directly on the bare hardware and because it directly
    supports Pmod sensors and wireless connectivity. We give some first results on

    SECTION I. Introduction The edge computing paradigm has been widely accepted as
    an important concept for sustainability of future Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
    and Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) [1], [2]. It is well acknowledged by both
    enterprise and academia as a valid approach and is actively under research [3]–[5].
    Newer and more performant infrastructures are continuously elaborated both by
    CSPs and MNOs [6]. Concurrently, IoT devices are getting closer to being actually
    ubiquitous, i.e., closer to Mark Weiser''s idea of hundreds of wireless computing
    devices per person. This is already true in some scenarios, e.g., airplanes generate
    around 10 TB of data every 30 minutes. Such cases require very responsive and
    robust systems for sensor data processing, and could not rely on remote hosts
    for it, even if these are close to the edge. Since the Internet of Things is rapidly
    expanding and devices are becoming more powerful, IoT applications are putting
    severe strain on cloud providers. The edge computing paradigm is one way to solve
    this problem by distributing the workload in a more sustainable way across the
    whole network. With this paradigm, computational and storage resources move closer
    to the edge and IoT applications are able to preserve their QoS. Tasks that were
    previously done in the cloud are now be delegated to intermediates between datacenters
    and IoT edge networks. Existing designs are enabling this by bridging edge networks
    with intermediate gateways[7]. However, it is generally considered that the sensor
    and actuator networks themselves, such as traditional Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs), are too limited and unreliable to do their own management. Thus even in
    recent distributed sensor and IoT networks, a gateway node or a cloud connection
    is necessary, which adds a single point of failure and increases infrastructure
    complexity. If such a point is unable to provide its service, network management
    becomes impossible and sensor data cannot be retrieved anymore. And if gateways
    need to be permanently available, even short intervals of downtime can disrupt
    the entire system. A recent survey has portrayed the full landscape of emerging
    paradigms that strive towards the edge and fog principles[8]. It describes a few
    designs that share common goals with Achlys, such as mist computing and suggests
    that such architectures are a best fit for systems that require autonomous behavior,
    ability for distributed processing directly on IoT devices, little or no Internet
    connectivity and privacy preservation. A. The Achlys Framework This paper presents
    Achlys, a framework that directly addresses the problem of general-purpose edge
    computing. Achlys increases the resilience of sensor/actuator edge networks so
    that they are able to reliably execute application tasks directly on the edge
    nodes themselves. Achlys provides reliable decentralized communication, storage,
    and computation abilities, by leveraging CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data
    Types) and hybrid gossip algorithms. This lowers cost, reduces dependencies, and
    simplifies maintenance. Our system has no single point of failure. Achlys consists
    of three parts: GRiSP embedded system boards1, a Lasp CRDT-based key/value store,
    and the Partisan hybrid gossip-based communication component. Experimental releases
    and source code are available at ikopest.me, and can be deployed on GRiSP boards
    or run in an Erlang test shell. Achlys adds a task model to Lasp, which allows
    applications to be written by storing both their code and results directly inside
    Lasp. In this way, applications are as resilient as Lasp itself. The task model
    was first developed as part of a master''s thesis [9]. Application code is replicated
    automatically by Lasp on all nodes. From the developer''s viewpoint, Achlys applications
    are written in a similar way as applications written for transactional databases.
    The developer mindset is that the Lasp database always contains correct data.
    Application tasks can be executed at any time on any node by the task model. On
    every node, the task model periodically reads tasks from Lasp and executes them.
    An executing task reads data from Lasp, computes the updated data using node-specific
    sensor information, actuates node-specific actuators, and stores both the updated
    data and an updated task in Lasp. Because of the convergence properties of CRDTs,
    the same task can be executed more than once on different nodes without affecting
    correctness. This is a necessary condition for resilience, to keep running despite
    node failures and node turnover. We choose GRiSP because it directly implements
    Erlang on the bare hardware, which simplifies system development, and because
    it directly supports Pmod sensors and actuators and has built-in wireless connectivity.
    Computation and storage abilities of GRiSP are limited, but adequate for many
    management tasks (in fact, with the current GRiSP infrastructure, our system is
    comparable to state-of-the-art laptops released just before the year 2000). Our
    current system is a prototype that is able to run applications on networks of
    GRiSP boards. With this system we are in the process of implementing and evaluating
    a proof-of-concept application of Achlys to precision agriculture, in collaboration
    with Gluk Advice BV, as part of the LightKone European H2020 research project.
    B. Motivating Example We motivate this work with an example related to the precision
    agriculture use case we are developing. We envision a scenario where a farmer
    has decided to equip his farms with a Subsurface Drip Irrigation system. Despite
    that it is one of the most efficient precision irrigation technologies, it remains
    difficult to have sufficiently precise information about moisture levels, so as
    to make optimal use of the very expensive irrigation infrastructure. Inadequate
    irrigation can be extremely detrimental for production levels, as well as water
    supplies. We propose a Self-Sufficient Precision Agriculture Management System
    for Irrigation in order to allow the farmer to efficiently irrigate his farms.
    In addition to productivity gains, we intend to offer a solution that is near
    zeroconfig, i.e., it is able to configure itself with no intervention needed by
    the farmer. Finally, we want to provide a system that manages itself and requires
    little to no maintenance. It is possible to connect to the system, but this is
    only used for setting policy and is not needed for day-to-day running. The system''s
    management mechanisms are autonomous, independent of any third-party providers.
    Currently, the farmer''s irrigation system distributes water across the entire
    zone that is equipped with tubes delivering water to plantations when the farmer
    activates a pump. Since moisture levels can vary significantly inside a single
    farm, uniform irrigation can be detrimental as some parts will not receive enough
    water while in other parts water is wasted and irrigation is above the optimal
    levels. Our system is made of a set of distributed edge nodes that sense moisture
    levels and actuate on activation or deactivation of underground irrigation tubes.
    The farm is divided into sectors whose moisture levels are measured by an edge
    node, and irrigation is adjusted accordingly. Our solution activates the main
    irrigation pump and valves when necessary, and controls the water flow such that
    once sufficient moisture is achieved, actuators shut down the water flow of that
    sector while irrigation continues in other sectors. Irrigation decisions are made
    by an online optimization algorithm that runs continuously on the edge nodes themselves.
    The system thus provides completely autonomous basic management, without the need
    for any kind of Internet connection or computer. The system continuously optimizes
    its operation to provide adequate irrigation with minimal cost, and reconfigures
    itself whenever it detects a change in configuration. It is possible to change
    the irrigation policy by connecting a PC node to the edge network. This way, we
    extend the basic autonomous system with additional features that allow the farmer
    to use cloud infrastructures such as storage or high computational power when
    it is desired. For example, the edge nodes could be asked to measure how much
    water their sector has consumed based on temperatures during that period, and
    compute some metrics locally that could be extracted from the edge cluster and
    stored in the cloud at the end of each month. Learning processes applied to that
    data could again allow farmers to adjust the system behavior with their computer
    to gain in efficiency. C. Common Challenges In contrast to core cloud datacenters,
    edge networks are composed of large numbers of heterogeneous devices. Due to the
    highly dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge network topologies, nodes can
    also be temporarily isolated from the network. For these reasons, implementing
    desirable features such as reliable computation and storage directly on edge IoT
    networks is particularly complex. Possible solutions are proposed by industry
    actors such as 5G operators and CSPs, and are generally based on Points of Presence
    (POPs) located near client nodes and available through gateways. In addition,
    edge applications must be implemented to manage the limited resources of IoT nodes.
    Therefore efficient deployments at the edge require an adequate load balancing
    mechanism that ensures that there is no overload on any node. An important goal
    of edge computing is to offload efficiently the core of the network. Since there
    are several intermediary entities between cloud datacenters and IoT devices such
    as servers or smaller datacenters, optimal offloading would be achieved if components
    of each layer are able to process some requests autonomously and only rely on
    higher level nodes when necessary. Therefore, edge nodes should also strive for
    maximum independence, and take advantage of computational and storage resources
    of IoT devices to complement the edge POP solutions. Moreover, if edge computing
    extends the traditional cloud computing paradigm only up to peripheral POPs, it
    makes IoT nodes highly dependent on connectivity and exposes single points of
    failure. We suggest that the edge paradigm can be implemented in a way that allows
    offloading of the core at any level in the global network, even in the most peripheral
    parts. If IoT devices are able to provide some basic functionality, then higher
    level devices can rely on them to reduce their own workload. And the edge paradigm
    could therefore maximize the global offloading since it would distribute the load
    over all the parts of the edge that are able to perform tasks such as computations
    or data storage in a reliable way accordingly to their hardware resources. However,
    despite being standardized to some extent[10], [11], a global production ready
    end-to-end solution has not yet been deployed at scales coming close to those
    of traditional cloud architectures. There are still many engineering and practical
    considerations that must be addressed. In this regard, the LightKone H2020 European
    Project aims at providing a novel approach for general purpose computations at
    the edge. LightKone directly addresses the added complexity due to heterogeneity
    of IoT devices, which makes a general purpose computation model at the edge very
    attractive. D. Structure of the Article The remainder of this article is structured
    as follows. Section II gives a brief overview of current edge computing state
    of the art and some key enabling technologies for Achlys. Section III gives a
    structural overview of Achlys followed by use case examples in Section IV. Finally,
    Section V gives conclusions about the current state and future evolution of Achlys.
    SECTION II. Contributions In this section, we briefly discuss the contribution
    of the Achlys application framework in relationship with the global edge computing
    paradigm. A. Fault Tolerance Ensuring fault tolerance is an essential part for
    generic edge computing[12]. In order to fit the vision of the LightKone project,
    Achlys strives to guarantee this property. This implies that Achlys must be able
    to continue functioning even in case of system failure. These failures can be,
    but are not limited to Network partition or intermittent communication: a node
    or a set of nodes that are isolated from the rest of the network must be able
    to run and to preserve interoperability with other nodes when the network is repaired.
    Hardware failure or offline operation: if a hardware component becomes dysfunctional
    or goes offline (to save power), it should be contained so that the application
    preserve a maximum amount of features. B. Task Model Achlys provides a general
    purpose task model solution using Erlang higher-order functions. Since Erlang
    functions are just values (i.e., constants), they can be copied over a network
    like any other constant. Using this ability, Achlys is able to provide programmers
    with an API that allows them to easily disseminate generic tasks in a cluster
    and be able to retrieve the results if desired. As handling heterogeneity is a
    highly complex task for smart services at the edge[13]–[15], the Achlys prototype
    can also use this ability to make the task model homogeneous, despite heterogeneity
    of the infrastructure. This is compatible with a larger vision of future Internet,
    in which physical components will be virtualized[16]–[18] C. Data Consistency
    at the Edge Conflict resolution is one of the central problems of distributed
    and decentralized applications, and is the subject of extensive research[19]–[22].
    For example, when multiple actors modify the same data entity across a network
    partition, what should be done when the partition is repaired? CRDTs (Conflict-Free
    Replicated Data Types) provide a solution to this problem. They are mathematically
    designed to provide consistent replication with very weak synchronization between
    replicas: only eventual replica-to-replica communication is needed. The Lasp library
    uses a wide range of CRDT types for its data storage. To the developer, Lasp looks
    like a replicated distributed key/value store that runs directly on the IoT network.
    Section III-C gives more information on Lasp and CRDTs. SECTION III. Overview
    of the System Design We now present a more detailed description of the Achlys
    system, an Erlang2 implementation of a framework that combines the power of δ
    -CRDTs[22] in the Lasp store[23], [24], the Partisan communication component[25],
    and the GRiSP Runtime software. It provides application developers a way to build
    resilient distributed edge IoT applications. We leverage hybrid gossiping and
    the use of CRDTs in order to propose a platform that is able to provide reliable
    services directly on edge nodes, which are able to function autonomously even
    when no gateway or Internet access is available. A. GRiSP Base The GRiSP base
    board is the embedded system used to deploy Achlys networks in the current experimental
    phase. Its main advantage over other hardware is that it has sufficient resources[26]
    to run relevant Erlang applications, that is3: Microcontroller: Atmel SAM V71,
    including: ARM Cortex M7 CPU clocked at 300MHz 64 MBytes of SDRAM A MicroSD socket
    802.11b/g/n wireless antenna SPI, GPIO, 1-Wire and UART interfaces B. GRiSP Figure
    1 depicts how the GRiSP architecture is designed. The RTEMS4 (RTOS-like set of
    libraries) component is embedded inside the Erlang VM and makes it truly run on
    bare metal. Achlys greatly benefits from this unique design since it allows a
    much more direct interaction with the GRiSP base hardware. The GRiSP board directly
    supports Digilent Pmod5 modules. The latter offer a very wide range of sensing
    and actuating features that can be accessed at application level in Erlang. It
    is not necessary to write drivers in C in order to add new hardware features to
    extend the range of functionalities. Fig. 1. The GRiSP software stack compared
    to traditional designs. The hardware layer for GRiSP refers to the GRiSP base
    board that is currently available. Reprinted from GRiSP presentation by Adam Lindberg.
    Show All C. Lasp Lasp is a key part of the Achlys framework for both storage and
    computation. It provides both replicated data and computation, and guarantees
    that values will eventually converge on all nodes[23], [24]. Since our GRiSP boards
    run Erlang directly on bare metal, Lasp is a suitable option for consistency as
    it runs directly in Erlang[24]. The Lasp port to GRiSP was initiated in a master''s
    thesis at UCL[9]. Lasp supports various CRDTs including sets, counters and registers,
    all of which do consistent conflict resolution. For instance, a GCounter is a
    counter type that can only be incremented, and when all the operations performed
    on individual nodes converge, the entire cluster will see the same value, i.e.,
    the sum of all increments of the counter across all nodes. This is a very simple
    example; more complex examples such as sets and dictionaries are also part of
    Lasp, which allow both adding and removing of elements with the same convergence
    property. Achlys is thus able to handle concurrent modifications and guarantee
    that all nodes are eventually consistent, just as on cloud storage services. This
    works even on nodes with limited resources and intermittent connectivity. The
    only effect of node failures and intermittent connectivity is to slow down the
    convergence. CRDTs in Lasp are implemented using additional metadata that allows
    each operation at each node to be taken into consideration. In fact, the Lasp
    library uses an efficient implementation of CRDTs called delta-based dissemination
    mode, which propagates only delta-mutators[27], [22], i.e., update operations,
    instead of the full state, to achieve consistency. This uses significantly less
    traffic between nodes than a naive implementation that propagates the full state.
    D. Partisan Partisan[25] is the communication component used by Lasp to disseminate
    information between nodes. It provides a highly resilient alternative communication
    layer used instead of the default distributed Erlang communication. This layer
    combines the HyParView[28] membership and Plumtree[29] broadcast algorithms, to
    ensure both connectivity and communication, even in extremely dynamic and unreliable
    environments. Both algorithms use the hybrid gossip approach. Hybrid gossip is
    a sweet spot that combines the efficiency of standard distributed algorithms (e.g.,
    spanning tree broadcast in Plumtree) with the resilience of gossip. For example,
    in the case of Plumtree, the gossip algorithm is used to repair the spanning tree.
    Partisan comes with a set of configurable peer service modules that are each suited
    for different types of networks. Since the HyParView manager ensures reliable
    communication in networks with high attrition rates such as edge clusters, it
    is used in our configuration by default. But it can easily be adjusted to match
    other types of topologies, and also enables hosts that can be members of multiple
    clusters to use the optimal peer service. This makes it suitable for clusters
    of IoT nodes that are able to communicate with each other despite unreliable networks,
    but also to be able to communicate with other cluster types such as star or mesh
    topologies where reliable communication does not require the same amount of effort.
    Partisan is therefore flexible as well as resilient, and we are still able to
    configure edge nodes to communicate with servers, reliable clients or gateways
    without overhead that would be generated using HyParView in stable networks. Fig.

    E. Example Achlys Network Figure 2 shows a conceptual overview of a WSN setup
    of Achlys nodes that highlights several elements: The bottom layer consists of
    functions tem p 1,2 (Δ,m),p(Δ,m) that represent input streams of data based on
    environment variables measured by the nodes, in this example temperatures and
    pressure. The physical topology reflects the real world configuration of the nodes
    where each edge implies that the two vertices are able to establish radio communication.
    The virtual overlay that we are able to build using Partisan. Achlys provides
    functions to clusterize GRiSP nodes through Partisan and therefore partitions
    such as shown by dotted blue lines are abstracted away by the eventual consistency
    and partition tolerance properties. Physically isolated parts of the network keep
    functioning, and seamlessly recover once the links are reestablished. F. Local
    Aggregation The vast majority of raw IoT sensor data is usually very short-lived
    inside systems and ultimately leads to unnecessary storage. Hence in Achlys we
    introduce configurable parameters for aggregation of sensor data. This way programmers
    can still benefit from distributed storage but also take advantage of local memory
    or MicroSD cards to aggregate raw measurements and propagate mean values. The
    network loads and global storage volume are thus decreased and overall scalability
    is improved. G. Generic Task Model Achlys provides developers the ability to embed
    Erlang higher-order functions through a simple API as shown in Table I. This allows
    building applications using replicated higherorder functions. Each node receives
    tasks and can locally decide based on load-balancing information and destination
    targeting information if it needs to execute it. We used this model to generate
    replicated meteorological sensor data aggregations via generic functions supplied
    with specific tasks. A live dashboard of the currently converged view of the data
    was built and run on a laptop connected to the GRiSP sensor network. As long as
    that web client host was able to reach any node in the network, it could output
    its live view of the distributed storage. SECTION IV. Additional Use Cases A.
    Live IoT Sensor Dashboard Since our framework is implemented in Erlang, it is
    also possible to integrate it in Elixir6 applications. Elixir is a programming
    language that is built on top of the Erlang runtime system and adds several very
    popular web development features. This makes it possible to implement a web server
    that runs only at the edge and that can interact with an entire Achlys cluster
    as soon as a single node is reachable. Our previous work has already allowed us
    to display a minimal version of this use case implementation in the context of
    the LightKone project. Figure 3 gives a screenshot of a live display of recorded
    magnetic field data recorded with Digilent Pmod_NAV modules attached to GRiSP
    boards in the cluster. Achlys allows the live monitoring to be accessed from any
    edge node and it is guaranteed that the distributed database will be consistent
    regardless of the physical location as long as there is eventually a connection.
    This use case is a good display of the modular designs that can be implemented
    with Achlys. We can run isolated applications on IoT networks, add or remove nodes,
    and easily implement other types of custom nodes that will automatically work
    the existing cluster. For live monitoring of environmental variables with IoT
    actuators, the self-configuring and autonomous execution can be a starting point,
    and users are free to perform predictive analysis and machine learning y bridging
    the cluster with the cloud computing services. Once the learning process yields
    a new set of rules, the users can propagate them to all the network nodes and
    it will become autonomous again. B. Internet of Battlefield Things The U.S. Army
    Research Laboratory has announced an entire new research program dedicated uniquely
    to IoT devices[30]. It is focused on deriving the new theoretical models and systems
    that will bring the key advantages in military conflicts of the following decades.
    The IoBT researchers display a very strong interest in some properties that are
    not considered in edge computing IoT architectures designed for commercial use.
    The authors describe the IoBT network as dynamic and ubiquitous with a high degree
    of pervasiveness, and self-awareness and self-configuration of networks are explicitly
    stated as requirements. Based on the described areas of interest in IoBT, we imagine
    the use case of Achlys nodes in forward deployments of ground infrantry squads.
    These deployments can lead groups to be isolated in remote areas where no means
    of communication with remote operators is possible. During nights, the surroundings
    must be constantly watched and soldiers need to spread across areas they are exposed
    to higher risks once alone. If soldiers were to be equipped with a set of Achlys
    nodes, they would be able to maintain their cluster membership even with all the
    crew members on the terrain, and since the sensors can immediately produce data
    that can indicate distress such as heat or trembling, the real-time threat analysis
    can be immediately be propagated to all the members in the area. In urban combat
    scenarios, this is particularly desirable as individuals are often in buildings
    or confined spaces where they cannot see each other while Achlys would be able
    to propagate alarms to all the reachable members. And during all missions Achlys
    nodes would record success metrics, environmental variables, and network topology
    changes that would be stored during entire operations, and once groups return
    to bases they all provide the data to nodes with high computing capacities that
    can make predictive analysis that would be used again in future deployments and
    could easily be passed between units if they are in communication range. We have
    observed that the key features of Achlys that provide reliable communication and
    storage correspond to numerous requirements of IoBT since they must remain operational
    regardless of their environment. Table I Generic task model API functions. Fig.

    SECTION V. Conclusion We introduce Achlys, a framework for general purpose edge
    computing that runs directly on sensor/actuator networks with unreliable nodes,
    intermittent communication, and limited computation and storage resources. Our
    current Achlys prototype is written in Erlang and runs on a wireless ad hoc network
    of GRiSP sensor/actuator boards. Achlys uses the Lasp and Partisan libraries to
    provide reliable storage, computation, and communication. Lasp is a distributed
    key/-value store based on CRDTs, which is used both for storage (with efficient
    δ -CRDTs) and as dynamic management tool to allow dissemination of general-purpose
    computing functions inside the network. Partisan is a communication component
    that provides highly resilient broadcast and connectivity for dynamic networks
    with intermittent connectivity, by using the Plumtree and HyParView hybrid gossip
    algorithms. Because it is written in Erlang, Achlys can also be used on any infrastructure
    based on the Erlang runtime. For example, it can be used on scalable web servers
    written in Elixir, because Elixir interoperates seamlessly with Erlang. Our experiments
    show encouraging results and validate the feasibility of our IoT edge computing
    model. This allows us to focus on improving efficiency and usability aspects of
    Achlys. In particular, further engineering work will be dedicated to minimize
    the resource usage of the framework and its dependencies. We intend to provide
    a framework that supports applications on embedded systems in actual deployments,
    and thus storage, computation and memory requirements of Achlys need to be carefully
    managed. Techniques for compact storage will be investigated such that we increase
    the amount of information that is passed through CRDTs while keeping the size
    identical. Furthermore, other optimizations in terms of networking and self-adaptation
    will be done in order to elaborate more intelligent clustering mechanisms. This
    will be reported in further work and measurements of efficiency and resilience
    with fine-grained adjustments of Partisan''s parameters will help us implement
    a context-aware networking behavior for Achlys, reducing unnecessary bandwidth
    usage and connections. Finally, in order to reduce application size, we will study
    if unused modules can be excluded from the releases deployed on the embedded systems,
    and if compression features that are available through Erlang compiler flags can
    preserve the features of Achlys while leaving more space for applications developed
    on top. While we will keep improving Achlys, it will also be used for proof-of-concept
    implementations of use case scenarios in edge computing, and in particular for
    precision agriculture. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is partially funded by the LightKone

    • Strategies of association between Edge, Fog, Cloud. • New architectural and

    or Smart Farming, is at the origin of the production of a huge amount of data
    that must be collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing
    this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted
    IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud,
    Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends
    used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research
    questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture
    4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures
    meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal
    development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization?
    (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained
    in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures
    with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput,
    Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the
    advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    the Internet of Things (IoT), also formerly named pervasive Internet, is present
    in all domains of our daily life and follows exponential growth. The number of
    connected devices is estimated at the horizon of 2022 at 42.5 billion and at the
    horizon of 2025 at 75.5 billion1. The global IP traffic is estimated to 333 ZB
    per month in 20222 with the need to store and treat this data (Carnevale et al.,
    2019). The European Commission has predicted that 18 billion of 29 billion connected
    devices will be related to the IoT in 2022 (Agency, 2020). Cisco in a white paper
    has announced that connected devices to the Internet will generate 850 ZB/year
    by 2021 (Cisco, 2018). It is difficult to precisely determine the number of connected
    devices on a world scale, but their number is about several billion. In addition,
    McKinsey Global Institute predicts a total economic impact of IoT and Edge Computing
    devices that will reach 11 trillion USD by 2025 (Manyika and Chui, 2015). In the
    sector of the agriculture, nearly 12 million agricultural sensors installed globally
    by 2023 with an increase of 20% annually, which is predicted by the Business Insider
    Intelligence Service (Meola, 2021). Moreover, the smart agriculture business was
    estimated at USD 13.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 22 billion
    by 2025 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.8% (Meola, 2021). Within
    the IoT era, the type of clients is becoming increasingly lightweight. IoT devices
    and the network environment is gradually changing from high-speed wired networks
    to unstable wireless communication. Meanwhile, users'' demand IoT applications
    is also shifting to real-time and context-aware service provisioning, making the
    focus moving progressively from the cloud to the edge (Ren et al., 2017). The
    cloud is located within the Internet and is geographically centralized, is constituted
    of a few resourceful server nodes, and is inserted in multi hops in terms of distance
    among the clients (Munir et al., 2017). Cloud Computing (CC) is a paradigm widely
    available that offers benefits like minimal management effort, convenience, rapid
    elasticity, pay per use, ubiquity (Ai et al., 2018), easy maintenance, centralized
    management, and high server utilization (Shi et al., 2016). Furthermore, resources
    centralization implies an increase of average network latency, heavy bandwidth
    utilization, and high processing delay. Indeed, the tremendous amount of data
    handled in a unique server point can create congestion in the cloud servers and
    backhaul links (El-Sayed et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the rapid parallel development
    of the pervasive intelligent device, ubiquitous network, growth in popularity
    of virtual and augmented reality, self-driving vehicles, UAVs, social networks,
    networks applications, and services are not without consequences. As a matter
    of fact, the network bandwidth and speed limit performance and effectiveness of
    cloud computing especially for real-time and mission-critical applications cannot
    be guaranteed. Moreover, cloud computing can be hardly adapted or applied to various
    types of technologies and applications scenarios (Zhou et al., 2017). To address
    these issues, various extensions of central cloud computing have been proposed
    by industrial and academics to move computing and storage at the edge of the network
    close to users. Fog computing uses network elements between the central cloud
    and the edge of network and absolute edge elements such as microcontrollers close
    to sensors to process and store data with a distributed manner close to nodes.
    Whereas, with the developments of mobile devices, some new paradigms close to
    mobiles users have been proposed. For example, cloudlets or micro data centers
    are geographically implanted and accessible by means of Wi-Fi protocols; but,
    this approach does not always guarantee enough network quality. Manufacturers
    of cellular network equipment have proposed the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm
    that associates fog servers with base stations to provide services to mobile devices.
    MEC associated with 5G allows to combine an ultra-low latency network with high
    available bandwidth, and processing resources accessible in the vicinity. The
    MEC original concept has been extended then to wireless networks and consequently
    renamed in “Multi-access Edge Computing” (Wang et al., 2020). Agriculture has
    previously undergone two waves of revolution. The first one was mechanization
    and the second was called the green revolution with genetic modifications (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). Since the late 1990s, the digital transformation of the
    agriculture in Agriculture 3.0 also called Precision Agriculture has begun with
    the integration of Geographical Information System (GIS), Global Positioning Systems
    (GPS), and the usage of sensors have invaded agriculture. They allowed the emergency
    of image processing, techniques using deep learning, and machine learning in the
    field of computer vision. This latter is implemented to discriminate weed, identify
    crops, detect diseases,…etc. The production of a large amount of data by agriculture
    3.0 has required the development of big data technologies to process them, reflecting
    important changes in various fields of research. Collected data must be recorded
    in a specific format in order to discover patterns, curate errors, eliminate duplicated
    or inconsistent data, or solve noise problems (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Smart
    Farming also called Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is a domain of IoT in
    full growth which bring innovative paths to improve the adaptability, the efficiency,
    and the resilience of the agriculture of production systems (Iaksch et al., 2021)
    boost competitiveness and profit (Triantafyllou et al., 2019), allocate resources
    reasonably, and avoid food waste (Zhai et al., 2020, Wolfert et al., 2017) thanks
    to the contribution of autonomous context awareness provided by sensors and the
    capability to execute autonomous or remote actions (Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart
    Farming displaces the strict application from the farm location to affect related
    fields such as decision making by farmers, biodiversity, supply chains management,
    food availability and quality, insurance, and research in environment and earth
    sciences,… Smart Farming is distinct from other domains of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) by the observation and action of biological objects (animals or plants).
    It differs from medical IoT by the fact that there are no issues related to privacy;
    but, the confidentiality of data is related to production processes. Like most
    areas of the IoT, Wireless Sensing and Actuating Network (WSAN) use Low-power
    and Lossy Network organized in hierarchical routing to collect data and actuate
    devices. Multi-path routing protocols can also be implemented to balance the data
    transfer load and conserve the energy of limited battery life, basic computational
    skills, unique communication identifier, and resources-constrained nodes. Due
    to the limited battery life, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to recharge
    or replace (Debauche et al., 2021). Moreover, energy-saving and ambient energy
    techniques must be applied to deal with the active and inactive operational time
    and schedule information transmission (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). To which objects
    can be added like connected agricultural vehicles, milking robots, Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) commonly known as drones, Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) also called
    robots, mobile devices such as tablets used to encode punctual observations (Debauche
    et al., 2021), and external sources such as public geo-services (Triantafyllou
    et al., 2019). The use of IoT in agriculture 4.0 ranges from family farming as
    for example in India on a very small scale with a few low-cost sensors and actuators
    to very large scales with thousands of expensive commercial sensors and many connected
    agricultural pieces of machineries as in the American mid-west. Smart Farming
    is characterized as aforementioned by a wide variety of objects that can produce
    the highly contrasted amounts of data from few bytes/s to Gb/s. In addition, the
    availability of network protocols in rural areas to transmit this data impact
    also the type of architecture to implement. Applications need treatments in real-time
    and/or at a different time. The ”real-time” requirements are also very variable
    depending on the use case. For instance, remote control of drones requires reaction
    times of at most a few milliseconds while the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRF) or
    Variable Spraying (VS) application aim to optimize nutrients and herbicides application
    respectively need reaction time in a range of few milliseconds to few seconds.
    The real-time processing for monitoring a herd of cattle is of the order of a
    few minutes to a few hours. The data retention time is very variable and is highly
    dependent on each use case. For example, UAVs produce tremendous quantities of
    images to transfer to the cloud in real-time where they must be quickly processed
    and stored. They can also be post-processed to extract additional data in batch
    processing. While UGVs images lose their value after processing and eventually
    actuating. However, if data is of a special, new or exceptional nature, it can
    be stored with a view, for example, to improving artificial intelligence algorithms.
    Other sensors transmit data only when anomalies are detected while others transmit
    at regular intervals a tiny amount of data. However, the adoption of Smart Farming
    is hampered by the lack of models to guide stakeholders on how to implement and
    to deploy dense and heterogeneous IoT-based monitoring systems and manage their
    interoperability (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Commercial sensors are very expensive
    making it impossible for small farms to implement them (Garcia et al., 2020).
    In addition, two trends are currently opposed. That coming from the manufacturers
    of agricultural machinery who have developed their ecosystems and who want to
    extend the services offered to farmers by attracting them into the captive ecosystems
    in which they are locked. Furthermore, another trend is the development of open
    ecosystems in which farmers can preserve the ownership of their data and keep
    control of the processing carried out on this data and of their use. On one hand,
    farmers are therefore faced with a dilemma where they are in any case forced to
    use agricultural equipment that collects their data against their will; on the
    other hand, they want to keep control of their data collected through IoT sensors.
    Currently, it is difficult to predict which of these two trends will take precedence
    over the other or whether one of the two will coexist (Wolfert et al., 2017).
    In this context, both private and public researchers can either use generic commercial
    platforms offered by cloud players on which they have limited possibilities of
    adaptation or develop their own architecture on the basis of commercial or free
    bricks, but with much greater possibilities of adaptation. In this case, the choice
    is also delicate, and a bad evaluation of the constraints can jeopardize the research
    project. Due to the recent advances in big data, we present a survey that provides
    an overview of the state of the art regarding Smart Farming. It aims at summarizing
    parameters that condition the choice of architecture to collect, process, and
    store agricultural data. Since there is a wide variety of use cases, it is important
    to make an informed choice when it comes to architecture. In this way, we address
    the current gap in the literature with a review of cloud architecture used in
    Agriculture 4.0 to collect, process, and store data to enlighten the reader about
    the possible choices and the new trends that emerge. The rest of this paper is
    structured as follows: The second section is composed of two parts. In the first
    part, we summarize related previous review in the domain and their contributions,
    in order to contextualize our contribution to the literature. In the second part,
    we identify architectures implemented in Agriculture 4.0 use cases. In the third
    section, we describe the methodology used to identify papers, the conceptual framework
    used to analyze the literature, and the criteria used to compare the selected
    architectures. In the fourth section, we present architectures used to collect,
    process, and store data. We describe successively the cloud-centric architectures,
    the extension of cloud paradigm, the distributed architecture. In the fifth section,
    new trends and futures directions are presented. In the sixth section, we discuss
    the future evolution of Agriculture 4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. Finally, the last
    section concludes this paper with recommendations and perspectives. 2. Related
    works We begin our review by identifying the previous review realized in the field
    of Internet of Things applied to Smart Agriculture to take stock of the state
    of art and highlighting aspects that have not been explored at the present time.
    In this section, we focus to achieve two objectives. The first aims to position
    our work in relation to the existing literature. The second aims to identify architectures
    commonly used in the case of applications in Agriculture 4.0. 2.1. Previous reviews
    Reviewed papers presented in Table 1 were selected in the timeframe from January
    2017 to July 2021. The major contribution of each paper was extracted and highlighted

    2021) In the following paragraphs, we will draw a panoramic summary of the existing
    reviews during the past four years (2017–2021). In 2017, Ray (Ray, 2017) reviewed
    throughout his paper IoT applications and the challenges that have been faced
    while IoT deployment to improve farming. Talavera. et al. (Talavera et al., 2017)
    reviewed agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) for monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Tzounis et
    al. conducted a survey of IoT technologies in agriculture and the challenges that
    farmers face going forward (Tzounis et al., 2017). Elijah et al. identified the
    most encountered challenges in the field of IoT applications in smart agriculture
    and presented common trends for innovative ideas (Elijah et al., 2018). In 2019,
    Ayaz et al. provided a state-of-art about IoT-based architectures applied in agriculture
    and identified present and future trends in the same field of study (Ayaz et al.,
    2019). Farooq et al. presented the ingredients of IoT-based smart farming with
    used technologies that apply the utilization of network architecture and protocols;
    in addition to that, they provided an overview of the regulations and policies
    of the use of IoT in farming regarding security and privacy. They concluded their
    study by summarizing the main challenges encountered in this discipline (Farooq
    et al., 2019). Feng et al. provided an overview of the wireless communication
    technologies in the precision agriculture domain. They benchmarked the prospection
    and challenges of existing technologies with the regular communication time used
    (Feng et al., 2019). Shafi et al. conducted a literature review about IoT-based
    automation of agriculture along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These authors
    presented a case study based upon two models: 1- a WSN to monitor real-time crop
    of health conditions, 2- system-base remote sensing imagery to classification
    between healthy and unhealthy yield (Shafi et al., 2019). In terms of agriculture
    protection, Shi et al. drew a panoramic review during the last decade to address
    the challenge and future works to further the research in the field of protected
    agriculture (Shi et al., 2019). Khanna et Kaur called into an evolutionary scenario
    to highlight the most significant impact of IoT in Precision Agriculture (PA).
    They evaluated the contribution of their predecessors and enhanced the challenges
    to open up a new direction of inspiration and innovation in IoT applied to PA
    (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). Ruan et al. reviewed literature works from 2009 to 2018
    to suggest new ideas for folks interested to conduct research in the field of
    agriculture IoT, infrastructures, data security, and data sharing (Ruan et al.,
    2019). In 2020, two studies have been carried out about 20 UAV applications that
    are devoted to either aerial crop monitoring processes or spraying tasks (Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al., 2020) and about the dilemmas that researchers must overcome while deploying
    IoT in the green agriculture domain (Ferrag et al., 2020). Villa-Henriksen et
    al. identified different challenges encountered during the implementation of IoT
    in various applications and proposed different solutions to address them (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Misra et al. discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in Smart
    Farming (Misra et al., 2020). In 2021, a recent study conducted by Friha et al.
    hypothesize the use, application, classification, and comparison of the most developed
    emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV), Wireless Technologies, open-source IoT platforms, Software Defined Networking
    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, cloud/fog computing,
    and middleware platforms (Friha et al., 2021). In the same year, Debauche et al.
    conducted a literature review to describe the main components of IoT and its applications
    in the field of Smart Farming (Debauche et al., 2021). 2.2. Platforms implemented
    in use cases We grouped applications into 4 categories: (1) Water Management in
    which we have aggregate all types of water use such as irrigation and watering
    animals. (2) Plant Disease and Pest groups all use cases in plant’s pathologies
    detection and treatment of plant pathologies (spraying of fungicides, pesticides,
    etc). (3) Crop Management brings together all the use cases relating to cropping
    operations: soil management (plowing, fertilizer application), sowing, weeding,
    and harvesting. (4) Livestock includes everything related to the breeding of farm
    animals (nutrition, behavior, diseases, treatments). Table 2 summarizes platform
    used to implement use cases in Smart Farming classified following our four categories.

    in Smart Irrigation in which they showed that data is stored in the database or
    in the cloud. On 151 reviewed papers, one uses Raspberry Pi, 18 databases, 53
    clouds, and 79 are self-developed or not mentioned (Garcia et al., 2020). Navarro
    et al. identified 21 Platforms used in 50 various use cases classified into 5
    categories: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, Computer Vision,
    and Other/Not Identified (Navarro et al., 2020). Jayaraman et al. present SmartFarmNet,
    an IoT platform offering effortless integration of sensors, supporting scalable
    data analytics, and proposing do-it-yourself tools to analyze and visualize data
    (Jayaraman et al., 2016). Codeluppi et al. describe LoRaFarM a general architecture
    modulated depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements (Codeluppi
    et al., 2020). The monitoring of crops particularly more sensitive to them as
    saffron is crucial. The DIAS Architecture (Triantafyllou et al., 2019) uses different
    ground and leaf sensors to monitor the real-time 24/24 h cultivation process of
    saffron. This data is transmitted by LoRaWAN with IPv6 protocol and MQTT-SN protocol
    to FIWARE’s context broker. The broker manages all networking devices by means
    of sixteen types of messages exchanged following publish-subscribe model. The
    FIWARE NGSI API of oversees the consumption, subscription, and processing of all
    the information collected and its publication. Afterward, the data is stored and
    analyzed with a random forest algorithm which allows extracting information about
    the crop growth and health. Vegetation indexes: Normalized Difference Index (NDI),
    Excess Greenness Index (ExG) are calculated with PiX4D3 image processing tools.
    Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is used to recognize weeds or discriminate
    species. Finally, collected data are categorized and evaluated accordingly with
    vegetation index values, moisture level, and plant developing state by means of
    the Apache Spark framework for the Big Data analysis and Waikato Environment (WEKA)
    a framework specialized in data mining to produce reports and predictions. Decision-making
    is a very important task in the farmers’ activities but with the amount of data
    always increasing, they encounter difficulties on one hand to make proper decision
    about agricultural management and on the other hand translate this data into practical
    knowledge (Zhai et al., 2020). On the other hand, there is a need for platforms
    of the Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) to assist farmers to make precise
    decisions evidence-based. For example, Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture
    combines IBM Watson with IoT and Cloud Computing to detect crop disease from UAV
    images. It is also possible to optimize time for crop operations to obtain a better
    price on trading market. The second example is Digital Farming System4 takes advantage
    of computer vision, cloud computing, and AI to propose a better timing for corp
    operations, notify when a crop is infected by any disease. Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System (SIDSS) is composed on one hand of a set of sensors and a weather
    station and on the other hand a DSS based on two machine learning algorithms.
    Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to deduct unnecessary variables and Adaptive
    Neuro -Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) used to minimize estimated errors under
    a target threshold (Navarro-Hellin et al., 2016). SIDSS generates planning of
    water amount and time for irrigation. Multi-robot sense-act system (Conesa-Munoz
    et al., 2016) is a planner of aerial and ground vehicles which assign tasks to
    the most appropriate work units. A Harmony Search Algorithm is used to optimize
    plans for UAVs while meta heuristic is running for ground vehicles. 2.3. Analysis
    of previous literature The analysis of existing reviews about smart farming shows
    that applications use whether open source or commercial cloud architecture whether
    developing specific architecture responding to their aims or do not describe their
    storage and processing system. The latter represents more than half of the papers
    and means that some of the processing architectures remain unknown because they
    have never been specifically described and studied. Moreover, the fact that further
    development is being made in architecture may be the fact that commercial platforms
    do not fully address the needs of Agriculture 4.0. This brings us to our research
    questions and their respective motivation: 1. Which storage and processing architectures
    are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address its particularities?
    Motivation: On one hand generic architectures dedicated or not to IoT are able
    to address a large number of use cases but not specifically the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 exist. On the other hand, researchers develop architectures to address specific
    issues or requirements of use cases. The selection of an adapted architecture
    is crucial for the correct implementation of identified use cases. 2. Can generic
    architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? Motivation:
    Agriculture 4.0 has specific requirements described in the introduction section
    which cannot all be addressed by a single classical generic architecture. A comparison
    between the pros and the cons of major generic architecture in the context of
    agriculture 4.0 is important to highlight the choice during the conceptualization
    step. 3. What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that allow the transition
    from research to industrialization? Motivation: The use of architectural solutions
    which can be for example free of fees during the research phase but needs a reimplementation
    caused by license limitations, the cost of the license in the use cases budget,
    etc. The use of products in closed or semi-closed ecosystems is a barrier to the
    research valuation. 4. What are the vertical valuation possibilities to move from
    algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or autonomous products? Motivation:
    The massive collection of data in the cloud allows to development of complex algorithms
    that need a large amount of computing resources to be elaborated. Afterward, they
    can be compressed, reduced, optimized in order to be deployed in embedded devices
    or divided and establish a collaboration between devices and computing resources
    such as cloud, fog, etc. In order to answer these questions, a review of the literature
    will make it possible to synthesize the different approaches currently used, to
    identify new trends and to consider new lines of research to be explored. 3. Methodology
    In order to address, our first and second research questions, we achieve a systematic
    review to identify generic architectures and combination of architectural elements
    used by researchers to implement concrete use cases. Moreover, we attempt also
    identify commercial products and existing services/ platforms used to implement
    projects in agriculture. 3.1. Systematic review methodology The research questions
    outlined at the end of the related work section has been addressed by combining
    keywords of the first group that refers to architectures (i.e. cloud architecture,
    distributed architecture, big data, Internet of Things, IoT) and of the second
    group contained keywords related to agriculture (i.e. agriculture, smart farming,
    food, agri-food, precision agriculture). Our methodology is based on 3 consecutive
    steps: literature identification, reading literature, and information extraction.
    During the first step, we have read and have collected individual papers based
    on the achieved of previous papers. We have reviewed and completed by a systematic
    survey of white literature (full articles and conference papers) from January
    2016 to December 2020. In addition, we targeted solely and exclusively papers
    written in English and focusing on architecture design have been considered. Our
    bibliographic review was limited to the last 5 years because the rapid development
    of IoT. The systematic review was retrieved from the following major bibliographic
    databases: Scopus (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Wiley Online Library,
    ACM Digital Library, and Springer. These bibliographic databases have been chosen
    widely covering relevant bibliography and relevant advanced bibliometric features
    especially number of citation and relevant literature suggestion. From these databases
    1058 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. After their screening 55 papers were
    classified relevant while remaining articles were considerate not relevant and
    therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. The high number of excluded
    papers is due to numerous papers describe i.e. conceptual or theoretic architectures
    which were never implemented, experimental architectures that have been the subject
    of a single article or that have never been proven by other research teams. We
    discard also papers that were not a directly related Big data and the agricultural
    sector. Table 3. Table 3. Keywords used for achieved the systematic review. Area

    (reports, blogs, magazines, and web-items) into our review using Web of Science
    and Google Scholar. Table 4. We discarded papers that were written in other languages
    than English, Master and doctoral dissertation, and duplicated articles gathered
    from Google Scholar. Afterward, we have selected literature that has carefully
    been read in detail to extract relevant information of research questions. The
    extracted information was analyzed and summarized in a conceptual framework illustrated
    in the Fig. 1. Table 4. Sources of collected literature. Data source URL IEEE

    Three ways of treatment of data are possible. The first process data in real-time
    (left branch identified by (1) on Fig. 1), this one is generally not stored except
    eventually particular or exceptional data in order to enrich the training database
    of artificial intelligence algorithms. This way of data treatment is used for
    example by robots that inspect a crop, discover a pest, and then eliminate it.
    After intervention the value data is near null. The second way is a mixed way
    in which data must be processed as quickly as possible. This one addresses use
    cases where latency required must be comprised between few milliseconds to few
    seconds with data, which conserves a value during a certain period of time. This
    latter justifies its storage according to the use case data management plan that
    predicts the time after which the data will be aggregated and then deleted. This
    way in identified by (2) on Fig. 1. It addresses use cases where all data must
    be processed and then stored for eventual post-processing for example to estimate
    trends of parameters such as the milk quality, volume of palatable species available
    in a pasture. The third way is stored data theirs native format without transformation
    (Identified by (3) on Fig. 1). This way is implemented on use cases that do not
    require real time processing or use cases where the amount data is so important,
    which makes treatment impossible. In this latter case, data are consumed by micro
    services that sample data to exact knowledge. This way is also employed for data
    which have a low value or lose their value so quickly that there is no point in
    transforming them for long-term storage. For instance, a UGV identifies and eliminates
    a pest. The image of the insect is no longer relevant after its elimination. 3.2.
    Architecture comparison criteria In order to compare selected architectures, we
    chose to select 8 criteria:(1) User Proximity expresses the necessity to be close
    to the user. This criterion is important for applications where privacy and response
    time to query are critical. Attribute a value of one * when privacy is not crucial;
    ** when the proximity with user is desirable but not crucial for the development
    of the use case; *** when the user proximity is the corner stone of the application.
    (2) Latency & Jitter criterion describes the importance for the architecture to
    have a minimal latency and jitter. This criterion is particularly important for
    use cases where response time to query in quasi (real time) is required and/or
    time between data production and ingestion by the processing and storage architecture
    is essential. (3) Network stability criterion translate the necessity to have
    a stable network or if is interruption can be tolerated. Use a value of * if the
    use case implemented can tolerate the absence of network during few hours; **
    if few minutes of interruption are tolerable; *** is stability of the network
    is an essential element of the use case. (4) The high throughput criterion expresses
    the capability of the architecture to process quickly a wide amount of data arriving
    at high frequency; Use a value of * if the data arrive mostly at regular intervals;
    a value of ** if the data arrive in bursts, and *** if the data arrive continuously
    at high frequency ( 10 Hz). (5) Reliability is a criterion that expresses if the
    infrastructure is critical in other terms whether an interruption in infrastructure
    could cause loss of life or not. Attribute a weight of * if the data is not critical
    and potential damages caused by an interruption of the architecture are minors
    or null; ** if potential damageable but tolerable if they occur more than once
    a year; *** if the application cannot tolerate any interruption which would cause
    irreversible damage or loss of human life. (6) Scalability is a criterion that
    expresses the regularity of the evolution in terms of processing and storage during
    a period of one year. If the scalability must be achieved at most once a year
    use a weight of *; if the scalability is achieved at most twice a year use **;
    if the scalability must be achieved more than two times by year use a weight of
    ***. (7) Cost-Effectiveness criterion reflects the need to control infrastructure
    costs. This criterion is more important as the infrastructure is brought to evolve
    both in terms of scale and complexity. Use the weight of * if the project will
    remain in a relatively constant size and do not need to be scaled or dramatically
    modified; Use **, if the project evolves reasonably, i.e. should not undergo significant
    modification more than once a year. Use a weight of *** if the size of the project
    and/ or its complexity need a fine study of cost. (8) Maintainability criterion
    is directly linked to the sustainability of the project. If the sustainability
    of the project will not exceed two years to allocate a point of *; if the life
    of the project is between 2 and 5 years, assign a score of ** beyond 5 years,
    assign ***. 4. Architectures The numerous publications dealing with cloud architectures
    relating to Agriculture 4.0, summarized in Table 2, show that a great deal of
    effort has been devoted to solving a whole range of problems related to many use
    cases. Indeed, a universal and a unique architecture do not exist for IoT applications
    in Smart Agriculture which ensure all needs of all use cases. This is the reason
    why several researchers have proposed various architectures which address specific
    issues of generic architectures. The Fig. 2 gives a global overview on Agriculture
    4.0 organization. Download : Download high-res image (340KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global structure of IoT in Agriculture 4.0. 4.1. Central
    Cloud Architectures Central Cloud Architectures are based on two basic architectures
    that are associated or combined in order to form modern architectures. These two
    architectures are: Batch Architecture aims to process an entire dataset in an
    offline mode. For this type of architectures, as long as the processing of the
    dataset is not finished, it continues and produces results only when it has reached
    its end. Generally, the data is selected and distributed to different nodes in
    order to be processed more quickly. When all the treatments are achieved on all
    nodes, the results are sorted and aggregated to obtain a global output. This architecture
    is easily implemented, and the aggregation is done by a framework, but processing
    times can be long, and data extracted during the treatment cannot be processed
    before the end of the treatment in progress. Furthermore, it is possible to increment
    results of previous batch and produce a result that integrates treated data in
    progress. Sallah et al. used a batch architecture to update data within the AquaCrop
    model (FAO) embedded in R-environment in order to facilitate model calibration
    and validation, run and evaluate all fields in a single run (Sallah et al., 2019).
    Nolack Fote et al. presented an architecture to extract knowledge on the long
    term from data in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) (Fote et al., 2020). Table
    5. Table 5. Pros and Cons of Batch Architecture. Pros Cons - Easy to implement
    and maintain. - Process only data previously stored in another form (file, database,
    etc). - Able to achieve long term treatments (several hours or days). - Processing
    cannot be modified before the end of the treatment. - Reprocessing of old data
    that are easy to achieve. - Results available only at the end of the treatment.
    Real-time Architecture also named Streaming Architecture processes data as it
    arrives, and results are progressively available by opposition to the batch architecture
    where it is not necessary to wait for the end of ingestion of all input data to
    obtain a result. The notion of real-time is strongly dependent on the analysis
    context with a processing time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Real-time
    architecture can be implemented in two different ways. On one hand with micro-batch
    in which a tiny amount of data is processed each n seconds and a result is obtained
    at the end of the treatment or on the other hand with a streaming approach in
    which each new data is immediately processed and output is quickly produced. This
    architecture is limited to data flow processing (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016).
    Table 6. Table 6. Pros and Cons of Real-time Architecture. Pros Cons - Allow a
    rapid treatment of newly arrived data. - Not able to achieve processing on large
    size of the batch. - Batch processing can be emulated using micro batches but
    not all algorithms can be implemented. - Reprocessing of old data difficult to
    implement. - Easy to implement and maintain. - The need for real-time processing
    involves the use of an estimator rather than the precise values that would take
    too long to be calculated. Various data are produced by different fields or animals
    sensors, vehicles, and robots of the Agriculture 4.0. Afterward, this data must
    be on one hand stored in a raw state and processed in an offline way where long
    and complex treatments can be achieved. On the other hand, data can be processed
    before its storing with offline processing, streaming processing, or a combination
    of these ones. The storage time is extremely variable following the nature of
    the data and their loss of value over time. Offline processing is classically
    used to process images from UAVs, UGVs, or satellites, for example, to determine
    photosynthesis activity, evaluate the canopy development or stocks of palatable
    species available in a pasture, etc. While Streaming processing allows detecting
    anomalies in animals’ behaviors in real-time, or during agricultural operations
    such as the harvesting, disease and pest detection, weeds elimination. In these
    last cases, data is not stored because it quickly loses all value after its ingestion.
    Finally, a combination of the two previous ways i.e. Offline and Streaming processing
    is used to estimate real-time metrics and achieve complex treatments in an offline
    way at the same time. This approach is used by milking robots which detect anomalies
    in the production in real-time while the offline processing estimates the future
    production of each cow based on previous milking (Debauche et al., 2021). Lambda
    architectures are used in systems that need to process and expose quickly massive
    amounts of streaming data. This cloud architecture was proposed by Nathan Marz
    and James Warren (Marz and Warren, 2013) to handle tremendous quantities of data
    and resolve complex problems combining processing large volumes of data (Batch)
    while incorporating the most recent data processed in real-time processes (Singh
    et al., 2019). This architecture is generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant against
    hardware failures and human mistakes. The architecture is composed of three layers:
    (1) batch layer process very large quantities of data by batch; (2) speed layer
    which processes data in real-time and provides views based on the most recent
    data and (3) serving layer responding to queries. Data comes from either a data
    source or a message queue. This paradigm allows executing arbitrary queries over
    any real-time data and is particularly adapted for critical infrastructure and
    health systems (Diaz et al., 2016). Several implementations of Lambda Architecture
    in smart Environment management, big data storage and analytics can be found in
    (Villari et al., 2014). Among the criticisms that have been made against lambda
    architecture is the need to make twice the developments for the real-time branch
    and the batch branch. It is possible to perform a batch processing and in real
    time with flow processing is what the Kappa architecture described below does
    (Kreps, 2014). Fig. 3 Table 7. Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download

    Pros and Cons of Lambda Architecture. Pros Cons - Process data in real-time or
    in batch processing in separate ways. The reliability of two ways of treatment
    is most costly than other architectures if the two execute the same treatment.
    Among use cases in agriculture 4.0 using a lambda, we would like to highlight:
    Roukh et al. proposed WALLeSMART, a cloud platform based on lambda and specifically
    developed for Smart Farming. This platform implements Apache Kafka to store temporary
    data before their treatment. Apache Hadoop and the programming model Mapreduce
    is used for the batch processing while Apache Storm process data in realtime.
    The originality of this architecture is the coupling of a NoSQL database Apache
    Casandra and a SQL database, PostgreSQL where data is stored in the function of
    its nature. The GraphQL query language allows to querying databases. (Roukh et
    al., 2020, Roukh et al., 2020). Debauche et al. describe a lambda architecture
    for digital phenotyping (Debauche et al., 2020) and farm animals’ behaviors coupled
    with an Application Hosting Architecture based on Apache Mesos and Docker containerization
    to facilitate the deployment of various applications. An API interconnects and
    controls accesses between the Lambda Architecture and the Hosting Application
    Architecture. The Lambda architecture is based on Apache Beam to easily change
    the runner in the function of the technology evolution and improve its sustainability.
    Apache Druid is used to store time series data (Debauche et al., 2019) and metadata
    of data stored in the Datalake based on Apache Hadoop (Debauche et al., 2018).
    A variant of this architecture, named Unified Lambda architecture combines batch
    and stream pipelines which runs concurrently, and then the results are merged
    automatically (Siciliani, 2015). AllJoyn Lambda integrates AllJoyn a framework
    that offers: (1) proximal devices and applications discovering; (2) specific devices
    framework adapting; (3) transmission between devices with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.;
    (4) interoperability between operating systems; (5) efficient and secure data
    exchange through D-BUS (Villari et al., 2014). The Kappa architecture, proposed
    by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014), simplifies the Lambda architecture by
    combining real-time and batch layers. This cloud architecture differs from the
    Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent storage system of data in an unchangeable
    log file such as system as Apache Spark or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow
    only storage for a limited time in order to allow an eventual reprocessing of
    these data. Batch and Speed Layers are also replaced by a stream processing engine.
    So, the Kappa Architecture is composed of two layers: streaming and serving layers
    and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe messaging like Apache Kafka, which
    facilitates data ingestion. Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (121KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Kappa Architecture General Scheme.
    The main advantage of this architecture is its simplicity. It avoids having to
    maintain two separate code bases for the batch and speed layers. When processing
    on real-time and historical data are the same, a Kappa Architecture must be used.
    Fast Data Architecture is a variant of Kappa Architecture in which the data are
    no longer read from files but from an additional mechanism like Kafka that captures
    multiple streams combines them before being processed by the speed layer (Lakhe,
    2016). Persico et al. achieved a benchmark of Lambda and Kappa architectures and
    show that Lambda outperforms Kappa for social networks data (YFCC100M) processing
    (Persico et al., 2018). Table 8. Table 8. Pros and Cons of Kappa Architecture.
    Pros Cons - Very efficient for real-time processing thanks to in-memory processing.
    - Batch processing emulates thanks to micro-batch treated via the real-time way.
    - Optimized cost because allows real-time and batch processing. - Not able to
    process large batch size. - Must be finely tuned from data to obtain the best
    performances (Nkamla Penka et al., 2021). Other Architectures derived or inspired
    of the previous architectures have been developed to address specific problems
    such as (1) SMACK (Estrada and Ruiz, 2016) which attempts to propose an optimal
    architecture with fixed components; (2) Liquid (Fernandez et al., 2015) is an
    architecture which provide low latency, incremental processing, high available
    with isolated resource, and able to store high throughput data at low operational
    cost architecture; (3) Butterfly (Lakhe, 2016) proposes to unify batch, speed
    and serving layers in a unique platform in which data are organized as a collection
    of three types of abstractions; (4) Zeta (Scott, 2015) which integrates a lambda
    architecture with business aspect of the enterprise; (5) BRAID (Giebler et al.,
    2018) is a hybrid processing architecture where all coming data and configuration
    file of processing, and eventually processing results written back are stored
    in a shared storage; (6) IoT-a (Hausenblas, 2014) is composed of three blocks:
    Ad-hoc queries, a Database, and a Distributed File System; (7) Polystore (Meehan
    et al., 2016) implements a multiple database system PostgreSQL, SciDB and Accumulo
    because a database alone cannot store all types of data efficiently. Table 9.

    analysis of the literature achieved shows that two major generic architectures:
    Kappa and Lambda allows to address of various use cases and are widely implemented
    and proven in other domains of the Internet of Things. The Lambda is more expensive
    to implement than the Kappa because of the need to maintain two separate parallel
    processing branches for stream processing and batch processing. It is interesting
    if different processing are carried out on the two processing branches. Otherwise,
    a Kappa architecture with a single processing branch that processes both the streams
    and the data in batches is more appropriate in most cases because it is cheaper
    and easier to maintain because a single code performs both types of processing
    (stream and batch). Looking at our first two research questions, we observe that
    Lambda and Kappa cloud architectures are efficient but these architectures alone
    operating in central cloud cannot address, for example, use cases where very low
    latencies are required. They will have to be hybridized and completed to address
    these particular cases. Two possibilities are available to us. The first way consists
    in associating several specialized cloud platforms to make it possible to obtain
    greater genericity or at least to better cover a domain. The second consists of
    supplementing the cloud-centric architectures that we have just mentioned with
    other architectural elements in order to better address the specific needs of
    Agriculture 4.0. 4.2. Extension of the cloud paradigm With the increase of the
    amount of data produced by the myriad of connected things, the amount of data
    to process, to transfer by network, and to treat in the cloud computing have called
    into question the architecture of storage and data processing. To solve the problem,
    two ways have been proposed, the first is Multi-Cloud Computing, the objective
    of which is to ensure redundancy in order to improve latency. The second is the
    Federated Cloud with the aim of pooling resources for better use. Multi-Cloud
    Computing (MCC) (Manyika and Chui, 2015) is an extension of Cloud Computing paradigm
    where services are distributed on multi-clouds. In this architecture the workflow
    is distributed entirely in the cloud, data redundancy is also verified. One advantage
    of the MCC is the high recovery rate but it has the same disadvantages as Cloud
    Computing, along with complexity and portability issues. Kazim et al. proposed
    a framework to deliver IoT services and establish cooperation across multi-clouds.
    An authentication allows communicating cloud to authenticate each other cloud
    dynamically. While a service selects the best IoT service matching with user requirements
    among multiple clouds and taking into account the SLA parameters agreed between
    the user and the provider (Kazim et al., 2018). Federated Cloud (FC) aggregates
    resources of multiple cloud providers to improve users’ freedom and allows users
    to choose where they want to deploy their applications. A Federated cloud can
    be defined as a voluntary collaboration between heterogeneous cloud providers
    collaborating to share their own unused resources. Using a cloud federation helps
    to ensure service performance during load ups with resources borrowed from other
    clouds. In addition, the geographical dispersion of the installations makes it
    possible to migrate to another installation and to guarantee the service in case
    of breakdown. A unified interface allows to use it an easy consultation of the
    offered services. Finally, thanks to the dynamic distribution of the load, it
    is possible to bring the treatment closer to the user and consequently improve
    the Quality of Service (Assis and Bittencourt, 2016). Cloud federations include
    European Federated Cloud (Sipos et al., 2013), Massachusetts Open Cloud, Mosaic
    (Petcu et al., 2013), IEEE P2302, and Open stack Keystone. Drakos et al. described
    agINFA, a common research data infrastructure for agriculture, food and the environment
    using EGI Federated Cloud. This infrastructure allows to partner to share research
    infrastructure components, APIs, a registry of web-based information service and
    dataset for agriculture (Drakos et al., 2015). 4.3. Distributed architectures
    The post-cloud approaches allow to improve latency and jitter for immobile entities
    but do not provide an answer adapted for mobile devices and local awareness. The
    large amount of data generated at the edge has increased the speed of data transportation
    that is becoming the bottleneck for the cloud-based computing paradigms (Shi et
    al., 2016). Moreover, the treatment of data in the cloud does not offer any guarantees
    about privacy, on the response time and real-time actuation because the huge number
    of devices increases the latency and jitter. Moreover, the mobility of devices
    and power constraints makes the communicaion difficult with the cloud all the
    time (Botta et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017). The aim has been to bring data storage
    and processes data, filtering, and data analysis closer to data-producing objects
    to limit bandwidth consumption and relieve the cloud. Three major paradigms have
    been proposed to address these issues and bring cloud computing-like capabilities
    to the edge of the network. All these infrastructures manage mechanisms of Virtual
    Machine (VM) or containers migration and adjust if needed, the provisioning of
    capabilities where users are located. Moreover, the three paradigms allow the
    creation of federated infrastructures in which can coexist multiple edge infrastructures
    which can exchange information and services (Roman et al., 2018). 4.4. Elements
    of distributed architectures In order to always bring closer, the processing capacities
    of intermediate processing have been set up between connected objects and the
    cloud at the network level (Fog Computing) and at the level of telephony providers
    (Mobile Edge Computing). Fog Computing is a concept created by Cisco Systems and
    is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm (Munir et al., 2017) in which
    computation, storage and network services are provided between end devices and
    cloud/ classify and analyze the raw IoT data streams at near-edge and edge network
    level (Cisco, 2018). Fog nodes are either physical components such as gateways,
    switches, routers, servers etc. or virtual components such as virtualized switches,
    virtual machines, cloudlets, etc.; deployed following private, community, public
    or hybrid. Private nodes are reserved for a single organization, community nodes
    are used by a community, public nodes are dedicated to the general public, and
    hybrid mix the third previous modalities (Uehara, 2017). This paradigm allows
    to limit data transfer on cloud, reduce latency (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), and
    jitter thanks to a three-tier architecture (Roman et al., 2018). In this hierarchical
    architecture, the analysis of local information is achieved at the low level and
    the coordination and global analysis are performed at the top level. The Fog Computing
    supports mobile devices (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), response time in real-time
    or predictable latency (Lopez et al., 2015), bandwidth saving, an improving of
    security and resilience, scalability, multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, and automation
    (Byers, 2017), cost-effective services (Yang, 2017). Fog Computing allows also
    the federation of fog infrastructures in order to allow cooperation between multiple
    organizations (Roman et al., 2018). Furthermore, the architecture is optimized
    for a use case and applications which must run on them (Byers, 2017). Fog Computing
    differentiates from cloud computing mainly by the proximity with end-users at
    the edge of networks localized or distributed geographically consisting in many
    relatively less resourceful (Munir et al., 2017). In addition to network equipment,
    fog computing can also be carried out in cloudlets and micro data centers. Cloudlets
    were proposed to address the end-to-end responsiveness between mobile devices
    and associated clouds. Cloudlets (Mach and Becvar, 2017) are micro data center
    geographically deployed in vicinity of End Users. This mobility-enhanced small-scale
    cloud data center is composed of computers with high computation power which provide
    both computation resources and storage. Cloudlet is much more agile (highly dynamic
    provisioning) than cloud due to user mobility churning. The mobility of users
    implies the use of a virtual machine to rapidly instantiate compute-intensive
    and latency-intensive applications and migrate the offloaded services between
    different cloudlet in the function of the user mobility. Cloudlets must be firstly
    discovered, selected among several candidates before starting provisioning. At
    the end of the session, the instance is destroyed (Ai et al., 2018). Cloudlets
    are accessed by mobile user equipment via Wi-Fi imply a high latency caused by
    the network and switch between mobile network and Wi-Fi and by consequence Quality
    of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) are hard to fulfill (Mach and
    Becvar, 2017, Manyika and Chui, 2015). Moreover, Cloudlets cover usually a small
    region and do not offer any guarantee on ubiquitous computing and scalability
    in service (Manyika and Chui, 2015). MicroData Centers (MDCs) were proposed by
    Microsoft Research. It is designed to extend cloud data centers as cloudlets.
    MDCs are enclosures contemning all types of equipments (computing, storage, network)
    needed to provide a secure computing environment in order to run customs applications
    requiring low latency. MDCs are also well adapted to provide processing resources
    to end devices on battery or with limited computing capabilities. MDCs can be
    adapted in function network bandwidth and user needs thanks to certain flexibility
    in terms of latency and scalability of the capacity (Wang et al., 2020). Guardo
    et al. proposed a framework composed of two fog layers respectively filtering
    and aggregating data, and clustering analysis, actuation management, and alert.
    The framework aims to improve computational load balancing between fog and cloud
    in order to reduce the amount of data to transmit to the cloud, reduce the waiting
    time for the user (Guardo et al., 2018). Taneja et al. proposed a SmartHerd an
    IoT platform dedicated to smart dairy farming based on microservices and Fog-assisted.
    The IoT gateway received data from transceivers, archived data aggregation, preprocessing,
    classification, feature selection, send critical alerts to farmers, and transmit
    data to IBM Watson IoT platform via MQTT protocol. In the IBM Watson IoT platform,
    a broker picks up data and store them in a Cloudant NoSQL JSON Database. Python
    Virtual Machine and Java Virtual Machine were used as containers equivalent for
    microservices deployment at fog level (Taneja et al., 2019). Sharofidinov et al.
    described a 4 layers architecture (Sensors Layers, Fog Layer, Network/Cloud Layer,
    and Application Layer) based on LoRa to monitor and predict the state of a greenhouse
    from a random forest algorithm. In the Sensor Layer, sensors acquire temperature,
    soil and air humidity, CO2 rate, and illumination connected to TTGO LoRa32 (ESP32
    with LoRa Sx1276 chip) which are transmitted to the gateway by LoRa. At Fog Layer,
    preliminary analysis with Machine Learning algorithm, diagnosis of sensor status,
    and data compression are achieved. In the Network/Cloud Layer, compressed data
    are transmitted in order to be deeply analyzed and stored. Finally, in the Application
    Layer, analyzed data are converted in readable form to allows the monitoring and
    the control of the greenhouse (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Table 10. Table 10.
    Pros and Cons of Fog Computing. Pros Cons - Fast response time in avoiding transmission
    of data to the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). - Failure or outage of the gateway
    can defeat thousands of devices. - The local storage and processing capabilities
    prevent data loss and outages when the Internet connectivity is limited (Sharofidinov
    et al., 2020). - The limited processing and memory capacities do not allow the
    deployment of algorithms requiring significant resources or the carrying out of
    long-term processing. - Sensitive data can be filtered locally. In this case,
    only the data model is moved in the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020), and data
    validation, compression, and encryption. - Gateway at fog level ensure the compatibility
    between old and modern devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020) and various protocols
    for communication. - Improve the resilience thanks to the decentralization of
    the treatment on network devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) was proposed by ETSI and is deployed by telecommunication companies on the
    edge of the network, which is characterized by ultra-low latency and high bandwidth.
    (Roman et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2017). At the very beginning, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) aims to bring real-time, high-bandwidth, and low-latency access to dependent
    applications known as cloud computing capabilities; in addition to, information
    technology (IT) features of cloud computing. MEC is distributed at the edge of
    the network. In fact, a new class of cloud-native applications are easily accessible,
    because of the close position of Edge Computing to the end user and apps. Also,
    it allows network operators to open their environment to a new ecosystem. As a
    result of this significant change, MEC application can be used in LTE macro base
    stations (eNBs), 3G radio network controllers (RNCs), Wi-Fi access points, edge
    network routers, and enterprise edge servers. MEC platform contains two main hosting
    infrastructures. The first is formed by hardware resources and a high-resolution
    screen. The second is composed of manageable applications with numerous capabilities
    such as the application of virtualization manager and platform services (Zhou
    et al., 2017). An important challenge for the MEC is the VM migration that must
    optimize the tradeoff between migration gain and migration cost and select optimal
    location (Ai et al., 2018). Tran et al. investigated the collaborative Mobile
    Edge Computing in 5G Networks. MEC extends processing and storage resources at
    the edge of the Radio Access Network (RAN) while C-RAM is based on centralization
    of the base Station by means of the virtualization. Authors argue that both technologies
    are complementary in the 5G ecosystem (Tran et al., 2017). Fig. 5 Table 11. Download

    Mobile Edge Computing General Scheme. Table 11. Pros and Cons of MEC. Pros Cons
    - Reduces needs in connection, response time delay, the congestion of other parts
    of the network (Valecce et al., 2019). - Usable only for devices connected in
    Wi-Fi or 3GPP. - Use low level message from Wi-Fi to determine the location of
    each device (Location awareness) (Valecce et al., 2019). - MEC Server can be used
    as power open to applications and services (Valecce et al., 2019). Fan et al.
    combined MEC with data link management, combining with the industrial CAN bus
    characteristics to monitor water. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Altera
    implementing the AVALON bus was used to implement the system. Moreover, they propose
    a protocol to model random network disturbances and an online task offloading
    algorithm based on the monitoring of task execution (Fan and Gao, 2018). Valecce
    et al. proposed a 5G-robotics reference architecture for smart agriculture composed
    of UAV-Based Monitoring and connectivity, Machinery automation, and MEC Applications
    Server. UAVs/satellites capture high-resolution images during patrolling, which
    coupled with sensors data trigger a precise crop management. UAVs can also collect
    data or serve as a 5G mobile station. In field, image processing coupled with
    sensors data can be used for decision making. MEC allows to process gigabyte/s
    of data produced by autonomous vehicles and robots (Valecce et al., 2019). Table

    ** ** Maintainability ** ** The development of fog computing and its counterpart
    for MEC wireless networks allow processing capabilities closer to users to improve

    are inherently two questions: Which association strategies to use between the
    cloud and the other levels of processing in the network? How to distribute the
    load between these different levels: local (Edge), network (Fog), and Cloud processing.
    4.5. Collaborative computing strategies In order to address, our fourth research
    question, we try to identify different possibilities to compose architectural
    elements. Indeed, different collaboration strategies between the different levels
    of data processing (cloud, fog, edge) can be considered depending on the particularities
    of the use cases. In the next paragraphs, we describe possibilities of collaboration
    between different treatment entries, and we illustrate each one with few examples.
    Edge-Cloud aims to connect devices directly with the cloud that performs data
    processing. This strategy is often used by UAVs and UGVs which preprocess data
    before its transfer to the cloud because image treatment needs processing power
    and storage capabilities. The default of this approach is that the delay of the
    whole process from data transfer via high throughput wireless or cellular protocol
    to the transmission of processing results cannot be guaranteed because of the
    fluctuation of data rates linked to wireless networks (Wang et al., 2020). The
    processing of data can be achieved in an online mode with a real-time data transmission
    and processing by a stream, Lambda, Kappa or derived architecture of these one.
    An offline strategy with a data transfer by means of a computer and Internet connection
    on the cloud after the UAV fly and processing with a Batch, a Lambda, or a Kappa
    architecture or a derived architecture of these one is also possible. This latter
    costly avoid data transmission and is suitable for monitoring crops or livestock
    that do not require direct action. Agriculture 4.0 uses in particular Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors in order to improve the time
    of data collection, in reducing the cost of acquisition compared to traditional
    field phenotyping technologies. According to Tang et al., edge-cloud is majorly
    used in smart robots to reduce complexity (Tang et al., 2021). Indeed, the images
    of drones to be used must be orthorectified and assembled. These operations require
    significant resources in terms of computing power, and memory. All these collected
    data must be rapidly processed, analyzed, and visualized. Agroview (Ampatzidis
    et al., 2020) is a platform that developed a cloud and AI-based application to
    survey and assess the agriculture field, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    A website allows the upload of images or existing orthomosaic, the consultation
    for each tree field e.g., number of trees, tree gaps count, area of the field,
    the average height of trees, canopy area, etc. The website also allows the stitching
    of an orthomosaic and the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM). A tree
    detection algorithm developed in C allows the detection of individual tree and
    tree gap, and estimate tree parameters such as height, canopy area, health/stress
    estimation. The pipeline of treatment uses a Faster R-CNN to detect the region
    of interest (ROI) and the ResNet101 network allows to detect trees and row orientation.
    Afterward, the Yolo classifier using Darknet19 was applied along each row of trees
    to obtain a more precise detection. Debauche et al. presented an Edge-Cloud architecture
    for the analysis of cattle behavior from 9-DOF IMU data sampled at 100 Hz and
    GPS location sampled at 0.5 Hz that is then processed with an algorithm proposed
    by (Andriamandroso et al., 2017) in batch processing (Debauche et al., 2019, Debauche
    et al., 2020). Popescu et al. proposed an integrated system UAV-WSN-IoT where
    WSN data is collected by UAVs before their transmission to the ground control
    station and afterward to the cloud (Popescu et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    an architecture for scientific research dedicated to honeybee Colony Collapse
    Disorder. In this architecture, data is compressed on LoPy at the edge level before
    its collection by the LoRaWan gateway and its transmission to the Lambda architecture
    in the cloud where it is processed (Debauche et al., 2018). Edge-Fog aims to connect
    devices directly with network components such as gateways, routers that perform
    data processing. The major benefits of this approach are an optimization of the
    bandwidth, a reduction of traffic and latency, a better privacy, and an improved
    security level (Badidi, 2020). Fog nodes collect, aggregate, filter, encrypt,
    compress, and process IoT data (Gupta et al., 2020). This way is used for example
    by milking robots where data are processed by a computer close the robot and can
    be viewed remotely by the farmer. 5G also promotes mobile edge computing (MEC).
    Debauche et al. presented an AI-IoT architecture for the deployment of Artificial
    intelligence algorithms and Internet of things services at fog level using docker
    containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. This architecture has been developed
    to automatically deploy AI algorithms after retraining when performances (accuracy,
    recall, precision) are improved (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    a Multi-Agent System (MAS) deployed at edge level allowing to control abnormal
    data present in sensed data and eventually cure this data when it is possible.
    The MAS simultaneously manages pivot irrigation, plant diseases and pests'' detection,
    and their curation. The data is partially transmitted to the cloud to improve
    the detection of diseases and pests and retrain AI algorithms before their redeployment
    at the edge level (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. described a fog architecture
    in which a Gated Recursive Unit (GRU) algorithm is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano
    for real-time poultry monitoring. GRU is simpler than LSTM algorithm. GRU is built
    to avoid varnish gradient problems. Periodically data is transmitted to the user
    interface implemented in NodeJS in the cloud (Debauche et al., 2020). Edge-Fog-Cloud
    is a paradigm in which data are partially processed in the fog and more complex
    treatments are achieved in the cloud. This way is used by wireless Sensor and
    Actuator Network (WSAN), which passes through a gateway that provides interconnection
    between the devices and the backhaul which transit then data to the cloud. However,
    the right balance between cloud and edge/fog computing is required (Badidi, 2020)
    based on available resources and whether or not the task is sensitive. Taneja
    et al. used a strategy Edge-Fog-Cloud to develop a detection system of lameness
    for cattle. The data from the pedometer is transmitted to the Fog node by means
    of a Long-Range proprietary protocol at 433 MHz on a distance of 2 km. Fog node
    stores in local database, preprocess and aggregates them. Fog node communicates
    with IBM Watson IoT Platform with MQTT protocol. Arriving data are picked up and
    stored in Cloudant NoSQL JSON database in IBM cloud. A mobile application synchronizes
    data with PouchDB, its local database via the REST API of Cloudant database when
    an Internet connection is available (Taneja et al., 2020). Alonso et al. presented
    Global Edge Computing Architecture (GECA), a modular tiered architecture (IoT
    Layer, Edge Layer, Business Solution Layer) to monitor dairy and feed grain state
    in real-time. In this architecture, a Distributed Ledger Technologies provides
    security from IoT Layer to Business Solution Layer. In the IoT layer, a set of
    agents call oracles to verify incoming data and afterward calculate hash of data
    with SHA-256 which is stored in the blockchain to verify the non-alteration of
    data. In parallel data is encrypted with the RSA algorithm and then sent to the
    Edge layer. The Edge Layer is responsible of the preprocessing of data and filters
    out data transmitted to the cloud. It enables also various data analyses. In the
    business Solution Layer, final storage, authentication, analysis for decision
    making is achieved. It provides also a knowledge base and APIs (Alonso et al.,
    2020). Edge-Edge is a paradigm in which devices interact to collaborate, exchange,
    and process data. The deployment of the 5G network allows the interconnection
    between UAVs and UGVs/ agricultural machinery (Tang et al., 2021). This high throughput
    network will allow to developping new collaboration between UAVs/ UGVs and agricultural
    machinery, for example, a drone will provide information to a harvester to avoid
    a non-desirable area of the field or avoid obstacles. A fleet of drones can also
    collaborate to coordinate their operations on the field between them of course
    subject to availability in rural areas, a transmission network with sufficient
    bandwidth and short-latency or capabilities to communicate between them in direct
    connection or in a mesh network. (Tang et al., 2021). Four cooperation strategies
    have been identified, two of which use the cloud, namely Fog-Cloud and Edge-Cloud.
    The other two remaing, do not involve the cloud; namely, Fog-Edge, and Edge-Edge
    cloud. The first two strategies complement the cloud to help us to address issues
    relating to production data and trade secrets, network congestion, and response
    times. The other two strategies do without the cloud and therefore assume that
    the devices/ vehicles have sufficient capacity to perform the processing. Despite
    these cooperation strategies between different levels of processing, some questions
    remain unanswered: How to store all the raw data when the data is so important
    that it would take colossal means to process it? What about security? How to organize
    the distribution of tasks between the edge, the fog, and the cloud? How to ensure
    operation and/ or treatment when network connections are intermittent or faulty?
    How to improve the maintainability of these architectures? These are the questions
    that the new trends that we describe in the next paragraph attempt to answer.
    5. New trends In this section, we present two emerging architectures not based
    on the batch or/and real-time architectures or their derivatives. Afterward, we
    describe Osmotic and Dew computing as two new paradigms, which allow us to respectively
    choose where the processing must be achieved and improve the user experience.
    New trends are additional elements that allow enriching the analysis of Section
    4 in order to address the third research question. The Microservices Architecture
    (MA) is a new system software design pattern that divides complex monolithic application
    in micro services dedicated for a single function. Microservice addresses defects
    of monolithic applications in which improving of service performance needs multiple
    deployment; a change in a function can affect all the monolith due to high dependencies
    between components; all the monolith uses a sole technology stack and development
    standards which limits possibilities to solve problems of physical heterogeneity.
    The advantages of this architecture are using a lightweight communication mechanism
    to interact between services with a minimal overload (Sun et al., 2017). The design
    proposed by (Sun et al., 2017) is composed of 8 microservices (Geo, Security,
    Tenant, Devices, Big Data, Automation, AI, and Application) and a core service
    coordinating. These services provide respectively: (1) Geo, a GIS layer to render
    data; (2) Security, user/group/role management, access control, administration,
    and authentication mechanism; (3) support for multiple IoT applications with a
    single core; (4) device plugins and communication protocols for sensing and actuating;
    (5) scalable persistence to store data; (6) process, analyze events and notify
    appropriate participant; (7) Artificial intelligence tools for IoT big data; (8)
    components to interact with client interfaces; (9) support for data exchanging
    by message with the devices. Authors argue that their approach is more flexible,
    scalable and platform-independent. Fig. 6 Table 13. Download : Download high-res

    General Scheme. Table 13. Pros and Cons of Microservices Architecture. Pros Cons
    - Fractionating of monoliths facilitates the maintainability and scalability of
    low coupled microservices. - Need to find microservice adapted with needs. - The
    discovery of micro-services allows the development new applications more easily
    than with monoliths. Fraction complex monolith is not easy. - More resilient,
    when a microservice is down, all others continue to function. Bixio et al. proposed
    a stream processing architecture event-driven based on proxy, adapter, and data
    processing microservices. This architecture extends the IoT platform Senseioty
    and using the Java OSGi framework (Bixio et al., 2020). The Data Lake Architecture
    (DLA) (Fang, 2015, Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016) enables the storage of large
    volumes of data of all types: raw data in its native format, structured, semi-structured,
    in a cost-effective manner. In this architecture, data is stored in its native
    format until it needs to process them by engines (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016),
    which allows a fast transformation and refinement of stored data regardless of
    the amount of data stored. The architecture makes it possible to consume all types
    of data (logs, web services, database, files, etc.); different ingestion systems
    consume the data and then stored it in data repository. Once the data is stored,
    query systems can query the data lake. This architecture is considered in the
    corporate world as an evolution of existing architectures. The advantage of the
    Data Lake architecture is that it can easily and inexpensively store large amounts
    of data. It is particularly well suited to storing data in a typical format. In
    Enterprise Data Lakes are used; in addition to, data warehouses. Data lakes are,
    however, unsuitable for assessing data quality, data can be placed in data lakes
    without content control, and performance is also poorer than on specially designed
    and optimized infrastructures. The Lakehouse is a variant of the Data Lake where
    storages of data are generally achieved with Hadoop in the data lake is replaced
    by a distributed storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
    and analysis are directly achieved by infrastructure managed by Cloud Service
    Providers such as Amazon Athena, EMR, or Databricks, Google Data proc, Azure HDInsight.

    Data lake and Lakehouse General Scheme. It crucial in agriculture to explore datasets
    from different sources. The data lake is indicated to manage the complexity of
    agricultural ecosystems and centralized all data sources to find new correlations.
    (Madera et al., 2017). A data lake provides views based on metadata. It is nevertheless
    necessary to have advanced analysis tools for predictive modeling and statistical
    analysis. López et al. used a data lake to achieve the fusion of data from different
    domains in smart the agriculture context (López et al., 2020). Gallinucci et al.
    (Gallinucci et al., 2019, Gallinucci et al., 2020) present an innovative architecture
    3 tiers architecture, called Mo.Re.Farming (MOnitoring and REmote system for a
    more sustainable FARMING) based on a data lake using Apache Hadoop and storing
    structured, semi-structured, and unstructured raw data, and in which subsequent
    processing and enrichment activities are separated. An Operational Data Store
    (ODS) using PostgreSQL with PostGIS to stores structured and detailed data and
    address limitations of big data solutions in properly handling continuous field
    geographic data. Finally, a spatial cube enables Spatial OnLine Analytical Processing
    (SOLAP). Neves et al. described an architecture in which raw data is stored in
    a datalake. Then, ETLs transforms data to be storable in a database. The data
    is enriched thanks to a knowledge base and its exploration by data mining algorithms
    (machine learning). The result of processing is filtered to improve the quality
    of structured data (Neves and Cruvinel, 2020). Table 14. Table 14. Pros and Cons
    of Datalake/DataHouse. Pros Cons - Store the data in its raw form without transforming
    them immediately. - Availability of results depend of the ingesting speed by processing
    services. - Allow store massive low-value data without investing energy to transform
    and store them in a database. - Data analysis by sampling does not give exact
    results but is estimated. - Provides a solution to situations where the volume
    of data is so large that it can no longer be processed immediately - Data House
    may be limited by the services offered by cloud providers for data analysis. Osmotic
    Computing (OC) (Villari et al., 2016) is a new paradigm inspired by the chemical
    osmosis process that corresponds to a dynamic and bidirectional flow of microservices
    between cloud and edge. OC exploits container-based solution to allows an automatic
    deployment of portable, mobile, and cross-platform microservices between Edge
    and cloud levels (Villari et al., 2016). Osmotic computing introduces the concept
    of Micro Elements (MELS) which decouples user data and applications in Micro Services
    (MS) i.e. a docker container and Micro Data (MD) i.e. an entity self-explicative
    in JSON. MS associates one operating system (Micro Operation Service) with an
    application (Micro User Service) while MD associates a microservice configuration
    (Micro Operational Data) and User data (Micro User Data). These MELS can be deployed
    on Microcontrollers (MCU) or Multiprocessor (MPU) (Villari et al., 2017). Table
    15. Table 15. Pros and Cons of Osmotic Computing. Pros Cons - Micro Element (microservice  +
    micro dataset) easy to migrate between fog and cloud. - All datasets are not decomposable
    in micro dataset. The bidirectional migration of microservices between Edge and
    Cloud must, on one hand, avoid application breakdown and QoS degradation and on
    the other hand manage them dynamically, in high heterogeneously physical resources
    context, in the function of infrastructure and applications requirements (Villari
    et al., 2016). Carnevale et al. have applied osmotic computing to the Internet
    of Things by means of a distributed multi-agent system. Each agent is self-orchestrated,
    works independently, and manages the workflow as a composition of MELs. It monitors
    the overloading state of microservices by means of response time metric and decides
    to relocate them to another agent based on a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
    or Time Series Analysis (Carnevale et al., 2019). Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Download : Download

    image Fig. 9. Osmotic Computing General Scheme. In an IoT context, OC allows to
    deploy lightweight micro services at edge level while complex micro services are
    deployed at fog/cloud level, and balance load between edge, fog, and cloud. (Maksimović,
    2018). Morshed et al. proposed to use OC to distribute Deep Learning across edge,
    cloud, and mobile edge in a holistic way (Morshed et al., 2017). However, Kaur
    et al. in their Osmotic Computing applications survey have identified the need
    of standardization in terms of infrastructure deployment and micro-services distribution.
    The orchestration is crucial to manage efficient services. Security remains an
    important challenge because the service migration is supported by different layers
    (Kaur et al., 2020). Dew Computing (DC) (Skala et al., 2015) allows to further
    improve response times by pushing from Central cloud to end-users, computing applications,
    data, and low-level services. Client microcomputers are used to store a part of
    the data locally in the background and to limit access to the cloud, reduce network
    dependency and drastically reduce processing cost (Skala et al., 2015). Dew computing
    is the additional piece of cloud computing. It is mainly composed of a wide range
    of heterogeneous devices and varied equipment ranging from smartphones to smart
    sensors (Wang, 2016). DC is highly and effectively capable in terms of scalability
    and ability to perform sophisticated operations and to process numerous applications
    and tools. Additionally, the equipment of DC is ad hoc programmable and self-adaptive.
    They have the qualifications to running the process within another process in
    a distributed way without a focal communication network (Skala et al., 2015).
    Applications running in the on-premises computers provide services to users and/or
    devices independently of the cloud but collaborating with cloud services (Wang,
    2016). DC can provide access web fraction without Internet connection (WiD), Storage
    in dew has a cloud copy (STiD), Local database has a cloud backup (DBiD), Software
    ownership and settings have a cloud copy (SiD), SDK and projects have a cloud
    copy (PiD), On-premises computer settings and data have a cloud copy (IaD), Other
    services (DiD) (Wang, 2016). The Fig. 10 presents the dew computing in the general
    scheme Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing. Table 16. Download : Download high-res image

    Table 16. Pros and Cons of Dew Computing. Pros Cons - Allows access to a local
    copy of data when the connection is unavailable. - Replication of data is bandwidth-consuming.
    - Improve the reliability and the false tolerance. - Difficult to exploit if bandwidth
    is insufficient. Rajakaruna et al. presented a dew architecture based on a drone
    to retrieve and process data, manage WSN, and play the role of dew server. The
    drone communicates with sensors, and actuators with BLE protocol, collect, store
    data, and then when the drone is at the docking station it sends data to the cloud
    (Rajakaruna et al., 2018). Grovers et al. described a reliable and fault-tolerant
    architecture at 4 levels (edge, dew, fog, and cloud) in which sensed data is replicated
    at edge, fog and cloud level in order to take over the application’s control when
    a server is failed. In their architecture, dew servers are closed and linked with
    sensors producing data. The fault tolerance is ensured by mobile agents working
    as a resource exchanging the application and link-state information between us,
    and the network monitoring agent (Grover and Garimella, 2018). The Blockchain
    is a distributed digital ledger of transaction distributed maintained by a network
    of multiple computing nodes. This ledger can be deployed among the IoT nodes network
    (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). In the blockchain, transactions namely blocks are
    managed by a specific software platform ensuring the data transmission, processing
    and storage, and its representation in a human-readable form allowing a consistent
    view and a consensus between the participants (Kamilaris et al., 2019). Different
    mechanisms of consensus whose two main ones are the “Proof of Work (PoW)” and
    the Proof of Stake (PoS). The PoW requires the solving of difficult computational
    tasks before validating transactions and the adding of the block in the blockchain.
    In this approach “miners” are in competition to be the first and obtain the rewards,
    which has an impact on the environment, need expending large a amount of computer
    and energy, and involves a risk of centralization. While the PoS approach, “validators”
    are randomly selected with a probability which depends on the amount of stake
    held. At the end of the validation process, it earns a fee. Other less used consensus
    mechanisms exist such as (1) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) in which each node generates
    a random wait time and goes to sleep for that specified duration; (2) Simplified
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), an improvement of Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT) specifically designed for blockchain in which each new block
    is maintained by a delegation of nodes with increasing authority. Each one uses
    the internal time to decide when actions must be done; (3) Proof of Authority
    (PoA) in which approved accounts process to the automated validation of transaction
    and blocks. Table 17. Table 17. Pros and Cons of Blockchain. Pros Cons - Data
    distributed (Alonso et al., 2020). - Energy consumption for the complex signature
    verification process can be important. - Immutable, durable, verifiable, secure,
    and transparent (Alonso et al., 2020). - Not adapted to store images, video. -

    Fig. 11. Blockchain General Scheme. The block chain is mainly used in Agriculture
    to make the data of the supply chain transparent and open (Bermeo-Almeida et al.,
    2018) and ensure the complete traceability of the food chain from the fork to
    the plate. The block chain allows to record information about: (1) Transactions
    between provider and farmer as well as information relating to the crops, material
    and chemical products; (2) The farm, cultivation practices and management, animals
    feeding, and complementary information such as weather conditions, animals welfare,
    diseases, treatment, etc; (3) Information about factory and its equipment, the
    processing method, batch numbers but also financial transactions with producers
    and distributors; (4) Warehousing, storage conditions (temperature, humidity),
    methods of transport, transit time, and all financial transactions between the
    distributors and retailers; (5) food items information such as quantity available,
    quality, expiration date, time spent on the shelf or in the stock (Bermeo-Almeida
    et al., 2018, Kamilaris et al., 2019). The Fig. 12 shows an example of blockchain
    applied to an agri supply chain. Download : Download high-res image (112KB) Download

    extent, secured data storage, remote monitoring, and automation. The blockchain
    address some challenges of IoT such as decentralization, data anonymization, and
    security. Moreover, it allows faster and efficient operations, to improve reliability
    and scalability (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). The analysis of new trends shows
    that: (1) Micro service architecture allows decomposing monoliths in microservices
    lowly coupled which makes it easier to maintain it while allowing other services
    to continue operating. Furthermore, this type of architecture is more resilient
    because if one of the services is down, the other services due to the weak coupling
    can continue to operate at least in a degraded mode. (2) Data Lake/DataHouse propose
    a new approach Load Transform Extract (LTE) where data are firstly stored in their
    original format, which are then transformed in order to extract information. This
    paradigm is particularly well adapted when the amount of data is so important
    that process all data is too costly. In this case, data can be sampled in order
    to obtain information. This paradigm is also well adapted if we want to conserve
    also raw data or complete a generic architecture, for example, to store data that
    will be processed in batch processing. (3) Osmotic Computing attempts to propose
    a solution to the repartition of workload between fog and cloud in decomposing
    treatments in microelements composed of a microservice associated with a micro
    dataset. The osmotic computing could also be associated with the micro service
    architecture to allow the distribution of instances of microservices at different
    levels of the network according to their respective load. (4) Dew Computing aims
    to replicate data near sensors or users to continue to store data or allows to
    continue to consult data when connection is intermittent. It allows improving
    the reliance of architectures on connection interruptions. (5) Blockchain provides
    an answer to authentication and security problems by making it possible in particular
    to verify that the data has not been altered or compromised. Nevertheless, it
    is not possible to store large amount of data such as high definitions images,
    or videos in the blockchain but hashes of datasets allowing to verify their authenticity
    well. 6. Towards Agriculture 5.0 According Myklevy et al., the world must improve
    the amount of food produced by 70% by 2050 to produce global food needs for a
    population (Mykleby et al., 2016) of 9.7 billion according to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Zhang, 2016). To overcome these problems
    and contribute to achieve the second objective of 17 Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) with a timeframe in the range 2015 to 2030,
    the concept of Agriculture 5.0 has been born (Martos et al., 2021). Agriculture
    5.0 aims to increase production sustainably while consuming fewer resources and
    taking care of the environment. This next wave of agricultural revolution will
    imply the use of robots integrating machine learning to compensate for the shortage
    of workers. Farm robots are drastically increasing productivity in improving the
    human labor workforce and can also harvest a more important volume faster than
    a human. Nevertheless, these early technologies are still too expensive for most
    farmers especially small farms (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más, 2020). Fig. 13 show
    the coupling between Agriculture 4.0 and Agriculture 5.0 and their integration
    in the context of the agri-food supply chain, the Society 5.0 and 17 Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations (See Fig. 13). Download : Download

    of the Agriculture 5.0 in the context of the Society 5.0. 7. Conclusion Our review
    is boosted by four research questions dectitaed as follow: (1) Which storage and
    processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address
    its particularities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that
    allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
    valuation possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded
    or autonomous products?. The analysis of the literature shows that a multitude
    of architecture coexists. Nevertheless, the Lambada and Kappa architectures seem
    to emerge as generic architectures. These must generally be accompanied by complementary
    architectural components to address specific needs and be part of a storage and
    processing strategy in which the cloud architecture is a component of the chain
    or may also and more rarely be absent. The traditional centralized cloud computing
    will continue to remain an important part of computing systems (Ai et al., 2018),
    for sciences even if other paradigms appear. Indeed, cloud, fog, and edge computing
    complementary interact with each other to form a mutually beneficial and interdependent
    service continuum. Some functions are naturally more suitable or advantageous
    at a level than another in function of requirements in response time, computing,
    or latency tolerance. However, the cloud cannot be completely replaced by fog
    and edge computing because some computation-intensive tasks can only be processed
    at the cloud level, which has the computing power and storage capacities (Wang
    et al., 2020). In Agriculture 4.0, this is particularly the case for the processing
    of satellite images, the training of artificial intelligence algorithms such as
    Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). New trends make it possible to address
    various problems: (1) The Data lake/Data House offers a more economical alternative
    to massive cloud storage in databases. In this paradigm, all data are stored in
    a state and transform only when they are to be exploited. This approach is particularly
    interesting on one hand when all data are not exploited and on the other hand
    when a decision or an action is not expected immediately. Data lake also allows
    the fusion of agriculture data from various origins in different formats and granularity.
    (2) The blockchain provides solutions in particular to the security problems,
    the possibility of distributing data storage and ensuring the traceability of
    transactions in agrifood supply chains (3) As the literature has shown, Dew Computing
    can be placed in two different places in the network either as close as possible
    to the sensors to allow processing to continue during transmission interruptions
    or as close as possible to users in order to have a local copy of the data in
    order to be able to consult them offline. It should be noted, however, that for
    the second option, there are other means of local caching at the device level,
    for amounts of data of a few mega as those offered by Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
    by example. (4) Osmotic computing provides a solution to the question of how to
    distribute the load between the different processing levels (edge, fog, cloud).
    It uses the concept of microelement associating a microservice and its micro dataset.
    In addition, osmotic computing can also be associated with micro-service architectures.
    (5) The microservice architecture offers the possibility of decoupling the monolithic
    architectures into weakly coupled microservices. These services can be more easily
    associated, maintained, or evolved independently. The combination of these microservices
    makes it easier to develop new services for the end-user that are also easier
    and faster to evolve according to technological developments and needs. In addition,
    at the network level, the 5G network offers new possibilities in terms of Wireless
    Sensors and Actuators Network (WSAN), communication between machines, UAVs, and
    UGVs. Moreover, the coupling with MEC opens the field of processing close of end-users.
    The SDN/NFV Architecture allows to facilitate the design, and to improve the flexibility
    of network. Software-defined networking (SDN) allows decoupling transmission of
    data and network control functionality while Network function virtualization (NFV)
    abstracts transfer network and related network functions (Friha et al., 2021).
    Two trends in the use of processing architecture coexist, on the one hand, users
    of a paid or open source IoT platform, and on the other hand, users who develop
    specific architectures to implement particular use cases. From the point of view
    of transferability, we understand that it is easier for ready-made chargeable
    infrastructures and that it can be limited for turnkey open-source infrastructures
    where the type of license adopted may pose a problem. However, the sustainability
    of paid infrastructure is conditional on the development granted by the company
    that manages them and on its financial health. The development of architecture
    based on paid software bricks is facilitated but its durability is conditioned
    by the availability and the maintenance of these software bricks. As for transferability,
    it is linked to the acquisition of ad hoc licenses. The development of architecture
    using open source software bricks from foundations such as Apache Foundation makes
    it possible not to be limited by licenses but is dependent on developments and
    maintenance carried out by the community of developers. These software bricks
    can be abandoned by the community, the company that sponsors them, or the foundation
    that hosts them. The development of a sustainable architecture would go through
    an emancipation of software bricks which would make it possible to easily change
    them on the one hand when one of them disappears or if a new more efficient software
    brick appears. The deployment of 5G and satellite Internet will bring in a new
    player, which are the telecommunications companies that will be able to provide
    processing capacities and services as close as possible to users at the level
    of 5G antennas, which will impact processing architectures. The problem will then
    arise of interoperability between the networks of sensors and actuators with these
    new high-speed, low-latency networks. The new networks offered by the telecommunications
    companies will make it possible to offer new services or even to decouple the
    software from the hardware, which will make it possible to make the sensors and
    actuators interchangeable. This should make it possible to reduce the cost of
    the equipment and make it accessible to developing countries or areas not covered
    by traditional LPWAN and 3GPP networks. The impact of these new networks will
    have to be reviewed in the future to identify the new trends offered by 5G and
    satellite Internet. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

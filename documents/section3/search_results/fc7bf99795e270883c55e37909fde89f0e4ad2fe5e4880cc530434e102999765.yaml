    1. Introduction Advances in technology and industry have helped humanity to increase
    life quality and expectancy. This includes delegating laborious processes traditionally
    performed by hand to machines that can perform these tasks more efficiently. However,
    it has brought with it several problems as well [1] relating to the overexploitation
    and nonrational use of Earth’s natural resources, which in turn causes disruption
    of the natural balance expressed by climate change effects, such as global warming
    and severe climate events (droughts, flooding, storms, hurricanes, etc.). In response
    to this alarming situation, humanity is asked more than ever to rethink and reconsider
    its way of dealing with the environment, especially in the context of a world
    population that grows at a higher rate [2]. This puts a lot of pressure on our
    food systems to meet the increasing demand and feed the planet. Agriculture is
    the sector that must be addressed, and agricultural management practices need
    to be optimized and become more efficient and sustainable to address these challenges.
    With water resources as an example, agriculture comes in as the largest consumer
    of this resource, with about an average of 70% in use around the world [3]. In
    this sector, water resources are used mainly in irrigation activities that still
    follow unsustainable methods such as gravity irrigation, the most widely used
    type of irrigation globally [4,5]. Additionally, even when using modern methods
    of irrigation, such as drip irrigation, they can be inefficient in the absence
    of good management [6]. The crucial step to achieving an efficient irrigation
    system, whatever the type of irrigation system used, is to know the proper amount
    of water to supply and the time to apply it (when and how much). To this end,
    we need to monitor either the soil, the crop, or the weather. Monitoring the weather
    enables the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), which is the sum of transpiration
    from plants and soil surface evaporation. Accurately estimating this parameter
    allows compensation of the lost water quantity to the atmosphere. There are two
    methods of estimating the evapotranspiration of a crop. One uses a single crop
    coefficient (Kc) that incorporates all physiological and physical variations between
    the crops and the second where the Kc is split into two separate coefficients:
    Kcb for crop transpiration and Ke for soil evaporation. The Kc coefficient, then,
    is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which reflects the rate
    of evapotranspiration for a specific crop (grass). It is obtained by monitoring
    various meteorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, air relative
    humidity, wind speed, etc.). Therefore, weather monitoring is a key step toward
    implementing efficient irrigation systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
    Today, we are able to collect weather data with high spatial and temporal resolution
    thanks to advances in science and technology, including advances in remote sensing
    such as the availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [7] equipped with cutting-edge
    sensors with affordable prices, satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal
    resolutions, open-access reanalysis data such as European ReAnalysis data [8],
    MERRA [9], the JRA-55 [10] or NCEP–DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis data [11]. Additionally,
    advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) field have enabled cost-effective sensor
    data acquisition [12,13,14,15,16]. This huge amount of data raised issues regarding
    the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction
    between these new types of peer-to-peer connected systems that need to be re-examined
    on a large scale, as discussed in [17]. This unprecedented amount of generated
    data is also contributing to what is known as big data, which needs adequate infrastructure
    to be stored and gain insights for assisting agricultural decision making. This
    work aligns with this objective and is intended to provide intelligent ways to
    deal with these abundant data by applying the concepts of big data analytics and
    leveraging the potential applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture
    to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable, which
    represents a step towards the development of smart and precision agriculture.
    2. State of the Art Several researchers have tried to leverage the challenges
    and opportunities of the big data wave in the agricultural field and how it can
    be the driver of sustainability and precision in this sector by gaining insights
    from massive volumes of data that can be used to assist decision making. As surveyed
    in [18], big data analytics is leading to advances in various industries, but
    it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The work presents a range of
    suggested solutions, tools, algorithms, and data, including how they were used
    and their impact upon the sector as a whole. It also emphasizes the enormous potential
    of big data analytics in agriculture for smarter farming, demonstrating how the
    accessibility of big data analytics tools, methods, and software, as well as the
    growing openness of heterogeneous data sources (the “open data wave”), will encourage
    more academic research, public sector initiatives, and business ventures in the
    agricultural sector. The paper concludes that the adoption of big data practices
    in agriculture is still challenging and faces several obstacles when applied to
    real-world applications. In the paper [19], the authors developed a system composed
    of three components: (i) hardware to capture crop data, (ii) a web application
    for crop data and field information manipulation, and (iii) a mobile application
    to control irrigation via mobiles. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    suitability of crops in terms of air temperature, air relative humidity, and soil
    moisture to optimize future plans and strategies. The authors of the work [20]
    propose a solution to be adopted in India to help farmers face the unpredictable
    nature and variability of climate and weather circumstances. They built a system
    for managing local weather stations in real time that would keep farmers well-informed
    about the current weather conditions in advance, allowing them to make the right
    decisions at the right time and prevent crop loss. High-speed internet infrastructure
    available even in rural areas is the main motivation for conducting this work.
    It facilitates the communication of collected data to remote servers. Once received
    and analyzed, the information derived from these data gives farmers a way to automate
    their agricultural management practices (irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting)
    by triggering the right action at the right time. Article [21] also presented
    a smart weather station management system intended to be used in agriculture and
    to manage meteorological stations. It is based on Internet of Things technology
    (IoT) to minimize costs. The connected sensors measure air temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, air pressure, and wind speed. It then sends the collected data
    to the server part of the system through the Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) module. The application layer is powered by the ThingSpeak platform, which
    offers standard services to the proposed system such as data visualization and
    data analysis. In regards to dealing with the challenges related to handling huge
    amounts of data generated by sensors, the paper [22] proposed a standard architecture
    for a data infrastructure platform called WALLeSMART, which is a cloud-based solution
    that provides a general architecture to handle the difficulties of gathering,
    processing, storing, and visualizing extremely large amounts of data in batch
    and real-time modes. An initial prototype has been developed and tested at various
    farms in the Wallonia region of Belgium, showing prominent results. This proposed
    system can be used as the basis for developing customized smart agricultural services
    to meet our needs. Our contributions not only propose an architecture containing
    some of the standard pipelines used in the literature to build data platforms,
    namely data acquisition, storing, visualizing, and analysis, but a complete system
    with the aim of going from data to decision making. The proposed system provides
    services such as weather time series forecasting, missing values handling using
    a multisource approach (reanalysis and situ data), and estimating important parameters
    needed in the day-to-day life of farmers, such as the evapotranspiration (ET).
    3. Study Area The study area is situated 40 km east of Marrakesh in the semiarid
    Haouz plain in the heart of Morocco (Figure 1). About 2800 ha of this area is
    irrigated, and it is nearly flat. Cereal crops such as wheat and barley are the
    main dominant crops. The region’s climate is typically Mediterranean semiarid,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm [23,24], temperatures that range
    from hot in the summer (38 °C in July) to cool in the winter (5 °C in February),
    significant daily and monthly variations that are concentrated primarily from
    autumn to spring, and an average annual ET0 of 1600 mm [25]. Figure 1. R3 district
    study area in Morocco and a Photo of the meteorological station installed. 4.
    System Architecture The proposed system is designed to enable the smart management
    of weather data, which represents the key to implementing smart agriculture. By
    monitoring and analyzing the weather effectively, we can optimize various agricultural
    management practices such as irrigation scheduling and choosing the appropriate
    crop to sow [26]. The design of the platform follows a service-oriented architecture
    (Figure 2) to offer services that address each of the four categories of big data
    analytics. As part of a descriptive data analysis that tries to understand what
    happened in the past, a scenario would be: rainfall declined, and the frequency
    changed over the last decade. The answer to why this happened, in turn, is very
    important, and it takes us to the diagnostic data analysis, where the focus is
    to identify anomalies in data to explain the reasons behind events, such as linking
    this event with long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns observed
    in weather evolution charts. The third type covered by the platform is predictive
    data analysis. It looks beyond the present and tries to predict the future using
    statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that learn from historical
    data in an iterative approach, trying to identify the optimal way to predict the
    future. One such service is weather forecasting. The output of the forecasting
    service can be used to support decision making about what actions to take that
    aim to prevent severe events from occurring in the future. This is carried out
    through the last type, which is prescriptive data analysis. Figure 2. General
    architecture of the platform. The platform can be decomposed into four main layers:
    the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, the processing layer, and
    the application layer. 4.1. Data Acquisition Layer Heterogeneous data from a variety
    of sources, including meteorological station data, IoT weather sensors, reanalysis
    data, third-party meteorological services, and raw files (CSV, Excel, etc.), are
    used as the input for this layer. The concept of big data is introduced to the
    field by the volume, velocity, and variety that characterize these data. Missing
    values are handled in this layer using the method developed in Section 4.4.1 prior
    to being stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database. 4.1.1. Weather Station Data The
    weather dataset used in this study was collected from a meteorological station
    installed in the study area (Figure 1) at the half-hour scale from 2013 to 2020.
    The used tower is equipped with different sensors [27,28] to measure: Incoming
    solar radiation using (Kipp and Zonen CM5 Pyranometer, Delft, The Netherlands).
    Air temperature in Kelvin, relative humidity (R3_Hr, as a fraction between 0 and
    1) and vapor pressure by using (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Wind speed
    using (A100R Anemometer, R.M. Young Company, Traverse City, MI, USA). Rainfall
    using (FSS500 Tipping Bucket Automatic Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). Next, records are stored in data loggers before being collected manually
    by agents or sent to a centralized server via a cellular connection. A full description
    of these data is shown in Table 1, which also includes statistics for missing
    values. Table 1. Meteorological station data description. 4.1.2. ERA5-Land Reanalysis
    Data Advances in measurement technologies have enabled us to use various observation
    methods to monitor the Earth’s weather, including weather stations, weather balloons,
    and satellite imagery, to name a few. However the distribution of these observation
    methods does not cover the entire globe, they may have overlapping footprints
    between covered areas, and fewer of them were available in the past, which makes
    it challenging to conduct studies of past years. To deal with this, climate reanalysis
    emerges as a new way of trying to deliver a complete picture of the past and of
    the entire globe by combining the laws of physics, modern weather models, and
    available weather sources. Such data, if accurate, are crucial and will certainly
    assist decision making in several domains such as smart cities, smart management
    of renewable energy stations, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture [29,30],
    climate change assessments, hydrology [31], and much more. In our study, we used
    the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) [32] available to be downloaded
    for free through the Climate Data Store (CDS) web platform [33]. ERA5-Land is
    the successor to ERA5 [8], which in turn is the successor to ERA-Interim [34].
    This new product covers the period from 1950 to the present. ERA5-Land has the
    benefit over the predecessors of its high horizontal resolution (9 km against
    31 km for ERA5 and 80 km for ERA-Interim). These strengths were achieved thanks
    to the integration of the ECMWF land surface model forced by the ERA5 climate
    reanalysis with corrected elevation for the thermodynamic near-surface state and
    then applied to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The data used in this
    study concern the two pixels that cover our study area (Figure 3). We downloaded
    ERA5-Land weather data from 2013 to 2020. Since the cloud service Climate Data
    Store API (cdsapi) has a limit of 100,000 records per request, we downloaded each
    year separately and combined them all at the end. The downloaded data were then
    converted to a pandas dataframe data structure using the Python language. We also
    developed a function called “get_era5_land_grib_as_dataframe”, available as a
    part of the GIS class of the public library Data Science Toolkit (DST) [35] that
    accepts an ERA5-Land grip file as a parameter and returns a pandas dataframe,
    which is the most commonly used data structure in the data science field. The
    full description of the downloaded parameters is described in Table 2. Figure
    3. The projection of ERA5-Land pixels over the study area. Table 2. ERA5-Land
    downloaded data description. 4.2. Data Storage Layer In our system, most of the
    collected data are time series (meteorological data, reanalysis data, satellite
    data, etc.). This type is characterized mainly by variety (multisource), volume,
    and velocity (each half-hour). To deal with this, the system uses MongoDB, a big-data-driven
    database for storing and retrieving meteorological data. The choice of using the
    MongoDB database comes after several strengths it presents and its suitability
    for our use case, including that it was designed to replace or enhance the classic
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), providing it with a variety of
    additional characteristics such as scalability being schema-less. It is also powerful
    at handling large amounts of real-time data and efficiently handling memory, as
    it is written using the C++ programming language. Not to mention the geospatial
    indexing feature, which makes it perfect for real-time geospatial data collection
    and analysis. Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the weather data
    subcomponent. Figure 4. The Entity Relationship Diagram used in the climate database
    design; ta: air temperature (R3_Tair), rg: global solar radiation (R3_Rg), hr:
    air relative humidity (R3_Hr), p: rainfall (R3_P), ws: wind speed (R3_Vv), wd:
    wind direction (R3_Dv). 4.3. Data Processing Layer The data processing layer takes
    the data from the data storage layer as input and applies the statistical, machine
    learning, and deep learning models to gain insights from the data and turn that
    into services (Figure 2). 4.3.1. Statistical Models Statistical models are used
    in this platform for forecasting purposes. Initially, the model Facebook Prophet
    [36] was used to conduct long-term weather time series forecasting, since it was
    tested on the same data in previous work. 4.3.2. Machine Learning Models The system
    also makes use of machine learning models, given the fact that they can perform
    well on small datasets, for example, the XGBoost [37] model for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation based on stored metrological data [38]. 4.3.3. Deep Learning Models
    Deep learning models or neural networks have gained success in solving complex
    tasks that were previously human-specific and have required some level of human
    intelligence to be solved in different fields. They derive their power by trying
    to mimic the way the human brain works. They are composed of neurons able to process
    huge amounts of data in order to map the output from a set of inputs using internal
    mathematical operations. These neurons are organized into groups called layers
    and, during the propagation of signals between layers in two senses (Forward and
    backpropagation), the deep learning network learns to perform tasks. In our case,
    this is a regression task, where the input is ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the
    output is meteorological station data. 4.4. Application Layer The application
    layer contains multiple services related to weather times series. 4.4.1. Time
    Series Data Imputation Service It is common in real-world meteorological data
    to have missing values for various reasons. Missing values can be due to a network
    error or due to technical issues with certain measurement sensors, etc. These
    missing data can affect the performance of any type of model (machine learning,
    numerical, physical, etc.). As such, they need to be identified and handled efficiently
    during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing stages. There are
    several techniques for dealing with missing data depending on the use case: Deletion:
    Deleting rows or columns with missing values will remove this unwanted type of
    data from our dataset, but it may drastically reduce the size of the dataset,
    especially in the context of data scarcity. Imputation in time series data: In
    the case of a time series with a trend and seasonality, missing data can be replaced
    using seasonal adjustment, such as using the data from the same period of the
    previous year, which is the case for most weather data. However, this method may
    not be as efficient due to changes in weather patterns around the world. In contrast,
    if the time series do not present a trend or a seasonality, it can be treated
    the same way as imputation for a normal dataset. Imputation in normal datasets:
    Replacing it using statistical measures of central tendencies such as the mean,
    median, or mode of a given window of data that require some assumptions about
    the distribution type of the data to be efficient. This service proposes an approach
    based on reanalysis data and artificial intelligence to build models that can
    learn rules to map ERA5-Land reanalysis data to station meteorological data, which
    is also useful for the surrounding regions of our study area (Section 3), since
    we are in relatively homogeneous areas in terms of elevation and climate. We use
    the ERA5-Land data presented in Section 4.1.2 and two different architectures
    of deep learning models. The steps to implement the method workflow are shown
    in Figure 5. Figure 5. The flowchart of the deep learning approach. a. Exploratory
    data analysis Before implementing the proposed machine learning approach, exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) was the first exercise we conducted. It enabled us to understand
    our collected data, as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis and investigation.
    In this step, we made no underlying assumptions about the variables, and we were
    guided only by the observed data. We first calculated the correlation matrix (Figure
    6). This matrix allowed us to choose potential estimators for each target variable.
    Table 3 shows in the second column the potential estimators based on correlation
    coefficients (|r| > 0.5 means high relationships between variables). In the third
    column are the estimators that are used in the literature. Figure 6. The correlation
    heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the station and ERA5-Land parameters. Table
    3. Potential estimators of meteorological parameters. The variable 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 in
    the matrix is calculated using the rule of thumb (Equation (1)), which uses both
    air temperature ( 𝑡2𝑚 ) and dewpoint temperature ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) to estimate air relative
    humidity efficiently for moist air (relative humidity above 50 percent) [39].
    According to the matrix, 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 has a high negative correlation with 𝑡2𝑚 but a
    very weak correlation with 𝑑2𝑚 . Despite this, using the latter ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) combined
    with 𝑡2𝑚 gives a correlation of 0.87 for 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 instead of −0.77, if we take
    only 𝑡2𝑚 into consideration. This motivated us to take both variables as input
    to neural networks for the estimation of 𝑅3 _ 𝐻𝑟 . This is also a confirmation
    for other rule-based (physics-based) approximations that use the same variables
    for air relative humidity estimation derived from the Magnus formula [40] (Equation
    (2)). 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟=100−5(𝑡2𝑚−𝑑2𝑚) (1) 𝑑2𝑚= 𝜆(ln( 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 ))+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 𝛽−(ln(
    𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 )+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 ) (2) Equation (2) is valid for air temperatures ranging
    from −45 to 60 degrees Celsius, the Magnus parameters are, in this case, 𝛽 = 17.62
    and 𝜆 = 243.12 degrees Celsius. For global solar radiation ( 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔 ), the study
    uses the surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd) as estimator. Since the objective
    is to predict meteorological station data based only on ERA5-Land data, we evaluated
    the performance of two deep learning models, namely a Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict 𝑅3_𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 , 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔
    given the ssrd, and 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 and 𝑑2𝑚 . b. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):
    In this type of neural network, the input signals (ERA5-Land data) are fed into
    the input layer composed of 100 neurons. In each neuron, the data are processed,
    taking the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias and then applying an activation
    function (Figure 7), before forwarding the output to the next layer. The activation
    function introduces nonlinearity to the output. The choice of this function has
    a real impact on the training process and performance of models and must be chosen
    according to the problem at hand. For example, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions (Equations (3) and (4)) can be used to capture nonlinearity
    that may exist between inputs and outputs. Figure 7. A single neuron model. For
    our case, and given the fact that moving from ERA5-Land reanalysis data to meteorological
    station data is the inverse of inference in statistics, that is, estimating the
    mean of an individual (station data) given the mean of the population (ERA5-Land
    pixels), the error with this assumption is supposed to be linear (polynomial of
    degree one); that said, we used the Rectified Linear Unit function (ReLU) (Equation
    (5)) as the activation function in our neural network layers, which is true for
    both proposed architectures (FFNN and LSTM). 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥 (3) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=tanh(𝑥)=
    𝑒 𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 + 𝑒 −𝑥 (4) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥)={ 0, x, if𝑥<0 if𝑥≥0 (5) c. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM): The choice behind using this neural network as a comparison is
    due to its ability to deal with data that have long-term dependency, which is
    the case for climate data. LSTM belongs to the Recurrent Neural Networks family
    (RNN), and therefore also has an internal recurrence, that is, during the learning
    process, a signal is fed back to a neuron or layer that has already received and
    processed it (Figure 8), as well as its ability to remember data through gated
    cells, which are a kind of memory that accept values in the interval [0, 1] and
    are used to decide when the flow of a signal passes through the corresponding
    neuron. LSTM was first developed to resolve the limitations of the vanishing [41]
    and exploding gradient problems that may occur during the training phase. This
    problem stops the learning of the neural network because the updates to the various
    weights become very small. Figure 8. Architectures of FFNN and LSTM used in the
    approach. These two architectures (Figure 8) are trained using the Mean Squared
    Error (MSE) as a loss or cost function that enables calculating the error of a
    network at the end of a forward pass. To optimize the network weights, we used
    the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm (Adam), which is characterized
    by fast convergence to the optimal solution and combines the strengths of other
    optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp
    during the training phase. Like most other optimization algorithms, Adam uses
    the partial derivative during backward propagation to calculate the error function
    with respect to each weight within the network (Equation (6)). The Adam algorithm
    then updates the network weights for a minimized loss or cost function using rules
    in Equations (7), (8) and (9), respectively. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑= ∂𝐽 ∂𝜃 (6) 𝑚 𝑡 = 𝛽 1 𝑚 𝑡−1 +(1−

    (9) d. Data normalization Data normalization is performed as part of the data
    preprocessing step and is the process of bringing data to a similar scale. The
    process is also known as feature scaling. In some cases, such as for statistical
    machine learning models, it may not be beneficial, but for deep learning models,
    it is proven to help models to perform better [42,43] in terms of faster convergence,
    reduced training time, and improved stability (preventing models from oscillating
    or divergence). There are multiple methods for data normalization: Min–max standardization:
    Min–max scales the feature values between [0, 1], with 0 being the feature’s minimum
    value and 1 being its maximum value, while maintaining the original distribution
    (Equation (10)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) (10) Decimal scaling: This form
    of scaling is used where values of different decimal ranges are present. For example,
    two features with different bounds can be brought to a similar scale using decimal
    scaling (Equation (11)) 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥 10 𝑛 (11) Such that n is an integer representing
    the order of the scalings. Z-score: This transformation scales the value toward
    a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance using the z-score formula
    (Equation (12)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 (12) such that 𝜇 is the mean and 𝜎 is the standard
    deviation of the features’ distribution. This method is very efficient for datasets
    with a Gaussian distribution. In our case, we applied the min–max method (Equation
    (10)). Next, we initialize the hyperparameters of the two proposed architectures
    (Table 4). These parameters are not updated during the learning phase. Table 4.
    Hyperparameters used during the training of FFNN and LSTM models. e. Dataset splitting
    Before training begins, we split our dataset into three sets: training, validation,
    and test sets. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model
    during each epoch of the training phase. Next, the test set is used to evaluate
    the final trained model. We used 80–20% splitting for the training–test sets,
    respectively, and took 20% of the 80% for the validation set. f. Evaluation Metrics
    To evaluate the trained deep learning models’ performance on the test dataset,
    we employed the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks (Equations (13)–(16)):
    Training time: The time it takes for the model to complete 20 epochs. R2 score
    or R2: The coefficient of determination informs about how well the unknown samples
    will be predicted by our model. It ranges between 0 and 1, but it can be negative
    as well (Equation (13)). R 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 )
    2 (13) The Pearson correlation coefficient (R): It measures the linear relationship
    between two normal distributed variables (Equation (14)). R= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥
    ̲ )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − √ (14) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The average of the squares
    of the errors between real and predicted values by the model (Equation (15)).
    RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 1 𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (15) Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of absolute errors between real and
    predicted values (Equation (16)). MAE= ∑ 𝑛 1 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (16) Given the
    fact that we applied the scaling in our data using the formula in Equation (10),
    all metrics (from Equations (13) to (16)) are unitless. 4.4.2. Forecasting Service
    The forecasting service helps make projections of the future state of the atmosphere
    (air temperature, air relative humidity, global solar radiation, etc.) by performing
    a univariate time series forecasting task. The Facebook Prophet model is used
    according on the performance it has provided when trained and evaluated using
    the same meteorological dataset to perform long-term weather forecasting tasks.
    4.4.3. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation Service One of the most
    important agricultural practices in the day-to-day life of a farmer is irrigation.
    To achieve efficiency, we need to accurately estimate crops’ water needs at each
    phase of crop growth throughout the agricultural season. This can be performed
    through several methods, among others is the estimation of the evapotranspiration
    (ET). It indicates the amount of water loss caused by transpiration from the crop
    and soil surface evaporation. We can obtain the ET of a crop (ETc) by multiplying
    the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient Kc, which holds all
    the physical and physiological differences of a given crop. This service proposes
    to estimate the ET0 using machine learning, namely the XGBoost model constrained
    by the physical model FAO Penman–Monteith. The proposed approach follows the steps
    presented in Figure 9. First, we resampled the air temperature, global solar radiation,
    air relative humidity, and wind speed to the daily average, and precipitation
    to the cumulative daily values, and then the missing values were deleted. Figure
    9. The flowchart of the proposed method. To select the most important contributor
    variables to the ET0 estimate, the method uses a random-forest-based technique
    that ranks the importance of features based on their occurrences in nodes across
    all trees: the bar chart (Figure 10) shows sorted meteorological variables’ importance
    scores. Next, the dataset containing meteorological data and the corresponding
    FAO Penman–Monteith ET0 estimated values are split and fed into the XGBoost model,
    and the model is then evaluated. Figure 10. The features’ importance bar chart
    of meteorological parameters. The objective of this service is to provide an alternative
    to the FAO Penman–Monteith calculation procedure by learning the behavior of this
    procedure using a limited number of climatic variables (Figure 11). It is either
    suitable for stations that lack the necessary hardware and sensors to provide
    the entire set of meteorological data required for FAO Penman–Monteith or in the
    case of technical problems with sensors, among other things. Figure 11. The logic
    of the Evapotranspiration estimation component. 4.4.4. Weather Data Analysis and
    Visualization Service It is well-known that data in their raw form are useless,
    but the information, knowledge, and wisdom derived from them are not. Moving from
    one state of data to another is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),
    which is a subset of the modern data science field and can be performed using
    various methods, such as CRISP-DM [44], which stands for CRoss-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining, or the proposed standard method in [45]. One example
    of insights data visualization and analysis which can be given in our use case
    is shown in Figure 12. This is achieved by following a hybrid methodology that
    includes the following steps: collecting, storing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing,
    and mining. Figure 12. An example of the data analysis scenario. The first three
    steps are common for all other services available on the platform. The added value
    of this service is providing different types of visualization options, including
    comparison plots (line charts of weather time series), relationship plots (scatter
    plot of weather data), and automatically generating correlation heat maps, which
    are important steps in the data analysis phase to study how one variable affects
    another. 4.4.5. Custom Early Warning Alerts Service This service is classified
    as an outlier or anomaly detection problem. These special types of data can be
    detected in time series by using, among others, rule-based methods, in which case
    the service alerts administrators via SMS and email once the given condition is
    satisfied. An example of such a condition is a threshold of temperature or rainfall.
    The second method of sending warnings is to identify sequences that are notably
    different from the rest of the historical time series data. These sequences can
    be the result of measurement error or noise and can inform administrators about
    the status of the different sensors installed in the meteorological station and
    inform them about events that could require urgent action. To perform this, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods that do not require an annotated series
    of anomalies to be trained, in contrast to supervised machine learning algorithms.
    The unsupervised method we used is Local Outlier Factor ( 𝐿𝑂𝐹 ) [46]. It uses
    the KNN algorithm principle to calculate the distance of a point with respect
    to its neighbors. This distance is used, in turn, to obtain the Reachability Density
    ( 𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (17)). 𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐾−𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑗 ),𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑖 ,
    𝑥 𝑗 )) (17) Next is measuring the local deviation of the density of a given point
    using Local Reachability Density ( 𝐿𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (18)), which tells us how far
    the point is from the nearest dense cluster of points. 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥)= 1 ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁
    𝑘 (𝑥) 𝑅𝐷(𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| (18) where 𝑁𝑘(𝑥) is the number of neighbors of
    x whose distance from x is not greater than the k-distance. As a final step, the
    algorithm calculates the 𝐿𝑂𝐹 (Equation (19)). Conventionally the points that have
    a higher anomaly score than their neighbors 𝐿𝑂𝐹 > 1) will be considered as potential
    outliers, but that is not always true, since in anomaly detection there is no
    clear and standard validation approach, and the final decision must relies on
    domain expertise to consider the detected point as an outlier or not, and the
    role of the service ends by notifying the administrators and letting them decide.
    𝐿𝑂 𝐹 𝑘 (𝑥)= ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 𝑘 𝐿𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| × 1 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥) (19) 5. Results
    and Discussions 5.1. Time Series Data Imputation As a result, for handling missing
    data using deep learning, Figure 13 shows the curves for the loss function (MSE)
    and R2 in both training and validation sets during each epoch. For both architectures
    (FFNN and LSTM), the learning curves indicate a good fit of the model represented
    by an initially high training loss that steadily decreases as more training instances
    are added and flattens over time (0.04 for air temperature, 0.098 for global solar
    radiation, and 0.116 for air relative humidity), and the same way for R2, which
    begins with nonoptimal values in training and validation and converges to stable
    change (0.96 for air temperature, 0.84 for global solar radiation, and 0.77 for
    air relative humidity). Table 5 shows the performance comparisons between the
    two deep learning architectures used in the test set. Figure 13. Monitoring of
    MSE and R2 during training and validation phases: air temperature: (a) FFNN, (b)
    LSTM, global solar radiation: (c) FFNN, (d) LSTM, air relative humidity: (e) FFNN,
    (f) LSTM. Table 5. Performance of deep learning models. Table 5 shows the performance
    comparisons between the two deep learning models used in the test set. Once trained,
    the final deep learning model will be ready for deployment in the production environment
    and used to make inferences about meteorological station data given the ERA5-Land
    data. In contrast to Numerical Methods for Weather Prediction (NWP), which take
    considerable time to run [47], predictions based on our model are made instantly.
    5.2. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation We split our dataset into
    five randomly shuffled parts (five folds). We used one fold for model evaluation
    and the remaining four to train it. Finally, we assess the model’s performance
    by calculating the regression metrics across the five folds of the dataset (Root
    Mean Squared Error RMSE and the coefficient of determination R2). According to
    the results of Table 6, the main point is not the perfect results obtained by
    using all parameters as estimators but using only air temperature and global solar
    radiation (average RMSE = 0.27 and average R2 = 0.93), which gave promising results.
    This represents a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0
    by combining two criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using
    limited and simple-to-obtain meteorological variables (air temperature with global
    solar radiation or only air temperature). Table 6. Cross-validation results for
    the three scenarios. According to the results, the proposed method represents
    a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0 by combining two
    criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using limited and simple-to-obtain
    meteorological variables (air temperature with global solar radiation or only
    air temperature). The results obtained are in agreement with the approach followed
    in [48] for the most contributing variables for ET0 estimation, but it outperforms
    it in terms of RMSE (0.19). In addition, the XGboost model used in this study
    outperforms [49] when using all meteorological variables to train a neural network
    (RMSE = 0.19). 5.3. Prototype of the System The platform is named “FLA7A”, which
    means agriculture in Arabic. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the platform’s dashboard.
    By default, it contains the real-time visualization of the last three days of
    hourly weather data (line charts). However, the user can customize the period
    according to their needs. Figure 14. A screenshot of the platform’s real-time
    weather time series visualization service. The black dots represent the original
    measurements, while the black line represents the linear interpolation of the
    dots. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the dashboard that visualizes the last three
    days of hourly weather data. Figure 15 shows the interface of the forecasting
    service. By default, the forecasting period is set to one year. However, the user
    can change this parameter and also customize the number of years it will take
    into consideration when training the model. As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, the
    service initially uses the statistical model Facebook Prophet, which is powerful
    in long-term forecasting. In future work, the platform will integrate more models,
    especially those known for their performance in the task of short-term and mid-term
    weather forecasting, as surveyed in [50]. Figure 15. A screenshot of the platform’s
    forecast service. The light blue is the uncertainty bounds of the uncertainty
    interval around the final predictions (upper and lower), while the dark blue is
    the predicted values, and the black dots represent our original data. This platform
    is the first incremental step towards our goal of creating a decision support
    system intended to implement smart agriculture in Morocco by using artificial
    intelligence and data science to solve real-life problems facing farmers. More
    studies will be performed to add and optimize different parts of this system.
    For example, for data storage, we used MongoDB as a database to deal with real-time
    big data, however, in terms of system scalability or dealing with batch processing
    or long-running ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs, other technologies should
    be considered. A potential candidate for this could be other NoSQL databases [51]
    or the Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, MapReduce, Hive, etc.) [52,53]. Additionally,
    MongoDB has fault tolerance issues, which is true of practically all distributed
    databases. Moreover, in the proposed deep learning method to deal with missing
    data, we do not cover hyperparameter fine-tuning [54], which is one of the biggest
    drawbacks to using deep neural networks. This task can be performed using GridSearch
    [55] or other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms or the Monte
    Carlo method, which can lead to better results. Despite this, we found promising
    results, confirming the reliability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for our study
    area, which could lead to the application of this method using several stations
    in regions with challenging conditions. Finally, for the anomaly detection part,
    we presented an unsupervised machine learning method that is based on how isolated
    a measure is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood to alert administrators
    via SMS and emails, but other efficient methods can be investigated, such as Conformal
    Anomaly Detection (CAP) [56,57]. 6. Conclusions The work conducted in this paper
    makes use of artificial intelligence and big data analytics to develop a platform
    intended for intelligent weather data management, which is essential to implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. The platform exploits huge amounts
    of generated data to gain insights and help assist decision making. The proposed
    platform offers a number of weather-data-related services such as handling missing
    data, visualization, analysis, estimation, and forecasting. Combining ERA5-Land
    reanalysis data and deep learning algorithms to learn the relationship between
    the two data sources gave promising results (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.04) for the
    air temperature variable. The same is true for the estimation of the reference
    evapotranspiration using XGBoost (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07). The platform is
    designed to be service-oriented and will incorporate other services and solutions
    to help farmers and policymakers. Author Contributions Platform and machine learning

    water potentialNon-invasive sensing 1. Introduction Water utilization is becoming
    a critical issue in sustainable viticulture, particularly in the actual context
    of climate change, since periods of strong variability and uncertainty in water
    resources’ availability are forecast (IPCC 2014). As a result, more accurate and
    optimized water management is increasingly aimed, mainly through precise and efficient
    irrigation scheduling, that is determining the optimal time and amount of water
    application to be applied in each plot. Efficient and sustainable water management
    and irrigation in viticulture require objective and representative monitoring
    of the vineyard water status. Towards this end, different approaches are used,
    including soil water measurements, energy and water balance estimates, environmental
    modelling and different plant water stress indicators (Jones, 2004, Mirás-Avalos
    and Silva Araujo, 2021). Vineyard water usage can be appraised by determining
    the total evapotranspiration using atmospheric measurements within the vineyard.
    Estimation of actual vineyard evapotranspiration (ETa) is based on the total energy
    balance, and can be achieved using either the eddy covariance method or the Bowen
    ratio energy balance method (Li et al., 2008). Soil water balances can be also
    used to indirectly estimate the vineyard water status. The principle underlying
    this approach, that is the assessment of the changes in soil moisture over a time
    period, is based on the calculation of the difference between the water inputs,
    namely rainfall and irrigation, and the losses, which account for the vines’ evapotranspiration,
    the runoff and the drainage (Lebon et al., 2003). One of the most critical points
    of the implementation of water balances is the accurate definition of the basal
    crop coefficient (Kbc), when plant-scale is used, and the general crop coefficient
    (Kc) when working at vineyard scale (Rienth and Scholasch, 2019). While lysimeters
    can be used to assess Kc, more recently, vine water balance models have been tested
    and calibrated in combination with remote imagery and atmospheric information
    (Xia et al., 2016). Although this is a promising approach to estimate ETa, calibration
    with plant-based methods is still required. Additionally, the role of inter-row
    cover crops in these balances needs to be better understood, particularly under
    irrigated scenarios (Linares Torres et al., 2018). Plant-based methods have been
    described to be the most adequate methods to estimate plant water status, as the
    plant integrates both soil and environment status (Fernández and Cuevas, 2010).
    Likewise, the usefulness of different physiological parameters and their applicability
    for water stress detection and irrigation management in grapevines has been reviewed
    by different authors (Fernández and Cuevas, 2010, Jones, 2004, Rienth and Scholasch,
    2019). Although very reliable and informative, most of these conventional plant-based
    methods to monitor grapevine water status are destructive as well as time and
    labor consuming (Fernández, 2014). Moreover, many of these tools are capable of
    monitoring a limited number of plants, therefore, they are not appropriate to
    assess the spatial variation of the plant water status within a vineyard (Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2008). Since water and nutrient availability inter and intra-plots may
    be variable (a phenomenon linked to the inherent soil variability within any vineyard
    plot), this variability certainly has a strong influence in grapevine growth,
    physiology, yield and fruit composition (Bramley, 2005, Bramley and Hamilton,
    2004). In this scenario, the usefulness of high-spatial resolution information
    about plant water status zones within-plots has been recommended by several authors
    (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010, Cohen et al., 2017). This would enable to provide
    plants under different water requirements with their appropriate irrigation amounts.
    The ideal method for plant water status assessment should be non-destructive,
    sensitive to water changes, capable of providing a reliable and early response,
    as well as inexpensive, easy to operate and fast to interpret (Fernández, 2014).
    Furthermore, should precision viticulture (Sadler et al., 2005) or variable rate
    irrigation (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015) are aimed, the method to monitor plant
    water status has to be as highly automated as possible, in order to provide a
    large number of data to assess within-vineyard variability. Thermography has long
    been recognized as a very sensitive, non-destructive technology capable of monitoring
    canopy temperature as a surrogate of the plant water status. While leaves are
    transpiring, water is released through the stomata causing a reduction of leaf
    temperature. However, if transpiration stops, leaf temperature increases, as heat
    dissipation in the leaf does not longer occur (Jones et al., 2002). Following
    this rationale, thermal cameras of a wide range of resolution (Carrasco-Benavides
    et al., 2020), even smartphone-based (Petrie et al., 2019) have been used as portable
    devices to estimate plant water status (in order to steer irrigation decision-making),
    but the process is manual, therefore, time and labor demanding, and enables only
    a limited number of plant measurements. The latter has been partially overcome
    by aerial thermal imaging, which successfully extends to large field extensions
    (Baluja et al., 2012). However, in some crops, such as grapevines, the aerial
    observation comes with a reduced spatial resolution in the measurements that shrinks
    several meters of the canopy into a few numbers of pixels, losing a definite amount
    of information. Likewise, in many winegrape vineyards, which are planted following
    a vertical trellising (typically vertical positioning system, VSP) the number
    of vegetation pixels associated to grapevines is much smaller from a zenithal
    perspective (since VSP canopy widths range between 30 and 45 cm) than from a lateral
    view (in which canopy walls are a continuous of 1–1.5 m height). Moreover, it
    is often the case that pixels are mixed of canopy and soil information, which
    need to be separated. This brings the opportunity for developing thermal systems
    for the grapevine water status estimation capable of gathering detailed canopy
    information from a close lateral point of view (Costa et al., 2019) and to cover
    large areas for the monitoring of the vineyard water status variability using
    on-the-go approaches (Gutiérrez et al., 2018). Ground lateral thermography of
    grapevines has been successfully tested using thermal cameras (Gutiérrez et al.,
    2018) and good relationships between the predicted vs observed stem water potential
    (Ψs), which was used as the plant’s water status indicator, from canopy temperature
    measurements were obtained. Although this was a relevant achievement towards on-the-go
    thermography, the processing of thermal images after monitoring, to extract the
    canopy information is not simple (Liu et al., 2020), and requires time and specific
    knowledge. In an thorough review covering the use of ground-based thermography
    to assess plant water status in agriculture, the advantages of infrared radiometers
    vs thermal cameras were summarized (Maes and Steppe, 2012). Infrared radiometers
    measure the infrared radiation in the range between 8 and 14 µm. These sensors
    can be seen as a simplified version of thermal cameras. Depending on the design
    of the radiometer, its field of view and the distance to the target, the measuring
    spot size may change. The radiometer provides an averaged value of the target’s
    surface temperature of the measuring spot. While thermography yields measurements
    of the temperature of the grapevine canopy, the interpretation of thermal data
    is not simple, as leaves in the measuring spot of the targeted canopy may undergo
    different environmental conditions and leaf orientations, both factors potentially
    affecting the thermal measurement (Poirier-Pocovi and Bailey, 2020). Moreover,
    if canopy temperature is aimed to be used as a water status indicator, it has
    to be normalized to account for the environmental conditions (Conesa et al., 2019).
    Given this, the use of ancillary information, both environmental (e.g. air temperature,
    relative humidity) and/or retrieved from other non-invasive sensors also measuring
    the canopy from a moving vehicle may help to complement and improve the assessment
    of the plant water status. One of these non-destructive technologies is multispectral
    imaging (MSI). MSI measures the interaction between the electromagnetic radiation
    with the vegetation in a small (typically four or six) number of narrow wavelengths
    (e.g. red, green, blue [RGB] and near infrared [NIR]). Wavelengths may be separated
    by filters or by the use of instruments that are sensitive to specific wavelengths.
    MSI information is generally processed to derive one or more spectral indices.
    These are mathematical combinations or transformations of the recorded spectral
    bands that accentuate the spectral properties of green plants and their constituents
    so that they appear distinct from other features. In agriculture, spectral indices
    are generally related to photosynthetically active biomass which, in turn, can
    be related to the size and/or health of the vegetation. Of these spectral indices,
    the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely used in viticulture
    but many others have been developed (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2007). The inclusion
    of vegetative spectral indices in the prediction models of grapevine water status
    may provide real-time feedback on grapevine water use as influenced by actual
    grapevine vegetative growth and abiotic and/or biotic stress patterns (Baluja
    et al., 2012). Furthermore, NDVI is linearly related to canopy growth (Trout et
    al., 2008), and this has been shown to be a key factor determining grapevine water
    use (Williams and Ayars, 2005). Therefore, the goal of this work was to develop
    a methodology, based on the combined use of environmental and multispectral data,
    acquired from a moving vehicle, contemporarily to thermal canopy measurements
    using a simple infrared radiometer, as a potential approach to provide an improved
    estimation of the vineyard water status. The underlying hypothesis is that this
    combination of data, acquired with different technologies, may outperform the
    capability of a single technology to determine physiological parameters of the
    vineyard, such as water status. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Vineyard site and
    irrigation treatments The study was conducted in a commercial vineyard (3.1 ha)
    located in the Rioja wine region (Spain) during seasons 2019 and 2020. The vineyard
    was located in Tudelilla (Spain) (Lat. 42°18′ 18.26″, Long. −2°7′ 14.15″, 515
    m asl). Grapevines of Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) were planted in 2002, (north-south
    orientation) with vine spacing of 2.60 m between rows and 1.20 m between vines,
    and trained to a vertically shoot-positioned trellis system on a double-cordon
    Royat. In order to induce a wide variability of grapevine water status, different
    water regimes were deployed. The irrigation management was based on stem water
    potential (ψs) measurements: T0: Full irrigation. Two water pipelines irrigating
    (6 L h−1) were installed, applying two hours per day, five days a week. T1: Moderate
    irrigation. A single water pipeline irrigating half the amount in T0 was installed,
    and T2: No irrigation. The three different water treatments were applied as a
    randomized complete block design, as previously described elsewhere (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2018). For each treatment, three blocks were set up, making up a total
    of nine treatment replicates in three different vine rows. Each treatment replicate
    comprised 25 plants but only the 15 middle ones were considered for measurement.
    Likewise, the first and last five vines per replication were disregarded to avoid
    any edge effect. The “measuring unit” consisted of five consecutive vines, therefore,
    three measuring units were established within each replicate. 2.2. Sensors and
    mobile sensing platform On-the-go thermal measurements in the vineyards were carried
    out using an infrared radiometer that was deployed in the mobile platform to estimate
    the grapevine water status. We define “on the go” as the method of data acquisition
    which stores the data (and present results if needed when the final model is elaborated),
    in real time while the ground mobile platform is moving along the rows. The “on-the-go”
    approach is opposed to “stop-and-go” operations, in which the ground vehicle stops
    to take each measurement. Infrared radiometer SI-421 (Apogee instrument Inc.,
    Utah, USA) was used to measure the surface canopy temperature (Fig. 1). The original
    data acquisition rate of 0.7 Hz (configured by the manufacturer) was increased
    to 1.8 Hz by carefully reducing the wait times, which are necessary in the communication
    with the sensor, to the minimum values that still provided reliable functioning.
    This upgrade doubled the number of canopy temperature measurements per plant.

    Fig. 1. Infrared radiometer sensor SI-421 and optical geometry scheme. In order
    to have a better description of the microclimate of the grapevines, low-cost sensors
    of air temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure were also installed
    in the mobile platform to measure these three variables contemporarily to the
    grapevine canopy temperature. A unit of BME280 (Bosch Sensortec, Germany) providing
    three environmental sensors was hence installed for the measurement of the air
    temperature (Tair,°C), relative humidity (RH %) and the atmospheric pressure (AP,
    mb). This sensor was attached to an Arduino nano board to provide communication
    with the rest of the equipment (internal computer) and assembled on the mobile
    platform. The response time of these environmental sensors was 3.6 Hz. Additionally,
    for the dates and time intervals at which measurements were taken, the vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD) was calculated. Following the multiple-data approach investigated
    in this work, multispectral imagery was also acquired on-the-go from the ground
    mobile platform and lateral point of view simultaneously to thermal measurements
    (Fig. 2b). To that end, the OCI™ – M Multispectral Camera (BaySpec Inc., San Jose,
    USA) was used. This multispectral camera measures at eight spectral bands (470 nm,
    560 nm, 670 nm, 720 nm, 780 nm, 840 nm, 900 nm and 970 nm) covering from visible
    (VIS) to short-wave near infrared (SW-NIR) region. The camera features high data
    transfer rates (up to 120 fps). From the acquired multispectral imagery the Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1974) and the Green Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) (Ecarnot et al., 2013) were computed. Also,
    as shown in Table S1 (see supplementary material) the calculated reflectance values
    of the two spectral bands related with the Chlorophyll (Band 560 nm) and water
    stress (Band 840 nm) (González-Fernández et al., 2015, Peñuelas et al., 1997)
    were also separately recorded. The NDVI is one of the most commonly used vegetation
    spectral indices. It is a ratio between the near infrared (NIR) and red channels
    and relates to the plant vigour, vegetative growth and nutritional status (Bourgeon
    et al., 2016). The GNDVI index is another vegetative spectral index related with
    the leaf properties such as the chlorophyll content. For the GNDVI, differently
    to the NDVI the green band (560 nm) is used in the ratio instead of the red band
    (670 nm). Download : Download high-res image (479KB) Download : Download full-size

    set up to monitor the grapevine water status. (b) Detail of the infrared radiometer,
    multispectral camera and environmental sensors used for on-the-go measurement
    of the vineyard water status. All these sensors were assembled in a mobile platform
    in the two seasons. This mobile platform was a modified brushcutter (940 Sherpa
    4WD XL, AS-motor, Bühlertann, Germany) capable of keeping the selected constant
    driving speed at 3 Km h −1. The infrared radiometer, the multispectral camera
    and environmental sensors were connected to an industrial computer which communicated
    via WIFI with a tablet (Sony Xperia Z2 SGP511). 2.3. On-the-go data acquisition
    Data acquisition using the mobile platform was carried out at solar noon (between
    14:00 and 15:00 h, local time) across five different dates (July 9th,19th, 22nd
    and 25th, and August 22nd) during 2019 season, and three dates (July 3rd, 17th
    and August 6th) in season 2020. The infrared radiometer, the environmental sensors
    and the multispectral camera were assembled in the mobile platform (Fig. 2). The
    multispectral camera and the infrared radiometer were mounted in the front part
    of the platform, at a height from the floor of 1 m, and at an approximate canopy
    distance of 0.5 m aiming at the central section of the canopy, to avoid the influence
    of the sky and soil (Fig. 2b). With this target distance and the field of views
    (FOVs) of the camera and the infrared radiometer sensor, the multispectral imaging
    covered scenes of approximately 0.35 m horizontally and 0.20 m vertically, while
    the measuring window (circle) of the infrared radiometer had a diameter of 0.33 m.
    Multispectral images and infrared radiometry were collected on the east side of
    the canopy, while the mobile platform was driven at an average speed of 3 Km h−1.
    Retrieved measurements were georeferenced using a GPS receiver Ag Leader 6500
    (Ag Leader Technology, Inc., Ames, IA, USA) with RTK correction installed on the
    mobile platform (Fig. 2a). The environmental sensors were installed close to the
    infrared radiometer, under an aluminium plate to protect them against dust and
    solar radiation as it can be seen in Fig. 2b. These sensors provide an average
    value of the surface temperature of the target (in this case the grapevine canopy)
    at a given time frequency. In this work we used one of these infrared thermal
    sensors to monitor the grapevine canopy temperature on-the-go, and an average
    canopy temperature value was recorded (almost two measurements per second) and
    sent to the internal computer assembled in the moving vehicle. In order to avoid
    the use of reference temperatures but with the aim of including the environmental
    information to “correct” canopy temperature, sensors recording the air temperature,
    relative humidity and atmospheric pressure sensors were installed close to the
    infrared radiometer and their information, which was captured simultaneously to
    the canopy temperature. Also, with the aim of providing the prediction model with
    data about the vegetative status of the canopy and its variability (to account
    for differences in canopy architecture and vegetative status) spectral information
    was gathered on-the-go, simultaneously to the canopy temperature and environmental
    data with a multispectral camera (OCITM-M). Since the OCITM–M Multispectral Camera
    is mostly aimed at UAV usage, we developed our own control software tailored for
    the use on a ground moving vehicle. As this camera is a push broom model, a mosaic
    was built (Fig. S1, supplementary material) by continuously taking images while
    the ground vehicle moved, using a variable delay depending on the speed (since
    distance to the canopy was kept as constant as possible in all the measurements).
    Also, the exposure control of the camera had to be reimplemented to achieve a
    good signal to noise ratio in the spectral bands of interest. This would also
    avoid the need to take frequent images of a white reference when the light conditions
    varied in the field. A total of five white reference values were stored in our
    software. According to the average values of all the bands at given integration
    times the correct white reference is selected for each measurement. The black
    value was constant under all conditions, so the same stored value was used. All
    these corrections are performed automatically in real time with our software.
    The control software of the camera was implemented in the C+ + programming language,
    looking for efficiency and reusability, using the Application Programming Interface
    developed by XIMEA (Münster, Germany), which is the manufacturer of some of the
    core components of the OCITM–M Multispectral Camera. To complement that, also
    a library for image processing was used, choosing OpenCV (Itseez, 2015. Open Source
    Computer Vision Library) as it is the “de facto” standard for computer vision
    and image processing on C+ +, and provides the high efficiency we required for
    this usage. Grapevines’ canopy temperature (Tc) values recorded with the infrared
    radiometer, as well as data acquired with the environmental sensors (Tair, RH,
    and AP) were automatically saved in the industrial computer of the mobile platform.
    Regarding the multispectral images, these were also recorded in the internal computer
    of the moving platform, but further processing was necessary after monitoring
    completion to compute the different spectral vegetative indices of interest. The
    same algorithm (OpenCV, (Itseez, 2015. Open Source Computer Vision Library)) was
    used to obtain the vegetative indices and spectral bands’ information. 2.4. Stem
    water potential (ψs) as reference indicator of grapevine water status Midday stem
    water potential (ψs) was used as reference indicator of the plant water status,
    and it was simultaneously measured to the on-the-go measurements. A Schölander
    pressure bomb (Model 600, PMS Instruments Co., Albany, USA) was used to assess
    the stem water potential (ψs) near solar noon between 14:00 and 15:00 local time.
    For each replicate, from each group of five plants (measuring unit), a random
    one was marked and one leaf from the mid-upper part of the canopy was measured
    for the stem water potential after one hour of dark adaptation of the leaves in
    aluminium foil bags. Therefore, 27 leaves were measured each day, making a total
    of 135 ψs measurements in season 2019 and 81 measurements in season 2020. 2.5.
    Data analysis and modelling As mentioned earlier, the measurement unit was a group
    of five consecutive vines within the same replication. Likewise, a unique averaged
    value of Tc, environmental variables and spectral vegetative indices was assigned
    to each measuring unit. Identification of each measuring unit was accomplished
    with the georeferenced positioning recorded by the GPS mounted in the mobile vehicle.
    Calibration and prediction models for grapevine water status assessment were built
    using the PLS Toolbox (version 8.1, Eigenvector Research, Inc., Manson, WA, USA)
    software in conjunction with MATLAB (version 2019a, The Mathworks Inc., Natick,
    MA, USA). Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used as the algorithm for
    training the plant water status prediction models utilizing average water potential
    reference values (Y matrix) and all the sensors’ variables and vegetative indices
    (X matrix) retrieved from the moving vehicle from each measuring unit as inputs.
    A K-fold cross-validation was conducted to choose the optimal number of latent
    variables (LV) as well as to obtain an estimation of the error rate of the models.
    To evaluate the quality of the models the determination coefficient of calibration
    (R2c) and cross-validation (R2cv), the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC)
    and cross-validation (RMSECV) were calculated. In order to develop classification
    models, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to evaluate the capability
    of the set of thermal, environmental and spectral data used for the regression
    models to distinguish among different plant water status. Matlab R2020b was used
    for data processing using LDA as the classification method. In order to prevent
    overfitting and evaluate the prediction capability of the models, 10-fold cross
    validation was used on each one of the datasets. An Optimizable Discriminant Linear
    Method was trained using Bayesian optimization. The training process was automatically
    performed and finished when the model stopped improving, as indicated by Expected
    improvement per second plus acquisition function (Bull, 2011). This is the default
    acquisition function for this kind of models, with the “Plus” part referring to
    a modification of the behavior of the acquisition function in order to avoid overexploiting
    a certain area. Towards this end, the measured values of ψs were assigned to three
    nominal classes of water status, low water stress (L: ψψs ≥ −0.8. MPa), medium
    water stress (M: −1.4 ≤ ψs ≤ −0.8) and high water stress (H: ψs ≤ −1.4 MPa). These
    were established as in Fernández-Novales et al. (2018). Classification matrices
    were built for each individual season and the combination of both and precision
    of the classification models was assessed using the percentage of correctly classified
    samples, for each water status class and the global model. 3. Results 3.1. Stem
    water potential and on-the-go acquired data Table 1 summarizes the averaged values
    for all environmental and multispectral data, gathered by the sensors and camera
    located in the mobile platform plus the calculated vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
    and the measured Ψs during the measuring time windows for each date in the two
    seasons. Regarding the environmental variables, the average air temperature at
    the time of measurement (between 14:00–15:00 hrs, local time) was above 30ºC in
    four of the five dates in 2019, even reaching 37ºC the 25th July 2019, and two
    dates in 2020. The first day of measurement in both seasons was a cool day, particularly
    in 2019, when average air temperature during measurements was below 20ºC (Table
    1). Accordingly, the RH was kept around, or below 20% in the last four dates in
    2019, and ranged between 24% and 28% in 2020. The combination of high temperature
    and low RH was reflected in the VPD values, which, with the exception of the 9th
    July 2019 (VPD=0.73kPa) and the 3rd July 2020 (VPD=2.32 kPa), all of them surpassed
    the 3kPa (Table 1). Interestingly, the largest coefficient of variation values
    for Tair and VPD were recorded at the first measuring day in the two seasons (Table
    1). The day with the highest evaporative demand in 2019 was the 25th July (VPD
    higher than 5 kPa) and the 6th August 2020 (VPD higher than 4 kPa). Speaking of
    Tc and Ψs, while Ψs became smaller as season progressed in both years, showing
    overall increased plant water stress, Tc raised along the Summer (except for the
    22nd August 2019), following the variation of Tair. The difference between these
    two temperatures (Tair-Tc) ranged from 0.6 ºC to 5.5 ºC across the two seasons,
    showing the largest values the 19th July 2019 (4.9ºC) and the 17th July 2020 (5.5
    ºC), being the average 3.3ºC. In terms of the variability of Ψs at each measuring
    date, expressed as the coefficient of variation, this reached a 77% the 9th July
    2019, which was a cool and cloudy (average global radiation at the time of measuring
    was 721.6 W/m2, as recorded by a local weather station of the Rioja Government)
    Summer day, with high RH and very low (though variable) VPD (Table 1). Table 1.

    0.79 (13.2) 0.90 (20.5) 0.69 (13.4) Four multispectral variables (two indices
    and two reflectance bands) were obtained from the information retrieved by the
    multispectral camera in the moving vehicle. Likewise, the R840 nm, which is linked
    to the plant water stress (González-Fernández et al., 2015), exhibited the highest
    fluctuations across dates in both seasons, while subtle changes in the averaged
    values of NDVI, GNDVI and R560 were monitored. At each particular date, the coefficient
    of variation ranged from 5.2% to 13.3% for the NDVI, between 17.8 and 28.5 for
    the GNDVI, from 22% to 35% for R560 and between 13% and 26% for R840. 3.2. Predictive
    regression models for vineyard waters status The linear regression between the
    average canopy temperature (Tc) and the stem water potential (Ψs) for each measuring
    unit yielded a coefficient of determination (R2) lower than 0.10 in season 2019,
    and substantially higher (R2 =0.510) in season 2020, although in the latter, two
    big point clouds, rather than a good distribution of the data along the regression
    line was drawn (plot not shown). In terms of the standard error of estimation
    (SEE) values, these ranged from 0.15 to 0.33 MPa in both vineyards (Table S2).
    As the performance indicators of the direct regressions between the plant’s temperature,
    as well as spectral indices and plant’s water potential were low (see Table S2),
    and since additional measurements of environmental and grapevine vigour features
    had been contemporarily recorded, a multivariate regression approach was attempted.
    In Table 2, the performance metrics (R2 and RMSE) for both calibration and cross-validation
    models built to estimate the Ψs using the different sets of environmental and
    spectral data in addition to the Tc for the two individual seasons and the two-seasons’
    dataset are shown. Autoscaling (Wise, B.M.; Gallagher, N.B.; Bro, R.; Shaver,
    J.M.; Winding, W.; Scott Koch, 2006) was the only type of pretreatment applied
    to the data. The highest number of latent variables used to build the models was
    six (season 2019), and ten-fold cross validation was applied. As observed, when
    Patm was included in the model its performance, both in terms of R2 and RMSE improved
    substantially. This can be observed for the two individual seasons and their combined
    set from the comparison between models with only 3 variables (model A) and those
    adding Patm to Tc, Tair and RH (model B) (Table 2). On the other hand, the inclusion
    of NDVI to the 3-variable models (model A) was less influential in improving model
    performance, with almost no changes between models C vs A in season 2019, and
    slight improvement in season 2020 and the two years’ dataset. Similarly, no substantial
    upgrade of the performance metrics was observed when spectral information (R560,
    R840 or NDVI) was introduced to model B, although subtle increase in R2 and RMSE
    can be seen for model D, in which R560 (corresponding to the green band) was used.
    The inclusion of VPD in the models led to increased performance in both R2 and
    RMSE (model G vs model F) in season 2019 and the two-years’ set and less influential
    in season 2020. In fact, model G (which includes VPD) was found to be the best
    model in season 2019. Table 2. Summary of the calibration and cross validation

    improvements in both R2 and RMSE values were detected particularly in season 2020
    and the two-years’ dataset when GNDVI was included (see models H and J to M).
    From the results shown in Table 2 it can be said that a 6-variable model, which
    includes Tc, Tair, RH, Patm and some spectral information already provides a good
    estimation of the stem water potential, with R2cv between 0.604 and 0.669, and
    RMSECV between 0.1241 and 0.2065 (Table 2). Should a simpler multispectral sensor
    be used (of lower cost and size), such as commercial NDVI sensors, then models
    G or F (with and without VPD, respectively) could be built, yielding R2cv ranging
    from 0.569 to 0.644. Generally speaking, the values of RMSECV for all models built
    with data gathered in season 2019 were higher than those in 2020 as the range
    of the averaged values of stem water potential in 2019 (−0.43 to −1.79 MPa) was
    also higher than in 2020 (−0.94 to −1.37 MPa) (Table 1). The best partial least
    squares (PLS) regression models for the estimation of the plant water status in
    each individual season and when both years were jointly considered are six-variable
    models. These are shown in italics and bold font in Table 2 and depicted in Fig.
    3. All the samples from the ψs regression models displayed a good fit along the
    regression lines and were mostly inside the 95% confidence bands (Fig. 3). A wide
    range of grapevine water status (in terms of ψs) was covered, with values ranging
    from − 0.4 MPa to − 2.1 MPa in 2019 and from − 0.7 to − 1.5 MPa in 2020. These
    values reflect that grapevines under no-water stress (ψs ≥ −0.8 MPa), undergoing
    low to medium water stress (−0.8 MPa > ψs > −1.4 MPa), or suffering from severe
    water stress (ψψs ≤ −1.4 MPa) (Leeuwen et al., 2009) were monitored in both seasons.

    waters status LDA was used to evaluate the capability of the set of six thermal,
    environmental and spectral variables that yielded the best regression models for
    each season and the two years (Table 2) to distinguish among three different vine
    water status (low, medium and high). Prior to run the LDA the homogeneity of the
    covariance matrices was tested (p = 0.08), and the suitability of this method
    for this dataset was confirmed. The confusion matrices for the classification
    models built using the variables included in the best predictive regression models
    (Table 2) are presented in Fig. 4. The percentage of total corrected classified
    values was equal or above to 74% (season 2019: 74.8%, season 2020: 77.8% and seasons
    2019&2020: 73.9%) (Fig. 4). For the M class, which was the most numerous plant
    water status class in both seasons, the percentage of correctly classified samples
    was always above 75%, reaching 85.2% in season 2020 (Fig. 4b). On the other hand,
    class L, which accounted for the lowest number of instances in all seasons, showed
    more discrete percentages of correct classification samples, ranging from 50%
    in season 2020 (Figs. 4b) to 66.7% in 2019 (Fig. 4a). Download : Download high-res

    4. Discussion This study presents a novel methodology to assess the variability
    of grapevine water status in a commercial vineyard from the combination of thermal
    data, gathered with a low-cost, non-destructive, infrared radiometer, with environmental
    and multispectral data, acquired on-the-go from a ground moving vehicle. Most
    of the works conducted on thermography applied to plant water status assessment
    in viticulture and other crops have used thermal cameras of lower (Petrie et al.,
    2019) or higher resolution (Costa et al., 2019), portable thermal devices (García-Tejero
    et al., 2016) or cameras mounted on ground platforms (Gutiérrez et al., 2018).
    In fact, thermography solutions (some of them commercial) to assess vineyard water
    status based on aerial platforms either from drones (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2020,
    Sepúlveda-Reyes et al., 2016) or manned aircrafts (Bellvert et al., 2016, Pagay
    and Kidman, 2019) can be found. In recent times, several thermal satellites startups
    with agricultural focus are emerging (ie. Albedo (Texas, USA), Hydrosat (Washington
    DC, USA) that may also provide satellite-based thermography for viticultural monitoring
    in a short time. However, aerial thermography of grapevines (which is not a continuous
    crop, but usually grown on discrete rows in which vegetation does not expand more
    than 45 −50 cm wide) has to face some disadvantages compared to ground monitoring.
    In first place, the architecture of the crop makes that the number of vegetation
    pixels that can be monitored from a zenithal view is usually smaller than from
    lateral view. Additionally, aerial thermography focuses on the most apical leaves,
    which are those exhibiting highest photosynthesis rates and which are experiencing
    a different microclimate than mid to low (closer to the fruiting zone) leaves
    of the shoots (Grant et al., 2016). Thermography form manned aircrafts are usually
    expensive and less flexible, but it can be very suitable to assess the vineyard
    water status of a region or large vineyards. On the other hand, thermal monitoring
    from drones or UAVs are easy to book (commercial companies provide them at reasonable
    prices of 35–50 €/ha) but limitations due to drone regulations in certain areas
    and the duration of the batteries may be disadvantageous. On the other hand, as
    pointed out by Maes and Steppe (Maes and Steppe, 2012), image processing is a
    time-consuming step that requires expert knowledge in both software and thermography.
    Crop canopy temperature measured with infrared radiometers has been successfully
    used to monitor plant water stress (Falkenberg et al., 2007, Sadler et al., 2002)
    and, using specific algorithms, to control irrigation scheduling as well (O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010, Peters and Evett, 2008). The present work is one of the few attempts
    (Fernández-Novales et al., 2021, McClymont et al., 2012) to use this type of infrared
    radiometers, built for outdoors measurement (therefore ruggedized and robust enough
    to resist all kind of environmental conditions), on-the-go, rather than statically
    from a pole or post (Jones et al., 2018) or under limited movement, in a stop-and-go
    moving pivot (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010, Peters and Evett, 2008). The automated
    measurement of canopy temperature at real time without the need of image processing
    (Liu et al., 2020) enabled the easy monitoring of grapevine canopy temperature
    along the vineyard without much effort. However, the relationship between the
    recorded canopy temperature and the plant water status, expressed as ψs, was not
    completely straightforward, as shown by the inconsistent determination coefficients
    obtained in both seasons. Although extensive literature reports successful correlations
    between leaf temperature and plant water status, particularly with stomatal conductance
    (Jones, 1999b, Jones et al., 2002, Leinonen et al., 2006, Grant et al., 2007,
    Pou et al., 2014), weak relationships between canopy temperature and ψs were found
    in almond trees (García-Tejero et al., 2018) and cherry trees (Carrasco-Benavides
    et al., 2020) while other authors have reported better performance in grapevines
    (Costa et al., 2019). One reason explaining the poor relationship between canopy
    temperature and ψs is that leaf temperature is well known to be linearly related
    to evapotranspiration, but substantially influenced by the microclimatic conditions
    and their changes (eg. air temperature, wind speed, radiation) (Maes and Steppe,
    2012, Poirier-Pocovi and Bailey, 2020). For this reason, leaf or canopy temperature
    are usually normalized (mathematically) for most applications. Likewise, reference
    values of Tdry and Twet, to compute thermal indices, such as the Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI) (Idso et al., 1981) and the Conductance Index (Jones, 1999) are frequently
    used. Notwithstanding, the use of reference temperatures is not practical for
    on-the-go applications, as ideally, both Tdry and Twet values should be recorded
    contemporarily to canopy temperature. Although several approaches to define these
    reference temperatures and combinations to increase the sensitivity of these thermal
    indices to water stress, and reducing their sensitivity to the fluctuating environmental
    conditions have been attempted (Cohen et al., 2017, García-Tejero et al., 2016,
    Poirier-Pocovi et al., 2020), the use of reference temperatures still remains
    as a pitfall towards the automated use of thermography, as recently stated by
    Gutiérrez et al. (2018). These authors reported similar performance values (R2
    =0.65; RMSE=0.184 MPa) for the estimation of the plant water status using machine
    learning algorithms with and without reference temperatures. A total of 13 different
    multivariate regression models, involving the canopy temperature and additional
    environmental and spectral variables were built for each season and the two years
    altogether. Likewise, regression models of three to nine variables (both calibration
    and cross-validation) were built and the R2 and RMSE values helped to compare
    their performance in estimating the ψs measured with the pressure chamber. The
    inclusion of the three environmental variables (Tair, RH and Patm) to the Tc,
    all of them measured on-the-go from the moving platform already shown adequate
    estimation capabilities with R2cv above 0.50 in all cases. The inclusion of the
    spectral information, regardless the spectral index or variable to be included
    (ie. NDVI, R560, R840) generally contributed to improve the estimation performance,
    both in terms of R2 and RMSE. Likewise, the best regression model for each year
    and the combination of both seasons was not always exactly the same one, but in
    all cases, it was a six-variable model, which included Tc, Tair, RH, Patm and
    some spectral information, thus supporting the initial hypothesis of this study,
    which advocated for the combination of thermal, environmental and spectral information
    to estimate grapevine water status. Should a simplified model (of only five variables,
    Tc, Tair, RH, Patm plus a spectral variable) is aimed, R2cv would be above 0.55
    for all three datasets and RMSECV would slightly increase, ranging from 0.13 to
    0.21 MPa. The relevance of environmental variables in the prediction model of
    plant water status has also been reported in grapevines (Suter et al., 2019) and
    peach trees (Abrisqueta et al., 2015). Likewise, Petrie et al. (2019) found that
    PLS regression models to estimate stomatal conductance and Ψs from canopy thermal
    information and several environmental variables (air temperature, RH, solar radiation
    and wind speed) were weak, but most of the weather parameters made statistically
    significant contribution to the models, with special attention to wind speed,
    which was found to be a very strong contributor. Canopy temperature has long been
    recognized to change dramatically with wind (Maes and Steppe, 2012), therefore
    the inclusion of a wind speed sensor in future trials should be encouraged as
    a potentially influential environmental variable, that could lead to improved
    estimation of the Ψs using this multivariate approach based on on-the-go thermography.
    Vegetative spectral indices, such as NDVI, have been used to estimate crop coefficients
    in several crops (Bausch and Neale, 1987) and their potential as near real-time
    surrogates for crop coefficients of evapotranspiration was proposed by Jackson
    et al. (1980). Moreover, other authors have reported differences in plant water
    status between vineyard zones using NDVI (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008) as well
    as the usefulness of this spectral vegetation index to define irrigation management
    zones (Taylor et al., 2010). The inclusion of vegetative spectral indices in the
    prediction models of grapevine water status may provide real-time feedback on
    grapevine water use as influenced by actual grapevine vegetative growth and abiotic
    and/or biotic stress patterns. Furthermore, NDVI is linearly related to canopy
    growth (Trout et al., 2008), and canopy growth has been shown to be a key factor
    determining grapevine water use (Williams and Ayars, 2005). In other works, however,
    the inclusion of NDVI in their modelling did not improve the assessment of the
    sensitivity to water stress (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2020), and these authors hypothesized
    that this lack of importance was related to a small range of variation in the
    NDVI in their plots, as this spectral index is not particularly sensitive to vigor
    differences in very dense canopies. This was not the case of the present work,
    as NDVI ranged from ~0.50–0.80 in both seasons (data not shown) and was found
    to be significant among water treatments for most of the sampling dates in the
    two seasons. In the plots of the three best regression models (those from the
    two separate seasons and the global one), the 1:1 line and the prediction line
    intercept at a value of the measured Ψs equal to − 1.2 to − 1.3 MPa, that is at
    a moderate water stress (Leeuwen et al., 2009). For values of measured Ψs higher
    than this X value, representing plants of lower to non-existent water stress,
    the model yields a lower value of Ψs, leading to a conservative prediction. On
    the other hand, for values of measured Ψs lower than − 1.2 or − 1.3 MPa (that
    is moderate to severe water stress), the model is slightly optimistic and tends
    to sub estimate Ψs between 0.13 and 0.20 MPa, which does not substantially change
    the interpretation of the plant water status, hence the decision making about
    irrigation scheduling. The results obtained in this study are in good agreement
    with those of a previous work carried out on-the-go, in which a more sophisticated
    thermal camera, requiring post-processing and expert intervention, was needed
    (Gutiérrez et al., 2018). Very recently, an infrared radiometer was also coupled
    to weather and multispectral sensors, all of them installed in an autonomous ground
    robot moving at ~1 Km/h to estimate the leaf water potential, at morning and midday
    timings, in a Touriga Nacional vineyard in Portugal (Fernández-Novales et al.,
    2021). At midday, the determination coefficient values of the present work were
    superior (~0.63) to those of the study in Portugal (~0.39) while the RMSECV were
    comparable (0.124 MPa, in year 2020) or higher (0.206 MPa, in year 2019) than
    those reported in Fernández-Novales et al. (2021), with values between 0.125 and
    0.142 MPa. It is worth pointing out that similar outcomes have been observed for
    the estimation of the midday stem water potential (ψs) in the present work at
    a monitoring speed (3 Km/h), that was three times larger than that of the Portugal’s
    work (Fernández-Novales et al., 2021), thus confirming the feasibility of conducting
    meaningful spectral measurements on-the-go at a speed used in commercial viticultural
    operations. This opens the possibility of installing the infrared radiometer,
    and the suite of environmental and multispectral sensors in a conventional tractor
    or another viticulture machine to monitor the vineyard water status at a reasonable
    speed, while conducting a routine operation, such as tilling. Similarly, the results
    of the present work were comparable in terms of RMSECV to the outcomes reported
    by Diago et al. (2018) and Fernández-Novales et al. (2018), who developed a new
    methodology based on the use of near infrared spectroscopy on-the-go to assess
    the plant water status variability within a vineyard (measured as Ψs). However,
    the need of handling a huge amount of spectral information (as the complete spectra
    was used), pre-processing of spectra and outlier removal, which had to be conducted
    by trained people after data acquisition make this spectral approach more time
    and labour consuming, and more expensive, both in equipment and human labour,
    than the one presented in the current work. Two reasons that could have influenced
    the obtained results, that is the performance indicators (R2cv and RMSECV) of
    the estimation of the Ψs from the canopy temperature alone (direct relationship)
    and with ancillary data (multivariate predictive mode) could rely on the differences
    between leaf temperature (Costa et al., 2012) and canopy temperature (which is
    the one recorded with the infrared radiometer), as well as on the differential
    sensitivity of Ψs vs stomatal conductance to changes in water availability in
    the soil. Regarding the differences between leaf and canopy temperature Maes and
    Steppe (2012) reported that these two temperatures can vary with several degrees
    within, and between plants, as a consequence of differences in leaf angle, dimension
    and emissivity within a canopy, as well as from the fact that canopy temperature
    is a composite of surface temperature of different materials, including leaves,
    gaps and wood. In this work, the infrared radiometer model (with FOV of 61.9°
    X 48.5° horizontal and vertical) and its positioning in the moving vehicle relative
    to the grapevine canopy were chosen so as to have a measuring window of 33 cm
    of diameter, being a tradeoff between the representativeness of the measured area,
    and the minimization of the presence of objects other than leaves (eg. gaps or
    wood) in the measuring spot. Moreover, it has also been postulated that the higher
    the plant water stress, the larger the variability of the leaf temperature in
    a given canopy (Maes and Steppe, 2012). This could certainly influence the average
    value of the canopy temperature recorded by an infrared radiometer, as it averages
    the temperature data in the measuring window, whose variability will be higher
    when the grapevine becomes more water stressed, at least to a given level (Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2012). On the other hand, the differential degree of isohidricity (Schultz,
    2003, Martínez-Vilalta et al., 2014), that is the differential sensitivity of
    the hydraulic mechanism of plants (which mostly regulates the plant water potential)
    compared to the stomatal regulation against a diminishment of the soil water availability,
    could also yield different relationships between leaf or canopy temperature and
    plant stem water potential. Since leaf temperature is closely linked to the stomatal
    conductance (hence stomatal regulation), different response to water deficit between
    stomata regulation and plant hydraulics would potentially cause divergences in
    the behavior of plant temperature versus plant water potential. In this regard,
    stomatal conductance has been reported to be better estimated from thermal information
    (CWSI) than Ψs in grapevines (Grant et al., 2016, Sepúlveda-Reyes et al., 2016)
    and olive trees (Ben-Gal et al., 2009). In addition to the regression approach,
    aimed at estimating a Ψs value from the data gathered with the sensors installed
    in the moving platform, the capabilities of these data to distinguish among different
    water status within a vineyard plot were also investigated. Towards this end,
    LDA was carried out individually to each season dataset and the combination of
    both using only the six variables of the best regression models. Very good classification
    performance (above 74% of correctly classified samples) was achieved when plant
    water status values were classified as low, medium or highly stressed. From a
    practical standpoint, the very good classification capabilities shown by the LDA
    models with only six variables can be very valuable, as a discrete number (eg.
    2 or 3) differential irrigation sectors within a given vineyard plot may be established,
    to deliver different amounts of water or operating different time periods according
    the average lower or higher vine water stress of each sector. Overall, a combined
    approach involving the use of multispectral vegetation data and environmental
    information acquired on-the-go, contemporarily to thermal canopy measurements
    has proved to be successfully implemented to monitor the vineyard water status
    at a high spatial resolution. This provides understanding to the vineyard water
    status heterogeneity, required for the successful implementation of precision
    irrigation (Sadler et al., 2005) or variable rate irrigation (O’Shaughnessy et
    al., 2015), which are two of the potential techniques suitable to increase water
    use efficiency in viticulture. 5. Conclusions A novel methodology based on a combined
    system involving several non-destructive technologies, such as thermography, multispectral
    imaging and a set of environmental sensors mounted on a ground mobile platform
    moving at a speed of 3Km/h to assess the vineyard’s water status variability has
    been developed. This achievement may constitute an advancement from existing solutions
    to assess plant water status variability in a simpler and easier to automate way,
    at no expense of decreasing its performance as compared to previous thermography
    works involving the use of thermal cameras and reference temperature values. The
    combined solution requires the integration of environmental and canopy vigour
    data into the model built from canopy temperature for the estimation and discrimination
    of the grapevine water status and has been found to provide satisfactory estimation
    and classification of plant water status. Additionally, the system could be installed
    in a conventional tractor or piece of machinery, currently used in viticultural
    operations, and be able to meaningful sensing the vineyard water status while
    conducting another routine agricultural practice. However, further studies involving
    additional environmental variables like wind speed or solar radiation, which are
    widely recognized to affect plant water status, different grapevine cultivars,

  description: Soil water reserves are very important for irrigation scheduling in
    arid and semiarid conditions. In these regions, irrigated olive groves could save
    water and improve water resource management if the spatial and temporal patterns
    of water reserve were known. In this work, a large region characterized by olive
    monoculture located in Jaén, Spain was studied, as well as its water requirements
    and the evolution of the water reserve in the soil according to the time of year
    by using public data sources. In this way, climatic data, NDVI monthly mean, soil
    type, physicochemical and hydrological properties of the soil have been integrated
    in GIS by means of easy-to-use techniques. The results obtained from both the
    water balance and the evolution of water in the soil show that in the region studied,
    it is not advisable to manage a single irrigation schedule, as is currently the
    case, and that it is necessary to implement different irrigation times and strategies
    depending on the location of the plot. These results can serve as a basis for
    the design of specific irrigation schedules on daily, hourly or real-time time
    scales depending on the availability of data and the degree of precision sought.

    Versions Notes Abstract Soil water reserves are very important for irrigation
    scheduling in arid and semiarid conditions. In these regions, irrigated olive
    groves could save water and improve water resource management if the spatial and
    temporal patterns of water reserve were known. In this work, a large region characterized
    by olive monoculture located in Jaén, Spain was studied, as well as its water
    requirements and the evolution of the water reserve in the soil according to the
    time of year by using public data sources. In this way, climatic data, NDVI monthly
    mean, soil type, physicochemical and hydrological properties of the soil have
    been integrated in GIS by means of easy-to-use techniques. The results obtained
    from both the water balance and the evolution of water in the soil show that in
    the region studied, it is not advisable to manage a single irrigation schedule,
    as is currently the case, and that it is necessary to implement different irrigation
    times and strategies depending on the location of the plot. These results can
    serve as a basis for the design of specific irrigation schedules on daily, hourly
    or real-time time scales depending on the availability of data and the degree
    of precision sought. Keywords: agriculture; monoculture; olive groves; irrigation;

    According to World Bank data, agriculture is one of the main economic sectors
    in the world, with an aggregate value of more than USD 3.68 trillion [1]. However,
    its importance goes far beyond this. Sustainable agriculture generates income;
    can help overcome many of the challenges facing humanity, such as the fight against
    hunger or biodiversity conservation; and can guarantee production, since the demand
    for food and agricultural products will continue to grow over the next decade,
    along with their productivity, trade and sustainable use [2]. On the other hand,
    the climate change outlook predicts an increase in average temperatures by 4 °C,
    and a decrease in precipitation in arid and semiarid midlatitude regions [3].
    This increase in temperature would produce an increase in evapotranspiration and
    a change in flowering dates that could impact irrigation strategies and olive
    cultivar variety choice [4] Irrigation is very important in arid or semiarid environments
    where seasonal drought limits agricultural production [5]. Irrigated crops represent
    approximately 21% of the total area of cultivated land worldwide (approximately
    306.7 million hectares) and a production of approximately 40% of the world’s food
    [3]. It is estimated that 69% of water is used by irrigated agriculture globally
    [6]. From the point of view of productivity, it is estimated that in average terms,
    an irrigated hectare produces six times more than a rainfed one [5]. In the case
    of Spain, irrigated agriculture occupies approximately 20% of the total cultivated
    area and is responsible for 55% of the final agricultural production (FAP) [7].
    Olive groves are one of the major permanent crops worldwide. The olive surface
    represents 25% of the total permanent cultivated area worldwide, with 11.6 million
    hectares distributed in 63 countries around the five continents and extending
    over slightly more than 0.25% of the total cultivated land area. Of the total
    global olive grove area, 70% is distributed in rainfed cultivation, while the
    remaining 30% is irrigated [8]. Worldwide, one of the most characteristic regions
    of olive monoculture is the province of Jaen, in southern Spain. It is the world’s
    largest producer of olive oil, so a large part of Jaen’s economy is based on olive
    monoculture (in fact, the olive grove plantations occupy the majority of the territory)
    [9]. It represents more than 25% of the total olive grove area in Spain and 42%
    of Andalusia’s total cultivated land. Its production on average is approximately
    50% of the Spanish total of olive oils and more than 20% of the world’s total
    [10]. This territory has an area of approximately 13,489 km2, so due to both its
    size and biodiversity, it presents different agronomic conditions. The olive plantation
    surface in this location is around 5.93 × 105 hectares, of which 2.88 × 105 are
    rainfed and 3.04 × 105 are irrigated [11]. Most of the irrigated area is arranged
    in broad frames of traditional cultivation (88% of the irrigated olive grove area
    versus 12% of intensive olive groves) [12]. This study area is located in the
    arid and semiarid zones of the Mediterranean region, so water availability is
    a major constraint in crop production due to low rainfall and long periods of
    summer drought [13]. Although the olive crop shows good adaptation to drought,
    it responds very favorably to irrigation [14]. The incorporation of irrigation
    practices in the olive grove has allowed for the transformation of a rainfed crop
    with low profitability to a high-value crop that increases the farmer’s income,
    making it possible to obtain the maximum economic benefit and employment of labor
    per unit volume of water applied. Furthermore, in the area studied, the productivity
    of irrigation water used in olive cultivation is higher in socioeconomic terms
    than that of most traditional irrigated crops [15,16]. Water availability for
    olive groves is commonly below irrigation needs. Then, though they are irrigated,
    trees would be in water stress conditions during significant periods of the season.
    This deficit irrigation (DI) could affect the most sensitive phenological stages
    of the olive crop; flowering, fruit set and oil accumulation [17]. Thus, water
    deficit conditions have an impact on water stress in vegetation, which in turn
    has negative effects on crop productivity and can even affect plant survival in
    young groves [18]. Another common feature to most olive grove irrigation farms
    is the implementation of localized irrigation systems and a fairly uniform irrigation
    schedule, which depends on both water availability and a fixed maximum annual
    volume of 1500 m3/ha in traditional 10 × 10 m plantations [12]. Generally, the
    less dense an olive grove is, the lower the level of water stress, and therefore,
    the greater the irrigation water savings [19]. This lower tree density could permit
    deficit irrigation scheduling, which would allow for around 50% of water to be
    saved with mild or moderate water stress. This water stress level likely would
    not reduce fruit yield [20]. However, this irrigation scheduling requires the
    accurate measurements of the water reserve in the soil. Remote sensing techniques
    and geographic information systems (GISs) have been used to determine the evolution
    of water in the soil and to establish water management, namely both its use and
    productivity. Remote sensing makes it possible to study the spatial distribution
    and temporal evolution of biophysical properties or characteristics related to
    crop development by using a sequence of images [21]. The evaluation of crop variability
    through satellite images has been widely employed by correlating spectral information
    with biological processes of the terrestrial ecosystem [22]. On the other hand,
    geographic information systems (GISs) allow for the management of geographic information
    and its association with any type of descriptive information [23]. The use of
    the water reserve in soil in irrigation schedules and calendars means a lower
    expenditure of available water resources. However, we find that usually in large
    irrigated areas of the same crop, the same irrigation schedule is used without
    taking into consideration this reserve, which has a negative impact on the management
    of generally scarce water resources. The aim of this work is to propose an easily
    accessible methodology to accurately determine the evolution of soil water content
    for a given crop (olive grove) over a wide region. The objective will be to obtain
    the best possible information to elaborate the most accurate irrigation schedules
    possible in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Description of the Study Area The study area comprises the province
    of Jaen (Spain, Figure 1) and covers an area of 13,489 km2, in which olive groves
    are the most important Mediterranean fruit crop in the surface area [11]. This
    crop is the main socioeconomic engine in the province [16-Molina Moral 2022] and
    is constituted by 9 agricultural zones [24]. Figure 1. Localization of the study
    area and olive grove area, (olive grove surface in green). 2.2. Data Source The
    temporal evolution of the water reserve in the soil was monitored using the following
    data sources: - Climatic data are those obtained from the agrometeorological stations
    of the Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia (RIA) [25]. - Determination
    of the value of the crop coefficient: the monthly average NDVI indices were used
    from TERRA-MODIS satellite images obtained from the Andalusian Climate Information
    Network [26]. - Classification of the different types of soils: the soil map of
    Andalusia at a scale of 1:400,000, prepared in 2005 by the Ministry of Environment
    (Environmental Information Network of Andalusia, REDIAM) [27], was used based
    on the map published in 1989 by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Higher Council
    for Scientific Research; digitized; and readjusted with reference to the orthoimages
    of the Landsat-TM satellite, whilst also taking into account its characteristics
    [28]. - The physicochemical and hydrological properties of the soil were obtained
    and the water reserve in the soil was determined using the collection of soil
    maps of the Institute of Natural Resources and Agrobiology of Seville (IRNAS-CSIC)
    [29,30]. - The delimitation and location of the area and crop cover were obtained
    using the Information System on the Natural Heritage of Andalusia related to land
    occupation (SIPNA) [31]. This system establishes six hierarchy codes and has the
    occupation codes of the Information System on Land Occupation in Spain (SIOSE)
    as a cartographic base at a scale of 1:10,000. The modeling and processing of
    the data were carried out using the free software QGIS 3.18 [32]. The workflow
    used to obtain the data of the variables analyzed is shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2. Detailed flow diagram of the methodology, (GIS is geographic information systems;
    IDW is inverse distance interpolation; SIPNA and TERRA-MODIS are described in
    Section 2.2; climatological data P and ETo are described in Section 2.3; NDVI
    and Kc are described in Section 2.4; soil data are described in Section 2.5).
    Finally, a practical application of the described methodology was carried out
    by applying it to the study reduced to the municipal scope of the municipality
    of Cazalilla. (Supplementary Material File S2). In any case, these results represent
    a first approximation that should be more made precise and detailed in order to
    provide more adequate results as the scope of the study is reduced at the municipality
    district area, irrigation community, farm and/or plot levels. 2.3. Climatic Data
    To obtain the climatic data, a total of 18 automatic EMC/EMA-type weather stations
    [25,33,34] distributed throughout the provincial area and belonging to the Andalusian
    Agroclimatic Information Network dependent on the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock,
    Fisheries and Sustainable Development (RIA) were used [25], (Supplementary Material
    S1). Given the possibility of the existence of anomalies in the data [35,36],
    the R.Climatol package [37,38,39] programmed in R language [40] was used during
    the study period 2006–2020. Relative homogenization employs the SNHT (Alexandersson–Moberg)
    test and establishes a reference station calculated from a weighted average of
    neighboring stations that takes into account the distance between the different
    stations and a reference station [41,42]. A climatological series is homogeneous
    if its variations are caused by weather and climate variations, or if it is representative
    of the climate in the surroundings of the observation point [43]. The Penman–Monteith
    equation was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Precipitation
    (P) was defined as the water in the atmosphere that falls onto the Earth’s surface
    in liquid, solid, or liquid–solid form from clouds. Effective precipitation (Pe)
    is the usable precipitation, i.e., precipitation not lost by runoff or deep percolation.
    It can also be considered as the amount of precipitation that is stored in the
    soil without being lost though runoff or deep percolation and remains available
    to use by vegetation. It is the fraction of total precipitation that is used by
    plants. Its determination can be performed using simplified methods [44,45,46],
    regionalization [47] or GIS techniques of geostatistics [48]. The results obtained
    were represented in the study area by using GIS techniques with the application
    of the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method [49,50], with a pixel
    resolution of 5 m. Effective precipitation (Pe) is considered to be 75% of the
    rainwater [51] that manages to infiltrate into the soil without being lost to
    runoff or deep infiltration [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52].
    2.4. Determination of the Crop Coefficient The crop coefficient Kc varies during
    the growing period and depends on the development of the vegetation cover. Its
    determination is based on an advanced formulation of the procedure [44], which
    breaks it down into the sum of the basal crop coefficient Kcb, referring to transpiration
    [53,54]; and the Ke coefficient, called the evaporative coefficient, which includes
    evaporation from the bare soil. This model is referred to in the scientific literature
    as Kc − ETo, when it performs the determination of Kc in two steps [55,56] or
    IV-ETo when it integrates the vegetation indices [57] and allows the establishment
    of a good linear relationship, which is widely demonstrated both theoretically
    [58,59] and empirically [60]. Other authors take into account evaporation from
    wet bulbs [61]. The crop coefficient Kc is determined through the following expression:
    Kc = Ks ∗ Kcb + Ke (1) where: - Ks: the stress coefficient, with values from 0
    (maximum stress) to 1 (no stress); - Kcb: the basal crop or transpiration coefficient;
    - Ke: the evaporative coefficient, which depends on the growth and development
    cycle of the canopy. Values of Ks and Ke were estimated using those of the usual
    drip system and weekly irrigation [62], (Ks = 1, Ke = 0.05 was adopted). Calera
    et al. [63] estimated Kcb with the vegetation index NDVI: Kcb = 1.44 ∗ NDVI −
    0.1 (2) The above equation allows us to obtain Kc values from an image in which
    NDVI has been previously calculated for each pixel. The sequence of images, in
    turn, allows us to study the monthly evolution of the canopy, showing both spatial
    and temporal variability. Therefore, we can obtain ETc = ETo ∗ ((1.44 ∗ NDVI −
    0.1) + 0.05) (3) To differentiate between irrigated and unirrigated olive groves,
    information from the Andalusian Natural Heritage Information System (SIPNA) [31]
    was used. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was introduced by
    Rouse et al. [64] and is a measure of the value of photosynthetically active biomass.
    Its values are a function of the energy absorbed or reflected by plants in various
    parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in a range from −1 to +1. Two bands are
    used for its calculation and determination: near-infrared (NIR) and red (RED),
    which are different depending on the observation satellites used. The formula
    for its calculation is as follows: NDVI= NIR−RED NIR+RED (4) For the determination
    of the Kc coefficient of the olive grove, we used the TERRA satellite images captured
    by the MODIS sensor (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), with a spatial
    resolution of 250 m, obtained from the Andalusian Climate Information Network
    [26]; referred to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and studied
    the time series of this parameter during the study period considered [65,66,67,68].
    A total of 177 images corresponding to the period 2006–2020 were used, and after
    being corrected and georeferenced, they were processed and represented in reference
    to the scope by analyzing and studying their temporal evolution to obtain the
    monthly and annual mean values and their GIS representation in raster format.
    2.5. Determination of Soil Types Soil is a key factor in water balance as it allows
    for water storage, and therefore, its availability for the crop, so in deficit
    irrigation it will allow for the establishment of the irrigation schedule with
    greater precision. Its characteristics and properties (texture, depth, physical
    properties, drainage and infiltration) allow us to consider the soil water reserve
    to enable and improve irrigation efficiency in arid or semiarid areas, as well
    as the development and productivity of the crop [69]. One of the most important
    conditioning factors when applying deficit and regulated irrigation is the storage
    capacity or water reserve of the soil [70,71]. The soil map of Andalusia at a
    scale of 1:400,000 was adopted as the soil database [27]. The soils appear in
    cartographic units characterized by associations grouped at the second-order level
    following the FAO classification criteria and the 1985 European Union Soil Map
    with spatial resolution of 105 m [72,73]. For soil classification, several documents
    were studied and taken into consideration: the database of edaphological properties
    of Spanish soils [28], the determination of agrological classes at the provincial
    level [74] and the keys for soil taxonomy [75,76,77]. Thirty-one edaphic units
    were described in the scope of the present study (Table 1) out of a total of 64.
    Table 1. Edaphic soils unit of the study area, (legend table first above). In
    order to obtain the soil properties, we used the lithological maps of classes
    and subclasses of Andalusia elaborated at a scale of 1:400,000 and spatial resolution
    of 105 m from the cartographic and geological information of the Geological and
    Mining Information System of Andalusia from the detailed edaphological information
    of the SDBm-SEISnet database (1083 soil profiles) [29,30] compared and completed
    using the soil database of the province of Jaen [28]. It was possible to establish
    the dominance relationship referring to the different types of existing soils,
    finding 14 dominance codes out of a total of 21 for the whole of Andalusia (Table
    2). Table 2. Dominance edaphic codes unit and textures of the study area. The
    determination of soil water retention capacity as a function of soil type was
    performed by processing, digitizing and rasterizing Map No. 6: water retention
    capacity and equivalent humidity (whole profile) from the collection of the IRNAS-CSIC
    [29,30]. 2.6. Determination of Water Content in Soil Although the main variable
    determining soil moisture is precipitation, other factors (soil type, vegetation,
    topography and slope) influence its distribution both spatially and temporally
    [78,79]. Localized irrigation enables the application of irrigation in olive groves
    with slopes of up to 35–45%, although it notably influences distribution uniformity
    and application efficiency [80]. From a hydrological point of view, regarding
    the distribution and circulation of water in the soil, the following variables
    are usually used: slope, roughness, aspect, orientation, topographic moisture
    index, etc. [81,82,83,84]. However, when determining soil moisture, the explanatory
    variables that present a higher correlation are the physical and hydric properties
    of the soil. Thus, the aforementioned variables present a low linear relationship,
    and therefore a lower correlation [85]. Soil moisture content is measured according
    to its physicochemical properties, with the application of direct (gravimetric)
    or indirect methods (tensiometers, electrical resistivity, neutron probe, gamma
    ray attenuation, time domain reflectometry (TDR) or frequency domain reflectometry
    (FDR)) [86,87]. Other works use pedotransfer functions (ETFs) [88] or their estimation
    using GIS spatial modeling techniques [89], the combination of results from climate
    stations with soil sampling and subsequent analysis [90], the application of hydrological
    models such as SWAT [91,92] or the use of wireless soil sensors or soil sensor
    networks [93,94,95]. The maximum amount of water that a soil can retain is referred
    to as the available moisture interval [96]. The available moisture interval (AWI)
    and water retention capacity (SWRC) were determined as a function of soil type
    in the study area [97]. AWI refers to the amount of water theoretically available
    to plants that they can absorb. AWI was calculated as the difference between the
    values of the field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) levels [98,99].
    On the other hand, soil water retention capacity (SWRC) refers to the AWI in the
    soil profile up to the depth where the roots are located [100]. Therefore, we
    have: AWI =FC−PWP (5) SWRC=[ (FC−PWP) 100 ] ∗Z ∗ (1−f) (6) where: - AWI: available
    moisture interval, (in %); - FC: field capacity, (in %); - PWP: permanent wilting
    point, (in %); - Z: exploratory depth of roots (100 cm was adopted); - f: percentage
    of rock fragments (in parts per unit); - SWRC: soil water retention capacity (in
    mm). To obtain the water balance, the procedure described in Figure 3 was followed
    [101]. With this balance, we can quantify, for each period of time analyzed (in
    this case, each month), the behavior of soil moisture and determine both the excesses
    (those values that exceed soil saturation, and which give rise to runoff), and
    the moisture deficits (at levels close to the permanent wilting point). Figure
    3. Methodological scheme for calculating the water balance. In the study of wide
    regions, it is necessary to assume a series of simplifications for the calculation
    of the water balance. In the present study, it was considered that the only water
    input comes from precipitation (inputs), and only reference evapotranspiration
    was considered (outputs). Percolation, runoff and capillary rise (lateral or vertical
    water movements) were not taken into account. The balance was established for
    the hydrological year (the hydrological year is from 1 October until 30 September).
    At the crop level, water requirements were established by applying the simplified
    water balance equation based on the principle of conservation of masses [102,103].
    Thus, we can obtain ETc − (Pe + Ir) − SR − In = ±ΔW (7) where: - ETc: crop evapotranspiration;
    - Pe: effective precipitation; - Ir: irrigation; - SR: surface runoff; - In: infiltration
    of water in the soil. Considering the previously described simplifications, we
    can assume that neither runoff (SR) nor infiltration (In) occurred. In addition,
    no irrigation was considered (Ir equal to 0), so the final form the above equation
    is as follows: ETc − Pe = ± ΔW (8) This water balance was estimated monthly to
    identify the periods in the season when precipitation could be too scarce and
    could enhance problems of water stress. Finally, water reserve (WR) was calculated
    as the variations in soil moisture using the accumulation of water balance in
    each month: WRn = WRn−1 ± ΔW (9) where: - WRn is the water reserve in the current
    month. - WRn−1 is the water reserve in the previous month. - ΔW is the water balance
    each month. 3. Results 3.1. Climate Variable Values The climatic variables analyzed
    were the data corresponding to the monthly averages of evapotranspiration and
    precipitation during the period 2006–2020 obtained from the agroclimatic stations
    of the study area, (Supplementary Material S1). Figure 4 shows the frequency distributions
    of the data obtained for precipitation (P) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    at the agroclimatic stations. Figure 4. Frequencies of monthly precipitation and
    evapotranspiration during the period 2006–2020. The annual distribution of ETo
    and P showed water deficit conditions due to high values of evapotranspiration
    and low precipitation. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the monthly results of ETo and
    Pe. ETo was extremely high in all the studied zones from May to September, where
    the south-east zone presented the greatest values. Figure 5. Monthly variation
    in ETo. (Source of data: agrometeorological stations of the agroclimatic information
    network of Andalusia. The scale of color is presented on the left of the figure).
    Figure 6. Monthly variation in Pe. (Source of data: agrometeorological stations
    of the agroclimatic information network of Andalusia. The scale of color is presented
    on the left of the figure). On the contrary, Pe was almost null from June to August
    in all the zones (Figure 6). The month with the greatest amount of Pe was, on
    average, November. Although Pe was measured in May and September, the real period
    of rainfall could be considered only from October to April. The south-east commonly
    presented the lowest amount of rainfall in this latter period. On an annual scale,
    the mean annual evapotranspiration is 1237 mm/year, while the mean annual precipitation
    does not exceed 455.5 mm/year. Within the studied region, there was an important
    variation ranging from 386.1 mm in J01 (Huesa) to 552.6 mm in J16C (Marmolejo),
    which reflects the existence of a longitudinal and altitudinal rainfall gradient.
    3.2. Crop-Specific Values The analysis of the data obtained showed maximum values
    of NDVI in the autumn–winter period and minimum values during the spring–summer
    period (Figure 7). The decrease in NDVI during the phases of the greatest reproductive
    activity (flowering and fruiting) may be due to source–sink ecophysiological mechanisms.
    Similarly, when temperatures are high (>35 °C), progressive stomata closure may
    occur, and therefore, a decrease in or stagnation of shoot growth may occur [104].
    Figure 8 shows a graph representing the relationship between the NDVI and monthly
    Kc values obtained in the period considered. Figure 7. Average monthly values

    The relationship between these two variables is of quadratic type with a very
    high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.8696) [106]. There was a decrease in
    Kc values throughout the season. This is a well-known pattern of Kc in olive trees
    and is commonly related to the stomatal response to evaporative demand. The monthly
    Kc values obtained by applying Equation (1) for the olive crop range from 0.27
    to 1.08 (Figure 9). The greatest values of Kc were obtained in the north and north-west
    of the studied region. The pattern was similar in all of them, with maximum values
    in winter and minimum values during summer. The range of Kc during the common
    irrigation season from June to September was approximately 0.5, which is in accordance
    with the value reported in the literature [105,106,107]. Figure 9. Monthly variation
    in Kc. (The scale of color is presented on the left of the figure). The monthly
    evolution of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is presented in Figure 10. However,
    great variability for ETc values was found in the study area throughout the season.
    All the regions presented extremely high ETc values, mainly from May to August
    (more than 80 mm). ETc values lower than 50 mm were found from October, but even
    in this month, some regions presented some data of approximately 80 mm. During
    the period of the greatest values (from May to August), the north-west and east
    zones presented the maximum ETc. Figure 10. Monthly variation in ETc. (The scale
    of color is presented on the left of the figure). 3.3. Values of Soil Variables
    The range of variation in soil water variables on the map for average bulk density
    and depth explored by crop roots of 100 cm is shown in the following table (Table
    3). Table 3. Range of variation in soil water variables. The useful and usable
    water or maximum amount of water that the soil can retain is that corresponding
    to the difference between the field capacity and the permanent wilting point [96,98,99].
    For the determination of the soil’s available water retention capacity for plants
    (SWRC) [100], the influence of rocky fragments was taken into account whilst considering
    that an optimal proportion of these is between 10 and 30%, so a proportion of
    20% was adopted [108], obtaining a range between 82.8 and 182.0 mm (Figure 11).
    Figure 11. Spatial distribution and values of useful water (AWI) and usable water
    (SWRC). Soil water storage capacity allows for its utilization by the crop, and
    influences the previous water balance calculated by considering this reserve to
    improve irrigation efficiency [71]. Figure 11 presents a great variation in SWRC.
    The greatest capacity of SWRC was located in the north of the studied zone, with
    values greater than 180 mm. On the other hand, there were several locations in
    the center and in the east that presented values lower than 90 mm, even quite
    near to the maximum. Such variability in the SWRC could affect the water management
    in olive groves. 3.4. Water Balance By applying the water balance equation to
    the monthly maps, the monthly variation in this measurement was determined. Nine
    intervals were established, in which the red colors correspond to a negative balance
    and the white-to-blue colors to a positive balance (Figure 12). Figure 12. Monthly
    variation in water balance (ΔW). At the annual level, the values of the water
    balance obtained changed in a range of around 77 to a maximum peak value of −242
    mm during the month of July. This indicates that globally, the level of precipitation
    collected does not compensate for the losses caused by evapotranspiration from
    May to September, and therefore justifies the need for irrigation to enhance the
    development and productivity of the crop. During the first months of the year
    (January to April), we observed that a positive water balance was mainly concentrated
    in the northern and eastern areas, which corresponded to the mountainous forest
    areas of Sierra Morena and Sierra de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas, with a maximum
    value of around 77 mm in April. On the other hand, in this period, there was a
    negative water balance in January and February in the center of the studied zone.
    It is also highlighted that during the period from May to September, the evapotranspiration
    exceeded rainfall in all the months and zones, a situation that favors the presence
    of water stress and its effect on the critical phenological periods of flowering
    (May), fruit set (July) and stone hardening (August). Maximum evapotranspiration
    values were found in the northern and eastern zones of the area. On the other
    hand, they were more moderate in the central, western and southern zones, which
    have a marked and eminent agricultural character. The positive water balance was
    delayed until November, but even in this month, there was a small zone in the
    south-east where negative values were found. 3.5. Variation in Water Reserve in
    the Soil, (WR) The water reserve pattern is presented in the hydrological year
    (from October to September) because this would permit a better design of a strategy
    of water management. According to water balance and Pe distribution (Figure 6
    and Figure 12), the soil profile was empty at the beginning of October. The water
    reserve increased in the month of October in a localized and discrete manner in
    certain areas in the center and west of the area under study. The real recovery
    of the soil profile occurred in November in most of the zones, and only in the
    east zone was such recovery delayed until April. Maximum values were estimated
    in the month of April, with around 149 mm. It was also observed that at the beginning
    of the agricultural year during the autumn season, the water balance in the soil
    was greater in the central and western zones, which are predominantly agricultural
    and mainly used for olive cultivation, while during the spring, it was concentrated
    in the northern and eastern zones. From April onwards, the water reserve in the
    soil began to decrease drastically at the same time as temperatures increased,
    and consequently, the water needs for the crop increased (Figure 10). Soil water
    reserve was zero from May in most of the studied zones. The representation of
    the variation in the water reserve in the soil showed that during a long period
    of time (more than 33.3% of the year), its value was zero throughout the study
    area (Figure 13). Figure 13. Monthly variation in soil water reserve. (WR is water
    reserve in the soil. The scale of color is presented on the left of the figure).
    3.6. Irrigation Scheduling Taking into consideration the different layers of information
    previously developed, its application to any other crop (within the scope of the
    study area) would consist of determining the evolution of the Kc coefficient values
    in order to subsequently apply the simplified water balance equation (Equation
    (7)). This water balance was performed monthly given the generic characteristics
    of the study [109], although once the irrigation installation is completed and
    the crop defined, it can be performed daily [110], weekly [111] or seasonally,
    according to the crop cycle and/or arrangement of satellite images [112,113].
    4. Discussion Climatic changes are increasing the irrigation needs and the surface
    of irrigated lands. Moreover, the decrease in rain will produce a decrease in
    the available water. Therefore, water management will be improving at groves and
    at the basin level. This supposes different ways where farmers and technicians
    will have to optimize the available resources. They can mainly be put into two
    groups: hydraulic design and irrigation scheduling. Both are related and could
    limit the other. The current work is focused on the first one, the suggestion
    of a tool for delimiting homogenous zones and providing information for irrigation
    design, which will allow for easier irrigation scheduling using actual data. Data
    of the current work suggest that at least two zones could be considered with different
    periods of available water. Current data assumed simplifications that reduced
    the estimation accuracy (for instance: Pe estimation), but showed that even in
    these conditions, there were deficiencies in the irrigation decisions. Therefore,
    data suggested significant changes in the water management of the zone in comparison
    with the traditional fix calendar. In the northern and eastern zones, irrigation
    could be significantly delayed from March (current recommendation) to May. This
    strategy could extend the irrigation season until October when rainfall is still
    scarce. On the other hand, the central, western and southern zones had greater
    irrigation needs. Then, the irrigation season should be longer than the previous
    one, from April to November. This period started later than is commonly suggested,
    but also would need to finish later to decrease the effect of water stress in
    the oil accumulation period. The current work suggests an approach for organizing
    water resources in a big zone, even a basin. The results identified periods of
    water reserve depletion and zones where it occurred early (Figure 13). These data
    would not avoid water stress but they could help in the decision of irrigation
    scheduling in conditions of scarce amounts of water. The whole period from inflorescence
    development to fruit set was reported as a very critical phenological stage in
    relation to yield [114,115]. These periods occurred in our zones from March to
    May, which is the shift between the greatest level of available water and the
    beginning of depletion. Current data showed that the north and east zones could
    secure greater yields than the rest because of their greater water reserve (Figure
    13). Such variability is common all around the world, though olive trees have
    a narrow zone of growing. Examples of this variability are the works of Goldhamer
    (1999) [14] and Lavee et al. (2007) [116], who suggested different deficit irrigation
    scheduling. The former reported that decreased irrigation during summer (pit hardening)
    did not reduce yield [14]. However, the latter suggested no irrigation until pit
    hardening, though they indicated that in conditions of scarce amounts of winter
    rain this strategy could be not advisable [116]. The lack of agreement between
    both is likely related with the available water reserve in the soil. The improvement
    of the current approach is very important, especially if accurate estimations
    at the farm level were considered. The weak variables in the current work are
    likely the Pe and Kc estimations. Other components considered in the water balance,
    such as ETo or soil type, would be easily estimated using public data. Because
    the current work was focused on hydraulic design, the average data of several
    seasons would correctly estimate ETo and soil maps would estimate the capacity
    of water storage. Pe is difficult to estimate even with local data, because there
    are different components that could affect it, mainly the amount of rainfall [117].
    Although the seasonal pattern would be very similar, the amount of Pe during Autumn–Winter
    could affect the irrigation needs and the start and the end of the irrigation
    periods. The current approach, 75% of Pe, overestimated the recommendations of
    Villalobos et al., (2016) named the “FAO method”, suggested for arid zones [117].
    However, the current approach could be useful in these local conditions because
    the amount of precipitation is commonly very low (most of them lower than 50 mm,
    Figure 4) which could increase the Pe from this method. Fernández et al., (2011)
    in a location near to the studied zone (around 150 km from Seville but with similar
    patterns and amounts of rain), also used this approach of 75% rainfall in the
    comparison of several plant water status indicators in olive trees [51]. Water
    needs are also very affected by ETc, which in the current work was mainly spatially
    changed for Kcb and ETo data. Kcb is affected by tree development but also by
    soil management. Steduto et al., (2012) reported several Kc for olive trees depending
    of locations, date of the season and soil management [107]. The estimation of
    Kcb based on NDVI reported values similar and with the same pattern of decrease
    during summer because of the increase in evaporative demand (Figure 7 and Figure
    8) [107]. NDVI has been reported as very useful tool in olive trees for estimating
    spatial variations at grove level [118]. Therefore, the current approach based
    on this measurement would provide enough information for an accurate water balance.
    The main limitations of the current approach would be the assumption of 1 m of
    root zone. This value assumes that all groves are mature and would underestimate
    water needs in young. However, because the current work is focused on the hydraulic
    design, this limitation is null. Irrigation design has to provide information
    about maximum needs along the years in order to optimize pump dimensioning. This
    supposes that only mature groves have to be considered. The effect on young olive
    groves will be managed with seasonal irrigation scheduling. On the other hand,
    in some zones, soil depth could be lower than 1 m, and again, overestimate soil
    water storage. These data could affect the current final estimation and would
    be improved in further works. Finally, in terms of the precision of the results
    obtained from the different public information layers, the most limiting was that
    corresponding to the determination of the NDVI, which has a spatial resolution
    of 250 × 250 m. 5. Conclusions Knowledge of the availability of water in the soil
    in large areas of an irrigated crop is necessary when planning the management
    of water resources, especially in areas with limited available water resources.
    Its definition allows decisions to be made both on irrigation engineering (determination
    of the number and extent of irrigation sectors) and on the optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and timing (doses and frequency) to provide available water resources
    in a more efficient way. In the present work, the evolution of the water reserve
    in the soil for a given crop was determined through the management of public data.
    The adaptability of the methodology used makes it possible to study any other
    crop or cultivation pattern in any other zone, taking into account the values
    of the respective Kc coefficients to allow for the evaluation and determination
    of the water balance and water reserve in the soil; although in these cases, the
    application and justification of agronomic and technical criteria, as well as
    socioeconomic criteria, are precedent. The results obtained from the monthly variation
    in both the water balance and the water reserve in the soil in the area studied
    indicate that the use of public sources of irrigation scheduling data may take
    into account spatial and temporal distribution patterns and its specificities.
    Additionally, fixed irrigation calendars should be avoided to enable more efficient
    schedules. Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be

    Article Open access 28 March 2022 Introduction Agriculture is impacted by many
    environmental issues, including climate change, and degradation of land and freshwater
    (Foley et al. 2011; Hall et al. 2008). In agricultural regions, water availability
    is one of the most important factors determining crop quality and production.
    In recent years, there have been increasing demands on global freshwater resources
    for food production to support the world’s growing population. At the same time,
    freshwater availability has become increasingly limited in some production regions
    due to changing atmospheric conditions, aquifer overdrafts, extended droughts,
    and increased competing uses (Ficklin and Novick 2017; Richey et al. 2015). To
    develop sustainable agricultural systems, there is a critical need for accurate
    assessments of water use and increased water-use efficiency. Agricultural water
    management requires detailed information about crop water use and soil moisture
    status at field scales, which is conveyed by daily to seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration
    (ET)—the main form of agricultural water loss. Remote sensing data are well suited
    to providing accurate estimates of ET at the spatial scales required for agricultural
    management, with low demands for ancillary information and at low cost (Anderson
    et al. 2012). Over the past few decades, a number of remotely sensed surface energy
    balance (SEB) approaches have been developed for mapping ET that exploit the land
    surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite thermal bands as a proxy indicator
    of water status (Allen et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 1997, 2004, 2007; Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998; Norman et al. 2003). In particular, thermal-based energy balance
    approaches are sensitive to rapid changes in moisture status and, therefore, capable
    of effectively capturing vegetation water use changes. This is due to the fact
    that canopy temperature tends to change faster under stress than many other canopy
    biophysical properties reflected in optical imagery (Moran 2004). In addition,
    thermal signals are also sensitive to soil moisture changes under low canopy cover
    (e.g., early season irrigation). A suite of optical and thermal ET modeling systems
    form the basis for OpenET (Melton et al. 2021)—a powerful tool for improved agricultural
    water management providing field-scale ET estimates across the western United
    States. In addition, anomalies in ET (i.e., deviations of current ET from normal
    ET, as averaged over a relatively long period) show great potential for identifying
    agricultural drought onset and impacts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), defined
    as temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET), has proven
    to be a good leading indicator of stress, particularly in rapid onset, or “flash”
    drought events (Anderson et al. 2013, 2015, 2016; Otkin et al. 2013). Regional
    ESI generated at 4–10 km scale over the U.S. using thermal data from geostationary
    satellites has been demonstrated its utility as an agricultural drought indicator
    (Otkin et al. 2018, 2019). However, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of
    these products in some cases may not adequately separate the stress responses
    of individual land-cover types (e.g., crop vs. forest) and cannot provide effective
    guidance for field-scale irrigation management. More recently, attempts have been
    made to generate ESI at crop stand scale by using high spatial-resolution data
    (30–100 m) from Landsat (Knipper et al. 2019b; Yang et al. 2020, 2021a, 2018).
    To date, Landsat has been considered a gold standard for field-scale ET monitoring
    and stress detection, providing data in the visible, near-infrared, shortwave
    infrared (VSWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands required for SEB modeling, all
    co-collected from a single platform and with excellent calibration and registration
    (Anderson et al. 2012). However, the relatively low revisit frequency of Landsat
    imagery (i.e., 16 days for a single system; Table 1) constrains full reconstruction
    of daily and seasonal water use dynamics at field scales, particularly during
    periods of rapid change including green-up, harvest, intensive management, and
    flash drought. Previous studies have investigated the integration of other thermal
    data sources in addition to Landsat to improve temporal sampling. For example,
    the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides imaging for
    ET retrieval at coarser scales (~ 500 m) on a near-daily basis (Table 1). Fusing
    high-spatial/low-temporal resolution Landsat ET with low-spatial/high-temporal
    resolution MODIS ET timeseries (Gao et al., 2006; hereafter referred to as “Landsat-only
    fusion”) has proven effective in generating ET timeseries with both high spatial
    and temporal resolution over a range of land cover types (Anderson et al. 2018;
    Cammalleri et al. 2013; Knipper et al. 2020; Semmens et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017;
    Yang et al. 2017). Still, the accuracy of fused timeseries strongly depends on
    the frequency of the high-resolution ET retrievals anchoring the fusion process;
    therefore, other studies have investigated the utility of including other medium
    resolution thermal data sources in addition to Landsat. For example, Anderson
    et al. (2021) incorporated ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment
    on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) as an additional Landsat-like TIR data source. Xue
    et al. (2021) tested using TIR data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer
    Suite (VIIRS) I–5 band together with VSWIR data from Sentinel-2 (S2; Table 1)
    for augmenting Landsat ET timeseries. Both studies have demonstrated the value
    of additional temporal sampling complementing Landsat in improved ET monitoring.
    Table 1 Characteristics of satellite data used in this study Full size table In
    this study, we propose to combine ET retrievals from ECOSTRESS and VIIRS I-5 with
    Landsat imaging to provide even more frequent medium-resolution ET sampling capabilities
    (referred to as Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion). We evaluated the improvement
    in fusion results over Landsat-only fusion in capturing disturbance events (e.g.,
    rainfall, flash drought, green-up, and harvest) in which the resulting changes
    in crop water use are transient and not recorded in available Landsat scenes.
    These two fusion approaches (Landsat-only and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion) were used to create 30-m daily ET datacubes for the period of 2018–2020
    over three domains in California, U.S., sampling a broad range of climate and
    water management practices. The accuracy of modeled ET timeseries is evaluated
    in comparison with long-term flux tower measurements collected over these study
    domains. We also propose VIIRS M-band products to replace MODIS (soon to be extinct)
    as the new ET fusion backbone and test its feasibility. The goal is to lay a new
    foundation for future enhancements to projects including OpenET and ET-based drought
    monitoring, to demonstrate the value of more frequent thermal imaging, and to
    suggest methods for multi-source integration looking forward to the future medium-resolution
    TIR satellite missions. We also investigate the effectiveness of ET anomalies
    in capturing the impacts of crop management practices and stress in water use
    at both daily and monthly time steps and sub-field scales. The overall aim of
    this work was to evaluate the capabilities of the multi-source ET modelling framework
    for reconstructing daily and seasonal ET dynamics at field scale. Study area The
    study domain, as illustrated in Fig. 1, includes three grape-growing regions in
    California (CA), USA, that were sampled as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote Sensing
    Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al.
    2018). The three vineyard sites are near Cloverdale, CA (site name BAR); near
    Lodi, CA (site name SLM); and near Madera, CA (site name RIP). Together they sample
    a north–south gradient in climatic conditions due to variations in precipitation,
    temperature and humidity, along with different grape varieties, row-orientations,
    and soil types. The SLM and RIP sites are located in the Central Valley, while
    the northern BAR site is in the Sonoma Valley area. The climate changes from north
    coastal region to the southern Central Valley with decreasing precipitation and
    increasing air temperature. The BAR site has cooler and moister air conditions,
    while the SLM and RIP sites experience a warm Mediterranean climate characterized
    by warm days and cool nights (Knipper et al. 2020). The primary land cover type
    of the three sites is irrigated vineyards, surrounded with irrigated orchards
    and pastures, and unirrigated grasslands (Fig. 1). In addition to the GRAPEX sites,
    flux sites on Bouldin Island, CA sampling irrigated alfalfa (USBi1) and corn (USBi2)
    fields were also included in our analyses to test the utility of integration of
    data from multiple Landsat-like platforms. Fig. 1 Three study domains (Cloverdale,
    Lodi and Madera) in California, U.S. (center column). Flux tower locations are
    indicated with red stars on the Google Earth true color images (left column).
    Site photographs to the right are from PhenoCams installed at each flux site (colour
    figure online) Full size image The Central Valley aquifer system that supports
    irrigation in this agricultural production area is extremely stressed with an
    annual depletion rate of −20 mm year−1 from groundwater for the period 2003–2010
    and even higher during drought years (Famiglietti et al. 2011; Richey et al. 2015).
    The extensive groundwater extraction has resulted in land subsidence in many areas
    of the Central Valley over the last decades, partially related to regions where
    non-permanent crops and pastures were converted to long-term crops such as vineyards
    with a relatively inflexible demand for water (Faunt and Sneed 2015; Faunt et
    al. 2016). Possible strategies to deal with increasingly limited water resources
    include more efficient irrigation methods or converting to crops with lower water
    needs (Anderson et al. 2018). In addition, an improved understanding of the water
    use changes associated with these management practices is urgently needed. Previous
    studies (Knipper et al. 2019b; Semmens et al. 2016) focusing on these regions
    have demonstrated that the 16-day revisit of Landsat 8 was not enough to capture
    the vineyard response to stress. Other studies showed Landsat sampling was even
    more insufficient for crops like alfalfa which have higher ET temporal dynamics
    due to monthly cuttings, and pose a significant challenge to ET modeling (Anderson
    et al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021). In this study, we focus on a 3-year period from
    2018 to 2020 (2020 is a drought year), after the severe drought (2012–2017) in
    California. This period was characterized by a variety of meteorological conditions
    and soil water availability, with varying cropping and irrigation strategies in
    the Central Valley. A modeling domain of 90 × 90 km2 centered on the target flux
    tower sites was used. Detailed information about each flux tower site is provided
    in “Study sites and flux tower measurements”. Methods In this study we use a multi-scale
    ET modelling system to generate various ET data with inputs from multi-source
    TIR and SR data. A Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach is applied to sharpen
    raw LST inputs for DisALEXI to finer resolution. The output ET data on overpass
    dates are fused to generate 30-m daily ET time series using the Spatial and Temporal
    Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). A schematic diagram illustrating the
    flow of ET processing is shown in Fig. 2, with each component of the system explained
    in greater detail below and in “Data and analyses”. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram illustrating
    the flow of the multi-source ET modelling system Full size image Multiscale ET
    modelling framework The multi-scale ET modelling framework used here is based
    on the regional Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model (Anderson et al.
    2007) and the associated disaggregation scheme DisALEXI (Anderson et al. 2004;
    Norman et al. 2003), which are built upon the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB)
    model (Kustas and Norman 1997; Norman et al. 1995). The TSEB estimates the surface
    energy balance and radiometric temperature separately for the soil and canopy
    components of each model pixel, partitioned based on the local fractional vegetation
    cover or leaf area index (LAI). To reduce the uncertainty in remote sensing thermal
    retrievals, in the regional ALEXI model, the TSEB is used in a time-differencing
    mode by coupling with a slab model of the atmospheric boundary layer to morning
    thermal observations collected by geostationary satellites at relatively coarse
    spatial resolution (roughly 3–10 km). The DisALEXI component of the framework
    spatially disaggregates ALEXI daily fluxes by applying TSEB to finer-resolution
    thermal data from polar orbiting satellites. In DisALEXI, the air temperature
    is iteratively tuned at the ALEXI pixel scale to enforce consistency between ALEXI
    and reaggregated DisALEXI fluxes. This normalization process also ensures the
    consistency between DisALEXI fluxes from different sensors with thermal data acquired
    at different times of day, a key factor in successful multi-source data fusion.
    For more ALEXI/DisALEXI modelling details, the reader is referred to Cammalleri
    et al. (2013) and Sun et al. (2017). Multi-source data fusion scheme Thermal data
    sharpening In multi-spectral satellite imaging systems, the spatial resolution
    of thermal infrared (TIR) data is typically coarser than that of surface reflectance
    (SR) data from the same platform. However, the TSEB land-surface representation
    in ALEX/DisALEXI requires physical and spatial consistency between the LST and
    LAI inputs derived from TIR and SR imagery, respectively. To achieve resolution
    consistency between bands and platforms, the DMS (Gao et al. 2012b; Xue et al.
    2020) approach was used in this study to sharpen Landsat-like LST imagery (i.e.,
    Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS I–5 band) from native resolution (i.e., 100, ~ 70
    and 375 m, respectively) to 30 m and MODIS-like LST (i.e., MODIS and VIIRS M-bands)
    from 1 km and 750 m, respectively, to 500 m. DMS is a machine-learning algorithm
    that builds an ensemble of cubist regression trees between SR and LST data at
    the coarse resolution of the TIR bands and then uses these statistical relationships
    to predict LST at the finer resolution of the SR bands. To conserve energy at
    coarse resolution, the residuals between the actual LST and modeled LST at coarse
    resolution are interpolated and applied to the fine resolution LST image. VSWIR
    bands were used to sharpen Landsat-like LST images, while NDVI band was used for
    MODIS-like LST sharpening. It should be noted that the purpose of MODIS-like LST
    sharpening is mainly to reduce the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing
    (Gómez-Landesa et al. 2004). In this case, DMS was run using NDVI, similar to
    the localized TsHARP approach which was reported effective in prior studies (Cammalleri
    et al. 2014; Kustas et al. 2003; Semmens et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017). Note that
    in addition to the enhanced spatial resolution of LST, thermal sharpening also
    improves the spatial consistency between LST and SR (including LAI, NDVI, and
    albedo) inputs for the DisALEXI model, which helps relieve spatial misalignment
    in data from different satellite platforms or LST data noise that may come from
    an imperfect atmospheric correction. For instance, a modified DMS approach (Xue
    et al. 2020) with a relaxed scale of energy conservation was successfully applied
    to ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST sharpening to 30 m. ET data fusion Periodic Landsat-like
    and daily MODIS-like ET retrievals were integrated into a single 30-m/daily timeseries
    using the STARFM algorithm, which provides a feasible way for fusing remote sensing
    data from different satellite platforms (Gao et al. 2006). STARFM combines high
    spatial information from Landsat-like sensors and high temporal information from
    MODIS-like sensors to generate data with high resolution in both time and space.
    The STARFM approach takes advantage of the continuous phenology changes observed
    by MODIS-like timeseries to benefit the prediction between Landsat-like overpasses.
    In STARFM, one or more existing Landsat/MODIS image-pairs collected on the same
    date are used to predict Landsat-like images on other MODIS observation dates
    when Landsat data are not available. STARFM employs a weighting function describing
    the spectral, spatial and temporal relationship between existing Landsat/MODIS
    image-pairs to downscale MODIS images on prediction dates. One-pair STARFM uses
    a single image pair to predict images on dates surrounding the pair date, while
    two-pair STARFM uses two nearest image pairs bracketing the prediction date. The
    application of STARFM in ET fusion has been widely investigated over various land
    cover types and most of these works used one-pair STARFM due to its simplicity
    and flexibility in near-real-time applications (Anderson et al. 2021; Knipper
    et al. 2019a; Yang et al. 2017). While most previous ET fusion studies have used
    the one-pair fusion method, in this study, we used the dual-pair method described
    by Yang et al. (2022) as it has been found to generate smoother ET timeseries
    with smaller errors in highly dynamic agricultural systems. In this study, two
    categories of ET data with different spatial and temporal resolutions were directly
    retrieved using DisALEXI. One is high-spatial low-temporal resolution (30 m; periodic)
    Landsat-like ET including Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2. The other is low-spatial
    high-temporal resolution (500 m; ~ daily) MODIS-like ET including MODIS and VIIRSM.
    The two sets of ET data were fused using STARFM, combining each dataset’s strength
    to generate ET datacubes at 30-m resolution and daily time scale. We tested two
    fusion scenarios: (1) 30-m Landsat ET retrievals with 500-m VIIRSM daily ET; (2)
    30-m Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 ET retrievals with 500-m VIIRSM daily ET.
    The two fused datacubes were compared with flux tower observations to evaluate
    the value added by the additional temporal sampling from ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2.
    The two fusion schemes were also applied in simulated real-time scenarios based
    on one-pair STARFM. In addition, for the first scenario, we also fused Landsat
    ET estimates with 500-m MODIS ET, which was used as a benchmark to evaluate the
    performance of 500-m VIIRSM ET as the new post-MODIS era fusion backbone. Evaporative
    stress index (ESI) ESI is a remote sensing-based agricultural drought index, defined
    in terms of anomalies in fRET relative to a long-term mean. An advantage of ESI
    is it does not require information about the soil moisture status or rainfall,
    but rather diagnoses vegetation stress via impacts of elevated canopy temperature
    on the ET retrieval (Anderson et al. 2011, 2007). Normalizing by reference ET
    better focuses on the soil moisture signal, reducing the impact of seasonal variations
    of available energy and evaporative demand on actual ET. Here we use reference
    ET for a short grass under well-watered conditions calculated based on the FAO-56
    Penman–Monteith formulation (Allen et al. 1998). ESI has been demonstrated to
    be a valuable early warning indicator of stress at both regional scale (Anderson
    et al. 2013; Otkin et al. 2013, 2019) and sub-field scale (Yang et al. 2021a,
    2018). At regional-to-continental scales, ESI is typically calculated as a standardized
    anomaly relative to long-term baseline conditions. First, fRET composites are
    generated within 4-, 8- and 12-week windows moving with a 7-day time step to investigate
    the drought impacts at different timescales. Then standardized anomalies in the
    fRET composites are computed to highlight differences in moisture conditions between
    years, normalizing each composite interval to a mean of 0 and standard deviation
    of 1 using mean and standard deviation computed for that time window over a multi-decade
    baseline period. Currently, routine ESI products are generated over the continental
    United States (CONUS) and globally based on ALEXI ET, and have shown comparable
    accuracy with other standard drought indicators (Anderson et al. 2015). For sub-field
    scale stress analyses, a non-standardized fRET anomaly (named Δ fRET) has generally
    been used due to the shorter time-frame associated with these analyses (Knipper
    et al. 2019a; Yang et al. 2021a, 2018, 2021b). This study investigates the utility
    of both fused fRET timeseries and fRET anomaly (named ΔfRET) for stress detection,
    computed for the 3-year study period at both daily and monthly average scales.
    Data and analyses Study sites and flux tower measurements Each study domain discussed
    in “Study area” contains one or more flux towers equipped with eddy covariance
    (EC) and meteorological sensors measuring surface fluxes and micrometeorological
    data. Data collected at six towers are used to evaluate model performance, model
    crop biomass changes, and detect vine stress (Table 2). This includes four GRAPEX
    towers in irrigated vineyards, all equipped with similar instrumentation (Alfieri
    et al. 2019; Knipper et al. 2020). The BAR012 tower is located in the Cloverdale
    domain. The grapes in this block are Cabernet Sauvignon and planted in 2010 with
    an area of 10 ha. The RIP760 tower is sited in the Madera domain, with 31-ha Chardonnay
    grapes planted in 2010. Measurements of surface energy fluxes and meteorological
    data at SLM001 and SLM002 sites began in 2013 and in 2017 for BAR012 and RIP760,
    respectively. Table 2 Characteristics of flux towers used in this study Full size
    table Flux towers SLM001 and SLM002 are within the Lodi domain. Both vineyard
    blocks are planted with Pinot noir vines since 2009 and 2011 with an area of 35
    ha and 21 ha, respectively. The Lodi domain also contains two AmeriFlux towers
    (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/), USBi1 and USBi2, located in the California Delta
    regions (Bouldin Island). The two towers are situated in irrigated fields with
    USBi1 in alfalfa since 2016 and USBi2 in corn since 2017 (Anderson et al. 2021;
    Eichelmann et al. 2018). The observed fluxes from the two towers were also used
    in this study to compare with modeled fluxes. Model results are compared to flux
    measurements from EC systems as observed, and with a correction for energy balance
    closure error, which is reported on the order of 10–30% (Allen et al. 2011). Following
    previous studies (Anderson et al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021), a residual correction
    approach was used at most sites, assigning the energy budget residual to the daily
    latent heat flux. At SLM001 and SLM002, a modified residual correction was used
    to minimize impacts of nighttime shifts in wind patterns from off-field (Anderson
    et al., 2018). At each site, closure corrections were limited to 30% for days
    with closure errors exceeding 30% of unclosed measurement. Modeled daily fluxes
    were compared with both unclosed and closed tower observations under the assumption
    that these likely bound the true flux value and provide a metric of uncertainty
    in the flux observations (Twine et al. 2000). DisALEXI model inputs In the DisALEXI
    model component, CONUS-wide ALEXI daily ET at 4-km scale (Anderson et al. 2007)
    was used as the baseline for disaggregation. Other major inputs to DisALEXI include
    remote sensing data (LST, LAI, and albedo) and meteorological data (air temperature,
    atmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, wind speed, and insolation). Moderate ET
    at 500-m scale was obtained by applying DisALEXI to MODIS-like data and used as
    the fusion backbone. Three sets of sub-field ET at 30-m resolution were obtained
    by applying DisALEXI at Landsat-like scale. In this section, we provide a brief
    overview of the key inputs for each ET disaggregation scheme. DisALEXI-MODIS and
    DisALEXI-VIIRSM MODIS ET estimates at 500-m resolution were generated with DisALEXI
    (DisALEXI-MODIS) by disaggregating ALEXI 4-km ET using MODIS LST and VSWIR products.
    Three products from Collection 6 were used: LST (MOD11_L2; (Wan et al. 2015)),
    LAI (MCD15A3H; (Myneni et al. 2015)) and albedo (MCD43A3; (Wang et al. 2018)).
    The LAI and albedo products are at 500-m resolution, and the LST product provided
    at 1-km resolution was sharpened to 500 m using the DMS approach described in
    “Thermal data sharpening”. The VIIRS instrument follows the legacy of MODIS and
    collects imagery at two spatial resolutions: 750 m (M-bands) and 375 m (I-bands).
    In this study, we also generated 500-m ET estimates using VIIRS 750-m LST data
    with DisALEXI (DisALEXI-VIIRSM) and evaluated its performance in comparison with
    DisALEXI-MODIS, which has been used as the fusion backbone in all ET STARFM fusion
    experiments to date. DisALEXI-VIIRSM used instantaneous LST and emissivity version-1
    swath product (VNP21; (Hulley and Hook 2018)) constructed at daily timesteps and
    750-m spatial resolution, and sharpened to 500 m using DMS. Other inputs to DisALEXI-VIIRSM
    include the 8-day 500-m LAI composite (VNP15A2H; (Myneni and Knyazikhin 2018)),
    16-day 500-m vegetation indices composite (VNP13A1; (Didan and Barreto 2018)),
    and 1-km daily albedo (VNP43MA3; (Liu et al. 2017)) resampled to 500-m pixel scale.
    Both the near-daily DisALEXI-MODIS and DisALEXI-VIIRSM ET retrievals were gap-filled
    and smoothed to generate daily 500-m ET datacubes (Sun et al. 2017). DisALEXI-Landsat,
    DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 and DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS ALEXI ET fields were also disaggregated
    to 30 m with three sets of inputs from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 plus VIIRS 375-m
    LST, ECOSTRESS plus harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS). The Landsat 8 and
    Sentinel-2 data used in this study come from NASA’s HLS v1.4 dataset (https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/;
    L30 and S30 products) which provides a consistent surface reflectance data product
    from Landsat and Sentinel-2 (Claverie et al. 2018). For Landsat disaggregation
    (DisALEXI-Landsat), Landsat 7 was not used in this study due to gap stripes resulting
    from the failure of the scan-line corrector. Instead, Landsat 8 SR and TIR data
    from HLS dataset (L30) were used to generate 30-m ET retrievals at Landsat overpass
    dates. TIR data were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN (Cook et al. 2014)
    and then sharpened using DMS from 100 to 30 m for consistency with the SR data.
    30-m LAI was estimated by downscaling the MODIS 500-m LAI product using a regression
    tree approach (Gao et al. 2012a) and Landsat SR data. 30-m albedo was derived
    based on a narrowband to broadband conversion formulae developed for Landsat data
    (Liang 2001). The combined 3- to 4-day revisit of HLS makes it attractive for
    ET mapping at sub-field scales; however, S2 does not collect the TIR data required
    for ET modelling. VIIRS I-5 band provides TIR data at 375 m and near-daily temporal
    revisit. The combination of SR inputs from S2 and TIR from VIIRS has been successfully
    applied for 30-m ET disaggregation (namely DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2) on S2 overpass
    dates (Xue et al. 2021). Given that the S2 SR data from HLS (S30) are co-registered
    and spectrally adjusted with respect to Landsat 8 (L30) and resampled to 30-m
    resolution, S2 LAI and albedo model inputs were constructed similarly to Landsat.
    VIIRS I-5 brightness temperatures were downloaded from NASA LANCE and atmospherically
    corrected using a single channel inversion (Price 1983). The VIIRS LST data were
    then sharpened to 30 m by the modified DMS approach (Xue et al. 2020) using S2
    SR data as inputs. As demonstrated by Xue et al. (2021), 30-m ET retrievals from
    DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 show comparable accuracy with DisALEXI-Landsat, with performance
    slightly affected with larger view angles. As suggested by Xue et al. (2021),
    we removed VIIRS LST data with view angle greater than 52° in this study. The
    final set of 30-m ET was ECOSTRESS-based (namely DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS). ECOSTRESS
    is a thermal-only instrument, so the SR inputs for ECOSTRESS disaggregation have
    to be obtained from other satellites. In a previous study, Landsat 7 + 8 SR data
    collected closest in time to the target ECOSTRESS LST date were used for ET disaggregation
    (Anderson et al. 2021). Anderson et al. (2021) found that the temporal separation
    between SR and TIR inputs impacts the accuracy of ET retrievals. In this study,
    we use HLS SR data instead to generate LAI and albedo inputs because the 3-to
    4-day temporal frequency of HLS data are higher than combined Landsat 7 and 8
    (8 days). ECOSTRESS level-2 LST and emissivity (ECO2LSTE) and cloud mask swath
    products (ECO2CLOUD) were downloaded from USGS Land Processes Distributed Active
    Archive Center (LP DAAC) and gridded to the geographical coordinates. The ECOSTRESS
    LST data were resampled to a 30-m UTM grid to match with HLS data and sharpened
    to 30 m using the modified DMS approach (Xue et al. 2020), which was found critical
    to relieving spatial misregistration and enhancing the consistency in SR and TIR
    inputs to DisALEXI modelling. Anderson et al. (2021) found that the ECOSTRESS
    LST data at view angles greater than 20° resulted in poor sharpening results.
    Therefore, we carefully screened the ECOSTRESS LST data exceeding 20° before use
    and removed those with poor performance from further analysis. Spatial gaps in
    the generated three sets of 30-m ET images due to cloud cover were gap-filled
    using the technique developed by Yang et al. (2017). For days with more than one
    30-m ET retrieval, the order of priority for inclusion in the fused timeseries
    is DisALEXI-Landsat, followed by DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2, and DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS since
    DisALEXI-Landsat typically has the best accuracy. For more details about DisALEXI-Landsat,
    DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 model inputs, the reader is referred
    to see Sun et al. (2017), Anderson et al. (2021) and Xue et al. (2021). U.S. Drought
    monitor time series The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) is developed through the integration
    of a variety of drought indicators including precipitation, soil moisture, groundwater
    storage, and local reports from field observers. USDM timeseries data for the
    State of California and the Sacramento County (Lodi) from 2018 to 2020 were extracted
    from the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
    (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/TimeSeries.aspx) and used to demonstrate
    the crop water status under various rainfall and water management practices. USDM
    classifies drought into five classes and maps them with numerical values: D0 = 0
    (abnormally dry), D1 = 1 (moderate drought), D2 = 2 (severe drought), D3 = 3 (extreme
    drought), and D4 = 4 (exceptional drought). The timeseries show the temporal evolution
    of percent area covered by each class within a county or state. Model evaluation
    configurations In this study, the accuracy of ET retrievals was evaluated in five
    stages. We first evaluate the relative performance of 500-m/daily ET estimates
    from DisALEXI-VIIRSM and DisALEXI-MODIS, serving as the daily backbone in the
    STARFM fusion process. This is a necessary first step as we transition away from
    retrievals based on MODIS, which is nearing the end of life. We then compare 30-m
    ET estimates derived from, ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 on satellite overpass dates
    with Landsat retrievals as a reference, and with the flux tower observations.
    To compare with tower observations, modelled 30-m ET were averaged over a 3 × 3
    window (90 × 90 m) centered on the tower location (Anderson et al. 2021; Xue et
    al. 2021), approximating the flux source area which is typically on the order
    of 100 m, depending on the tower height and surface conditions (Li et al. 2008).
    We note that more sophisticated flux footprint models (e.g., Kljun et al. 2015)
    may provide a more accurate comparison. We moved the center of extraction by a
    few pixels to avoid edge effects for towers located at field edges. For 500-m
    ET, the pixel containing the towers is selected to compare with fluxes measurements.
    Next, daily 30-m ET datasets generated from Landsat-only fusion and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion are compared to investigate the added value of increased temporal sampling
    frequency by the additional medium-resolution ET samples. In this case, STARFM
    fusion is performed in both retrospective (two-pair) and real-time (one-pair)
    modes to explore the benefits of the extra temporal sampling for real-time applications.
    Finally, the capabilities of the fused daily ET timeseries in capturing rapid
    changing crop conditions are assessed, including changes due to crop management
    practices and flash drought. Statistical comparisons with flux tower observations
    include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error
    (MBE), and relative error (RE = MAE/ <O>) where <O> is the mean observed flux.
    The MAE is a better indicator of model performance, while RMSE is more sensitive
    to isolated outliers (Willmott and Matsuura 2005)—for the fused timeseries, both
    metrics are provided for comparison. Results Evaluation of DisALEXI-VIIRSM 500-m
    ET To evaluate the relative performance of the VIIRSM and MODIS 500-m ET timeseries,
    modeled ET timeseries of 2018 from both DisALEXI-MODIS and DisALEXI-VIIRSM were
    compared with flux tower observations over the four sites in the Lodi domain (SLM001,
    SLM002, USBi1, and USBi2) (Fig. 3). Note that the 500-m pixel scale is much coarser
    than the footprint of the EC tower in each case (~ 100 m), so we do not expect
    perfect agreement between models and observations at this scale. Still, the comparison
    can provide some insights into the relative biases in comparison with ET observations.
    In addition, Fig. 3 also provides the comparisons of inputs to DisALEXI modeling
    including LAI, NDVI, and LST timeseries. For NDVI at the USBi1 site, we additionally
    have NDVI at 5-m resolution from Planet Labs in 2018, included only as reference
    (green line in Fig. 3) to demonstrate the monthly alfalfa cutting cycle. The daily
    LAI, NDVI, and LST timeseries from MODIS and VIIRS show good temporal agreement,
    and are broadly consistent with variability in the Planet NDVI at USBi1. Fig.
    3 Time series of modeled MODIS (black line) and VIIRSM (red line) daily LAI, NDVI,
    LST and ET, and the Planet Labs NDVI (green line) for SLM001, SLM002, USBi1 and
    USBi2 sites in 2018. Blue circles are closed (solid) and unclosed (open) ET observations
    at flux tower sites. Green and blue vertical bars indicate precipitation and irrigation
    data, respectively. Note that irrigation data for USBi1 and USBi2 sites are not
    available (colour figure online) Full size image Despite small biases seen on
    some days likely due to the local heterogeneity within the 500 m pixel area, both
    MODIS and VIIRS-based ET timeseries match well with the seasonal trends in the
    ET observations. The close alignment between MODIS and VIIRS-derived ET highlights
    the ability of VIIRS, as a follow-on instrument, in generating comparable 500-m
    ET estimates with MODIS and replacing MODIS as a new moderate-resolution fusion
    backbone. In addition, we notice the outperformance of VIIRS over MODIS in capturing
    the observed ET variability in a few circumstances. For example, the underestimation
    of ET from MODIS for DOY 230–260 at the USBi1 site is likely due to the abnormally
    high MODIS LAI retrievals around DOY 240 (Fig. 3), which were physically inconsistent
    with the LST inputs to DisALEXI. The TSEB land-surface representation interprets
    elevated LST in patches of very high LAI as a signal of canopy stress, and accordingly
    decreases the transpiration component of ET (Kang et al. 2021). Relative to MODIS,
    VIIRS in general shows a better performance in ET at USBi1; even though the dip
    in LAI around the DOY 270 cutting (see the Planet NDVI timeseries) is not reflected
    in the 500-m VIIRS estimates, the retrieved LAI values remain within a reasonable
    range. At the USBi2 site (corn), MODIS overestimates ET during the DOY 150–180
    period before crop emergence, while VIIRS better captures this dip due to the
    higher values of LST retrieved during this interval (Fig. 3). Consistent with
    the high LST, there is no precipitation over this period. The higher native resolution
    of the VIIRS M thermal band (750 m) compared to MODIS (1 km) may lead to some
    improvement in capturing spatial details at field scale. As an example, Fig. 3
    compares VIIRSM and MODIS 500-m ET maps at USBi2 and SLM001, along with 30-m Landsat
    or VIIRSI/S2 ET at the same day for reference. While both MODIS and VIIRSM reproduce
    the large-scale ET patterns seen in 30-m ET, the VIIRSM ET maps exhibit a larger
    spatial contrast than MODIS, especially for the more heterogeneous USBi2 site.
    For DOY 170, the low ET values at USBi2 pre-emergence are well captured by VIIRSM
    ET, but are not by MODIS. By DOY 184, the 500-m ET values are more similar near
    the tower (Fig. 3), although VIIRSM shows a higher spatial variability than MODIS
    and is closer to the 30-m Landsat ET distribution (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Comparison
    in spatial pattern of ET between MODIS (first row) and VIIRSM (second row) on
    DOY 170 and 184 of 2018 over a 9 × 9 km2 area around towers USBi2 (left two columns)
    and SLM001 (right two columns). ET maps at 30-m resolution are shown in the third
    row for comparison. Red stars indicate the location of flux towers (colour figure
    online) Full size image We further investigate the performance of DisALEXI-VIIRSM
    ET as a daily moderate resolution backbone for STARM data fusion. Figure 5 shows
    comparisons of tower observations with daily30-m ET estimates generated by fusing
    MODIS and VIIRSM 500-m ET timeseries with Landsat ET retrievals (i.e., Landsat-only
    fusion), respectively, over the four sites in the Lodi domain. Both MODIS and
    VIIRS-based fused ET show a reasonable agreement with measured fluxes, with generally
    improved performance from VIIRSM with R2 ranging from 0.69 to 0.84 and RMSE ranging
    from 0.73 to 1.36 mm day−1 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that VIIRSM will serve
    as a reasonable replacement for MODIS as it approaches end of life; therefore,
    we use VIIRSM as the fusion backbone in the following analyses. Fig. 5 Scatter
    plots of fused vs. measured 30-m daily ET for year 2018 for sites a SLM001, b
    SLM002, c USBi1, and d USBi2. Blue dots are MODIS-based fusion results, and orange
    dots are VIIRSM-based fusion results, with RMSE and R2 also given in corresponding
    colors (colour figure online) Full size image Evaluation of multi-source 30-m
    ET timeseries Evaluation on satellite overpass dates In our evaluation of multi-source
    data fusion, we first assessed direct 30-m flux retrievals from DisALEXI-Landsat,
    DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 on satellite overpass days. Scatter
    plots are shown in Fig. 6 comparing modelled daytime fluxes including solar radiation,
    net radiation, latent heat, soil heat, and sensible heat at all six flux tower
    sites on Landsat, S2, and ECOSTRESS overpass dates with measurements over a 3-year
    period (2018–2020). For latent heat flux, the model estimates are compared to
    both closed and unclosed flux measurements, which collectively are assumed to
    bracket the ‘true’ flux. Statistical metrics of agreement between measured and
    modeled latent heat flux are provided in Table 3. In general, all three sets of
    modelled flux components agree reasonably well with measurements along the one-to-one
    line, suggesting a good partitioning of the surface energy budget. The DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS
    and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 show comparable accuracy with DisALEXI-Landsat retrievals,
    giving similar RMSE values but providing more samples due to a higher revisit
    frequency. The mean RMSE of all the sites are comparable among the three data
    sources: approximately 1.06, 1.27, and 1.18 mm day−1 for DisALEXI-Landsat, DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS,
    and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 with closed flux measurements, respectively. In most cases,
    model agreement is improved with the residual closure correction, except at the
    USBi2 site where RMSE values are relatively large. Fig. 6 Comparisons of measured
    and modeled daytime integrated fluxes estimated from DisALEXI-Landsat, DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS
    and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 on Landsat, ECOSTRESS and S2 overpass dates for years 2018–2020

    modeled daily ET flux retrievals (mm day−1) on Landsat, ECOSTRESS, and VIIRSI/S2
    overpass dates at the six tower sites Full size table In addition to point comparison
    of time-series at tower sites, the agreement in spatial pattern among the three
    sets of ET retrievals and key inputs was also assessed. Figure 7 shows an example
    comparison over a sub-region in the Madera domain in 2018. Here, the ECOSTRESS
    and VIIRSI/S2 maps are from DOY 217, while the Landsat maps are from DOY 218 as
    the same-day overpass is unavailable. However, there was no precipitation on either
    day and the mean air temperature and insolation rates measured at the tower were
    similar, allowing a reasonably fair comparison. In general, the ET patterns are
    similar for the three thermal data sources. The LAI data used for both DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS
    and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 modeling are from S2 on DOY 217, and show good agreement
    with Landsat LAI from DOY 218. The VIIRS LST map has less spatial contrast due
    to the much coarser native TIR resolution (Bellvert et al. 2020; Xue et al. 2021);
    however, the DMS sharpening approach effectively improves the spatial contrast
    and detail, resulting in comparable spatial structure between the three sensors.
    The remaining differences in LST are largely due to the different times of acquisition,
    with progressively hotter temperatures as we move through the diurnal cycle. Despite
    these temporal differences in LST, the spatial patterns of daily ET from the three
    sources are consistent due to the multi-scale constraints inherent in the ALEXI/DisALEXI
    modeling system. Fig. 7 Spatial maps of LAI (first column), LST at native resolution

    of the Madera domain. ET difference maps (ECOSTRESS (VIIRSI/S2) minus Landsat)
    are shown in top (middle) panel of the fifth column, respectively. The acquisition
    time of LST data is also listed Full size image Evaluation of fused daily timeseries
    The comparable quality of the three ET datasets on satellite overpass dates suggests
    utility for combined use as layers within the ET fusion method, generating 30-m
    daily ET timeseries. Two ET datacubes were constructed by fusing 500-m VIIRSM
    ET with Landsat (Landsat-only fusion) and with Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2
    (Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion) over the period of 2018–2020. Time series
    of fused daily ET from both datacubes are compared with flux tower observations
    in Fig. 8. The modelled ET on Landsat, ECOSTRESS and S2 overpass dates, and daily
    total of rainfall and irrigation applied are also indicated in Fig. 8. Overall,
    both fusion schemes well capture the seasonal dynamics in ET measurements at all
    six sites. At SLM001 and SLM002, the Pinot noir vines were cut and grafted to
    Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, respectively, at the beginning of 2020, gradually
    regrowing through the course of the season. The relatively lower ET in 2020 than
    2018 and 2019 and the regrowth trends in 2020 were reasonably diagnosed by the
    model with no a priori information on management. Fig. 8 Time series comparison
    between measured and modeled daily ET obtained from both Landsat-only and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion at the six flux tower sites for the 3-year study period Full size image
    Statistical metrics in terms of MAE, RMSE, MBE and RE between modelled and observed
    ET at daily and weekly scales for both fusion schemes are given in Table 4. Both
    fusion schemes give MAE (RMSE) of 0.52–0.69 (0.69–0.94) mm day−1 at a daily timestep
    for all four vineyard flux sites. The results are consistent with the previous
    ALEXI/DisALEXI-based studies at vineyard sites with RMSE ranging between 0.7 and
    1.0 mm day−1 (Anderson et al. 2018; Knipper et al. 2020, 2019a; Semmens et al.
    2016; Xue et al. 2021) and other remote sensing-based models such as METRIC with
    RMSE of 0.6–1.1 mm day−1 (Carrasco-Benavides et al. 2012; Galleguillos et al.
    2011). This also aligns with the target model error of ± 0.8 mm day−1 suggested
    by Seguin et al. (1999) for the field scale of agricultural and hydrological studies.
    Irrigation decision making often occurs at the weekly timescale, where MAE (RMSE)
    reduces to 0.44–0.62 (0.56–0.87) mm day−1 due to time averaging of random errors.
    The model errors are more pronounced at the USBi1 and USBi2 sites relative to
    the vineyard sites, in part due to the inherent greater ET temporal variation
    at these sites (Xue et al. 2021). Table 4 Statistical metrics of comparison between
    measured (closed) and modeled ET (mm day−1) obtained from both Landsat-only and
    Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion at daily and weekly timesteps over the
    3-year study period Full size table At all but the SLM vineyard sites, performance
    in daily and weekly ET improved in terms of MAE, RMSE and/or MBE with the extra
    sampling in the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion, as did the Nash–Sutcliffe
    coefficient of efficiency (not shown). At the SLM sites, performance was slightly
    disimproved with the inclusion of ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 in these retrospective
    analyses. At these sites, the temporal dynamics were already reasonably reproduced
    using Landsat alone, and adding the lower quality supplementary retrievals (especially
    ECOSTRESS, see Table 3) served to add noise to the timeseries. In future studies,
    a weighting scheme will be evaluated, enabling differential strength of contribution
    to the fused timeseries based on sensor retrieval accuracy (Table 3). We note,
    however, that the multi-source retrievals do add value at these sites in real-time
    mode (see “Value for real-time applications”). Added value of extra temporal sampling
    Capturing rapid changes At many sites, the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion
    shows an improved performance in capturing ET temporal dynamics than Landsat-only
    fusion, yielding smaller errors in comparison with observations. For instance,
    at the USBi1 site the incorporation of ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 data results in
    a reduction in RMSE from 1.42 to 1.29 mm day−1 and 1.21 to 1.07 mm day−1 at daily
    and weekly time steps (Table 4), respectively. The monthly cutting of alfalfa
    and following quick regrowing result in strong ET temporal variations, making
    it difficult for Landsat-only fusion to reproduce the frequent ET changes due
    to insufficient Landsat scenes. The extra ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 samples provide
    key complements to Landsat in capturing the monthly peaks and lows. Figure 9 shows
    one representative example demonstrating the significant benefit of extra samples
    in helping capture ET dynamics. For the period of DOY 90–210 in 2020, the alfalfa
    at USBi1 was cut three times on DOY 116, 156 and 188, respectively. The ECOSTRESS
    retrieval on DOY 119 and VIIRSI/S2 retrieval on DOY 190 lead to improved estimates
    of the low ET after cutting in comparison with Landsat-only fusion. During DOY
    100–115, the increasing trend of ET as the crop with increasing alfalfa biomass
    is not captured by Landsat-only fusion. The VIIRSI/S2 ET estimate on DOY 115 elevates
    the fused ET timeseries to be closer to the observations. Fig. 9 Model-measurement
    timeseries comparison of daily ET at the USBi1 site during DOY 90–210, 2020 (upper
    panel). The dashed vertical lines indicate the alfalfa cutting dates. Bottom panel,
    photographs from a PhenoCam at the USBi1 site showing alfalfa cuttings on dates
    highlighted in the upper timeseries plot Full size image Additional ECOSTRESS
    and VIIRSI/S2 samples also improved ET estimates at the BAR012 site, reducing
    relative errors from 20 to 18% at the weekly timescale (Table 4). Further to the
    south in California, where clear-sky conditions are more prevalent, extra sampling
    from ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 did not lead to significant improvement in the overall
    statistical metrics at SLM and RIP760 site. Still, these extra samples are important
    in better defining local water use at key phenological stages during growing season.
    Looking in greater detail at the multi-source ET retrievals in 2018 over RIP760
    site in Fig. 10, we can see the added value of extra sampling. For example, a
    few ECOSTRESS samples over DOY 210–240 facilitated a better definition of the
    reduction in ET timeseries during the veraison to post-veraison stage from late
    July or early August (Kustas et al. 2018) in which the irrigation was curtailed
    (Fig. 10). During this period, the vines are still actively transpiring with the
    ripening of the fruit until the grapes reach the required sugar content by late
    August or early September for harvesting. In addition, one additional VIIRSI/S2
    sample on DOY 87 effectively filled a large gap in springtime (DOY 75–115), during
    which there are no clear-sky Landsat overpasses. This period of vine phenological
    stages from bud break to flowering with low vine cover typically has significant
    cover crop biomass (Fig. 10). An ET acquisition near the bud break (around DOY
    90)—start of the vine growing season- is very important for monitoring cover crop
    water use and in making decisions on initiating irrigation. Fig. 10 Comparison
    between measured and modeled ET retrievals obtained from DisALEXI-Landsat, DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS,
    and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 at RIP760 in 2018 (top panel). Photographs in the bottom
    row are from a PhenoCam in the RIP760 site and show vineyard canopy conditions
    on dates highlighted in the top panel Full size image Value for real-time applications
    The ET fusion results in “Evaluation of fused daily timeseries” and “Capturing
    rapid changes” were generated retrospectively by using all image-pairs available
    before and after each prediction date. In this case, clear-sky Landsat overpasses
    may often be sufficient to capture the ET dynamics over vineyard sites in central
    and southern California. However, for operational applications, only the image-pair
    before the prediction date will be available, which tends to exacerbate the disadvantages
    of insufficient Landsat overpasses and highlight the value of extra temporal samplings
    from ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2. The importance of temporal sampling frequency for
    real-time applications was examined in this study. While data latency was not
    considered in this assessment, it should be noted that the added value will become
    more pronounced if there is a significant delay between data acquisition and public
    availability. We compared the weekly total ET from retrospective and real-time
    fusion modes for both Landsat-only and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion
    with measured ET at the six sites for year 2020 (Fig. 11). For both Landsat-only
    and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion approaches, the retrospective case
    exhibits a better performance than the real-time case for most of sites. In addition,
    for both real-time and retrospective applications the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    outperforms the Landsat-only fusion for all sites except USBi2—the regression
    line is closer to the one-to-one line with a lower RMSE. For all four vineyard
    sites (SLM001, SLM002, BAR012, and RIP760), the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion outperforms the Landsat-only fusion, reducing RMSE by 9.1%, 14.5%, 25.4%
    and 3.6% for the retrospective case and by 8.6%, 16.6%, 27.2% and 5.8% for real-time
    application, respectively. Fig. 11 Scatter plots of measured and modeled weekly
    ET in 2020 from both Landsat-only (LS) and Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 (LS + ECO + VIIRS/S2)
    fusion for both retrospective (-retro) and real-time (-RT) modeling schemes over
    the six flux tower sites. The red and green lines indicate linear regression for
    LS and LS + ECO + VIIRS/S2 fusion, respectively. The intercept of the regression
    is forced to zero Full size image In addition to these overall statistics, we
    further use USBi1 site in 2019 to demonstrate the increased value of extra sampling
    in improving real-time ET estimates at both daily and weekly time steps (Fig.
    12). Overall, the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion exhibits improved skill
    relative to Landsat-only fusion in capturing the temporal dynamics of measured
    ET for both retrospective and real-time schemes (Fig. 12). During DOY 220–280,
    the Landsat-only fusion gives somewhat different assessments of ET temporal dynamics
    in retrospective and real-time mode, while timeseries using Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion are more similar, particularly at weekly timestep. For example, for the
    week ending on DOY 234 (DOY 228–234), Landsat-only fusion in real-time mode cannot
    project the reduction in ET during the cutting cycle because it is using only
    a pre-cutting retrieval from DOY 219 (see PhenoCam photos in Fig. 12). This reduction
    is better captured in real-time with the multi-source timeseries. Similarly, the
    regrowth pattern for weeks ending on DOY 241 and 248 is poorly reconstructed in
    real-time with Landsat alone, but is better sampled with Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2
    fusion in both modes. Fig. 12 Daily (upper-left panel) and weekly total (bottom-left
    panel) ET timeseries in both retrospective and operational modeling schemes at
    the USBi1 tower site during DOY 200–300 in 2019. Photographs (right panel) from
    a PhenoCam at USBi1 site showing the temporal evolution of alfalfa canopy biomass
    on some key days Full size image Detection of vineyard water stress and changes
    in management The growth, quality and productivity of vine grapes largely depend
    on the water status. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) is one of the strategies
    used to optimize the quality of vines by imposing some degree of water stress
    in the vineyards during specific growing periods (McCarthy et al. 2002). The moisture
    stress factor fRET describing the ratio of actual to reference ET is related to
    the crop management factor (defined as the ratio of actual water use to crop water
    requirement) often used in RDI to track the spatial and seasonal patterns of vineyard
    water status in real time. Figure 13 shows a comparison between modeled and measured
    daily 30-m fRET timeseries over the SLM001 and SLM002 sites. The modeled actual
    ET is extracted from the Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion results and the
    measured actual ET is computed from tower observations with closure. The modeled
    reference ET is calculated using regional meteorological data while the measured
    reference ET is computed using flux tower measured data. Also shown are the remote
    sensing LAI timeseries on both Landsat and S2 overpass dates over the two sites
    (middle row), indicating the phenological development of vine grapes. The USDM
    timeseries over the state of California and over Sacramento County where the two
    sites are located are also shown in Fig. 13 (bottom row), reflecting ambient moisture
    conditions. Fig. 13 Timeseries of 30-m daily fRET obtained from both flux tower
    observations (black dots) and fused ET datacube (red line) over SLM001 (top left

    (mm; green bars). LAI timeseries on both Landsat and S2 overpass dates for the
    two sites (middle row). Timeseries of percent area in USDM categories for California
    state (bottom left panel) and Sacramento County (bottom right panel), respectively
    (colour figure online) Full size image For the two vineyard sites (SLM001 and
    SLM002), the modeled fRET time series from Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion
    agree well with the tower measurements (Fig. 12), suggesting that remote sensing
    can effectively supplement in situ observations used to track stress and inform
    vineyard irrigation. We note some negative bias in modeled fRET in the second
    half of 2020 as the vines in both blocks start to regrow after grafting (see the
    LAI timeseries). Lower actual ET observed in these blocks in 2020 is due in large
    part to reduced biomass post-grafting, but may have been exacerbated by severe
    ambient drought conditions as reported in the USDM for Sacramento County (Fig.
    13). The influence of both management practices and drought conditions is reflected
    in the modeled fRET during the growing season, approximately 0.6–0.7 for 2020
    and 0.8–1.0 (close to target level) for 2018–2019. Maps of water use and stress
    over this three-year interval (Figs. 14, 15, 16) give spatial context for the
    temporal behavior described in Fig. 13. Figure 14 shows the monthly ET over a
    3 × 3 km2 area surrounding the SLM001 and SLM002 vineyard site. The seasonal trends
    in water use are relatively consistent between 2018 and 2019: ET increases in
    the irrigated vineyards starting in the bud break and flowering stages in May,
    reaches peak values in June and July when the vines and fruit are growing rapidly,
    declines gradually after August in the veraison and post-veraison stage, then
    drops rapidly after harvest in early September with very little evaporation occurring
    in October (Kustas et al. 2018). In 2020, most blocks show a similar pattern to
    2018–2019 but relatively lower ET values perhaps related to the drought. The reduced
    ET in the SLM blocks due to the grafting is readily apparent in 2020. Fig. 14

    the locations of flux tower sites Full size image Fig. 15 Spatial maps of monthly
    fRET over a 3 × 3 km2 area surrounding the SLM001 and SLM002 vineyards for the
    growing season during 2018–2020 Full size image Fig. 16 Spatial maps of monthly
    fRET anomaly (ΔfRET) over a 3 × 3 km2 area surrounding the SLM001 and SLM002 vineyards
    for the growing season during 2018–2020 Full size image In comparison with actual
    ET, fRET is a better indicator of water stress since it reduces the dependence
    on seasonal atmospheric variations and radiation load and more focuses on variations
    in surface moisture conditions and plant status. Spatiotemporal patterns of monthly
    fRET at 30-m resolution (Fig. 15) also reflect the impact of management practices.
    In contrast to 2018–2019, for 2020 fRET in the two vineyard blocks remains below
    approximately 0.5 before August, reflecting the lower biomass and transpiration
    flux after grafting. Higher overall levels of fRET in 2019 in April–July compared
    to 2018 and 2020 may be related to drought relief in that year. These temporal
    differences in moisture and plant status are highlighted in monthly fRET anomaly
    (ΔfRET) maps computed relative to the 3-year monthly means (Fig. 16). From April
    to August in 2020, the reduced water use in the grafted SLM blocks is clearly
    indicated by significant negative anomalies. Negative anomalies were also found
    in surrounding fields in 2020, indicating water stress likely related to the regional
    drought conditions. In addition to crop management practices, ΔfRET also represents
    changes associated with land cover/ land use. For example, the negative anomalies
    in the alfalfa field south of the SLM002 vineyard in June and July 2018 change
    to positive in 2019 when a major land cover change is from alfalfa to winter wheat.
    Drier than normal conditions in the south-west corner in most period of 2018 growing
    season also becomes positive in 2019–2020 as the dominate crop type changes from
    winter wheat to alfalfa. In summary, spatial maps of monthly ET, fRET and ΔfRET
    at 30-m scale can help to monitor changes in local and regional water use, crop
    management practices and land use, providing valuable spatial and temporal information
    for decision makers to assess conditions and develop short- and long-term management
    strategies. Discussion Limitations and opportunities in multi-source ET mapping
    ET estimates with high resolution both spatially and temporally have demonstrated
    value for operational agricultural water management, including guiding precision
    irrigation at sub-field scale (Knipper et al. 2019b). In “Results”, we have demonstrated
    the added value of extra temporal samples from ECOSTRESS and VIIRSI/S2 for improved
    reconstruction of ET temporal dynamics over irrigated and intensively managed
    landscapes, confirming the applicability of the proposed multi-source fusion.
    However, the relatively low spatial contrast found in some VIIRS native and sharpened
    LST images might impact the accuracy of VIIRSI/S2 ET retrievals (Bellvert et al.
    2020; Guzinski and Nieto 2019; Xue et al. 2021). Future studies targeting improved
    regression tree algorithms used in DMS may consider adding other bands (e.g.,
    red-edge bands of S2) or incorporating microwave SAR data. The temporal discrepancy
    between HLS SR and ECOSTRESS LST data is also a challenge because inconsistencies
    between these inputs may impact both LST sharpening and ET retrievals (Anderson
    et al. 2021; Hoffmann et al. 2016), especially over landscapes with rapidly changing
    phenology or moisture status. Future studies targeting daily SR data based on
    fusion approach may effectively reduce temporal discrepancies and therefore improve
    ECOSTRESS ET estimates. In addition, differences in pixel footprints from different
    sensors at varying view angles can also affect LST sharpening, ET disaggregation,
    data fusion and the consistency of ET time series at fine spatial resolution.
    This is a challenging issue for all multi-sensor data fusion and applications,
    especially at field to sub-field scales. Although multi-source data fusion can
    partially compensate for the current lack of satellite TIR data with the required
    resolution, additional direct high-resolution TIR observations to complement the
    existing capabilities of current satellites are still desirable. A few on-going
    and future satellite missions with TIR sensors at sub-field resolution, including
    the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG; Cawse-Nicholson et al. 2021), Land Surface
    Temperature Monitoring (LSTM; Koetz et al. 2018) and Thermal infrared Imaging
    Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA; Lagouarde
    et al. 2018) missions will provide new data sources for advancing ET monitoring
    for agricultural water management. There are also spectral-based approaches using
    shortwave-infrared bands on Sentinel-2 that have a 5-day return interval and potential
    to contribute to increased frequency of daily ET (D’Urso et al. 2021). Consistency
    and compatibility of ET retrievals from different data sources are important for
    the multi-source ET modeling system. In ALEXI/DisALEXI, these issues are addressed
    in part by constraining each 30-m ET retrieval by a common dataset of ALEXI ET
    at a coarser scale. For other modeling platforms, a data harmonization approach
    or data screening scheme may be needed before using multiple sources in a data
    fusion system. Impact of sampling frequency In this study, the value of multi-source
    integration was investigated over agricultural target sites in California, many
    of which have relatively low levels of cloud cover and optimal clear-sky acquisition
    frequency. Future work will assess the proposed framework over diverse sites sampling
    a broader range of cloud cover climatology, including the more humid Central and
    Eastern United States where there is even stronger demand for extra sampling to
    complement Landsat (Sun et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2018). These sites may show a
    more marked statistical improvement in ET timeseries retrieval with multi-source
    fusion. With several new and proposed medium-resolution thermal imaging missions
    on the horizon, the question of sufficient collective revisit frequency for applications
    including agricultural water management must be addressed. Previous studies suggested
    that revisit period of four (Anderson et al. 2012; Guillevic et al. 2019) or five
    (Alfieri et al. 2017; Mercury et al. 2012) days would be sufficient for accurate
    ET estimation. Using the high-frequency set of multi-source California ET retrievals
    developed in this study as a baseline, we conducted a similar test on the revisit
    frequency impact on the accuracy of the fused daily ET. We started with a 4-day
    time interval, and randomly selected one 30-m ET sample for each 4-day period
    if it is available. The selected samples were then interpolated using 500-m VIIRSM
    ET as a scaling flux to produce daily ET timeseries. In this exercise, we used
    linear interpolation rather than STARFM fusion for computational efficiency, interpolating
    the ratio of 30-m ET to 500-m VIIRSM ET between selected overpasses and then multiplying
    by daily 500-m to synthesize a daily 30-m timeseries. To ensure robust results,
    we computed average RMSE with respect to observations from six randomly generated
    timeseries. Then we repeated this process assuming 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day intervals
    between overpasses. This experiment was conducted over the RIP760 site for 2020
    (Fig. 17). It can be clearly seen that the RMSE increases with respect to the
    revisit frequency. The results are consistent with Guillevic et al. (2019) who
    found that a four-day revisit provides a significant improvement over a 16-day
    revisit for ET monitoring and that the ability to capture rapid changes in ET
    was significantly reduced for revisit frequency lower than eight days. As pointed
    out by Lagouarde et al. (2013), only a one-day return interval can provide one
    cloud-free observation every five days on average in Europe. Overall, satellite
    TIR observations with high spatiotemporal resolution are highly desired in many
    agricultural applications. Fig. 17 RMSE between measured and interpolated daily
    ET derived from different revisit scenarios at the RIP760 site in 2020 Full size
    image Conclusion In this study, we evaluated the capability of combining multi-source
    remote sensing data for mapping daily ET at 30-m resolution over six flux tower
    sites in the Central Valley of California and Northern Coast for 2018–2020 to
    investigate the utility for informing agricultural water management practices
    and detecting crop stress. We first compared the performance of 500-m daily ET
    timeseries generated using VIIRSM and MODIS LST and SR inputs, and found comparable
    or improved accuracy, suggesting that VIIRSM can effectively replace MODIS as
    the fusion backbone of the multi-source ET modeling system as MODIS approaches
    end of life. The utility of ECOSTRESS and VIIRS I-5 band LST data together with
    the HLS SR dataset in generating 30-m ET was explored and the results demonstrated
    that these sources provide comparable accuracy to Landsat ET based on both qualitative
    and quantitative measures, in comparison with flux tower measurements. With additional
    temporal sampling from DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2, the daily 30-m
    ET estimates obtained from Landsat + ECOSTRESS + VIIRSI/S2 fusion generally outperformed
    the Landsat-only fusion for most of the sites, especially over an alfalfa site
    that exhibits significant temporal variability in ET over the growing season.
    Fused timeseries based on the three thermal data sources combined better captured
    temporal dynamics in ET over multiple growing seasons in comparison with Landsat-only
    fusion. The added value from extra sampling becomes larger in real-time applications,
    which could be further amplified when the data latency is considered. We also
    demonstrated the utility of multi-source fused daily ET timeseries for remotely
    detecting water stress signals used to manage regulated deficit irrigation in
    vineyards. Anomalous water use in two vineyard blocks in 2020 relative to 2018–2019
    due to changes in vine management practices as well as drought is well represented
    by the fused monthly ET and fRET anomalies. The changes in moisture conditions
    associated with land cover changes over surrounding fields were also revealed
    by the fRET products. Improved detection of anomalous water use and stress could
    help the managers to adapt irrigation applications in real time and therefore
    improve the quality and yield in grape production. Data availability The data
    analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author

    of modern houses, leading to an increased interest in consumer electronics which
    enable the automation of common household tasks. However, high initial costs,
    complex solutions, and closed systems mean home automation is still out of reach
    for a large number of potential customers. A cheap, open, extensible solution
    is therefore a must if IoT is to become a standard option for modern homes. In
    this article, we present an innovative solution to this problem in the form of
    an IoT framework called qToggle: a system for interconnecting sensors, actuators,
    and other data sources based on open source solutions and easily accessible components.
    To give a practical example of the uses of the new framework, we implemented a
    smart irrigation system, which can simplify garden care, while reducing water
    and energy consumption. The article describes details of the design, instrumentation,
    and software (mobile application) for the real time control of this system. Published

    Publisher: IEEE The world''s population is drawing close to 7.8 billion people.
    One third of this does not have access to sufficient drinking water with climate
    change and increased water demand being the main factors responsible. On the other
    hand, inefficient and primitive usage methods have led to 70% of the total water
    usage worldwide being generated by irrigation.[1] Increasingly, this problem is
    being tackled by the use of automated, smart irrigation systems, powered by the
    Internet of Things (IoT), which have become a key component in precision gardening
    and agriculture. The IoT has given a boost to smart agriculture, in terms of productivity
    and resource optimization. It has increased efficiency and has minimized the cost
    of production.[2] Smart homes, as part of the IoT paradigm, involve a networked
    system composed of various communication technologies and consumer electronics
    automating various tasks, including automated irrigation systems.[3] Each component
    of the smart home solution represents a key player in the overall “smart lifestyle”
    paradigm and needs to fulfill certain conditions for it to be optimal: ease of
    access to the public, open connectivity and ease of coupling with other components,
    online availability, and ease of usage. Automated irrigation systems help people
    control water usage in their gardens or fields and, thus, avoid water waste and
    minimize water bills. Moreover, smart irrigation systems aim to improve the quality
    of plant growth in gardens and fields by irrigating at correct times, with the
    appropriate amount of water, taking into consideration soil moisture levels and
    particular irrigation requirements in a given location. Replacing manual irrigation
    with an automatic valve system also eliminates the human error component. Smart
    irrigation systems also contribute by saving energy, time, and valuable resources.
    An IoT-based irrigation system is based on a smart microcontroller (e.g., an ESP
    chip). Soil moisture sensors are placed in the ground and send real-time data
    to the microcontroller, which automatically switches on the water pump when the
    values of the considered soil parameters are out of a specific reference interval.
    There is an entire discussion regarding the reference interval for these parameters
    (humidity, temperature, PH, etc.), because they are influenced by a series of
    factors: season, month, geography (continent, country, regions of a country: mountains,
    hill, riverside, etc.), type of soil, type of plants (grass, vegetables, cereals,
    etc.), and so on. In this article, we propose a simple but efficient smart irrigation
    system based on the Raspberry Pi. The irrigation system is part of an IoT framework
    called qToggle, a system for interconnecting sensors, actuators, and other data
    sources, with the aim of multiple automations, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.
    Smart irrigation system as part of the IoT based smart home controlled by qToggle.
    Show All Most smart irrigation controllers currently on the market are overly
    complex, with a wide range of capabilities, making them far too elaborate and
    expensive for small independent gardeners. On the other hand, smart irrigation
    companies usually only offer the irrigation controller and the app, we have proposed
    a complete irrigation solution, hardware, and software. Our goal is to provide
    a “do it yourself” irrigation system for gardens, along with three different scenarios:
    manual, automatic, and sensor-based automation. STATE OF THE ART Irrigation is
    one of the primary needs of agriculture. A lot of research has been done in this
    context and various irrigation systems, based on different technologies and using
    different devices, have been proposed in the literature. Some of them are cheaper
    than others, with different complexity or efficiency. Most of the proposed irrigation
    systems are dedicated to rural agriculture.[4]–[6] These systems are usually complex
    and too expensive for a small, independent garden, or are prohibitive due to the
    financial barrier. Garcia et al.[1] presented a survey aimed at summarizing the
    current state of the art of the research regarding smart irrigation systems. They
    evaluate 128 papers published between 2014 and 2019 and present an overview of
    the most utilized technologies employed to implement IoT based smart irrigation
    systems. Analyzing the papers already published in the literature, some conclusions
    can be drawn. The best node for an IoT irrigation system is chosen considering
    the necessities and the characteristics a user wants for the system. Arduino boards
    are the most used nodes for the implementation of IoT irrigation systems. Koprda
    et al.[7] proposed the automated control and remote management of an irrigation
    system using an Arduino board and the Android operating system as a solution.
    The system is fully controlled by an online interface and requires an active connection
    to the Internet. Arduino boards are used by Karpagam et al.[8]–[11] as well. Arduino
    is highly flexible, open source, not expensive, and easy to program. However,
    Arduino is not designed to handle the large complexity of more complex projects
    due to scaling issues. Garcia et al.[1] claim that 59 papers used an Arduino board.
    The Raspberry family was frequently used as well since they are more potent than
    the Arduino boards, having powerful computing abilities that allow the implementation
    of more demanding software and algorithms, hence the choice of the Raspberry Pi
    board for the proposed system. The selection of the processor (controller) depends
    on the characteristics of the IoT irrigation system considering the type of crop
    and the irrigation needs. The microcontroller used for the proposed irrigation
    system is the ESP8266 chip. The communication technology represents a key point
    to achieve successful operation. In many papers in the literature, the authors
    combine several communication technologies, for example, the authors use either
    a wired or a wireless technology to connect the sensors with the nodes, and a
    wireless technology to send data from nodes to storage centers. The most used
    communication technology in most papers is WiFi, probably due to its accessibility.
    Most low-cost devices for IoT usually support WiFi and small farms are able to
    provide enough wireless coverage with several low-cost devices. GSM and ZigBee
    are widely used wireless technologies as well, for example, Goap et al.[10],[12]
    GSM provides long-range communication at the cost of a mobile plan of the service
    provider that operates in the area. ZigBee provides low energy consumption, but
    it has lower data rates than other technologies and its range imply the deployment
    of many nodes. The communication used in this project is Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Most
    of the papers in the literature use sensors based on the conductivity between
    two electrodes, the most popular being the YL69 sensor, which was used in this
    article as well. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has also been used in
    irrigation projects by Astutiningtyas et al.[9],[10],[13]–[15] Most irrigation
    systems do not have access to the power grid or may only receive power during
    a given time period. The use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs, which
    is an advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas. Many surveyed
    papers use solar energy to power their proposed irrigation system. Starting this
    year, the irrigation system proposed will be using solar energy thanks to the
    photovoltaic panels installed. The contributions of this article are both hardware
    and software. The hardware part of project, including the system inside well and
    the piping part described in section “QTOGGLE as an IoT Framework,” has been designed
    and installed by the authors. In addition, the qToggle system, including the qToggle
    app described in section “Irrigation System Architecture,” has been fully developed
    by our team. Another contribution of the proposed system resides in the fact that
    it lowers the barrier of entry to smart homes by reducing upfront costs and preventing
    vendor lock in. This allows a wider consumer pool to access smart home solutions
    both for residential and industrial needs. QTOGGLE AS AN IOT FRAMEWORK The proposed
    irrigation system represents a small part of the qToggle project, which is a complex
    automation project, with many functionalities that could transform a normal house
    into a smart home. The system can be monitored and controlled from any part of
    the world very easily, using a mobile app, entirely developed by our team. qToggle
    proposes a standard way of interconnecting devices. qToggle is built around a
    flexible, but powerful application programming interface (API), allowing devices
    to work together. The idea behind qToggle is to control programmable systems having
    a TCP/IP stack via simple HTTP requests. These systems can be, for example, single-board
    computers or TCP/IP-enabled microcontrollers. Features that make qToggle special
    are the following: a unitary and consistent solution that integrates all required
    features, device provisioning and management, firmware update over the same unique
    API used by all devices, the use of expressions allowing intelligent and complex
    rules to be implemented between various sensors and actuators inside a network,
    hierarchical master–slave topology offering flexibility and scalability, user
    data staying within the premises of the local network, a cloud connection not
    being needed (for security and privacy reasons), and the integrated web app that
    works well on all major platforms (both desktop and mobile). qToggle provides
    a friendly user interface, which comes in the form of a progressive web application
    (PWA). The advantages of a PWA include the fact that updates are immediate (not
    being served by a vendor platform such as the Play Store or App Store) and there
    is one single code base shared among all platforms. qToggle is designed to be
    used in both mobile and desktop environments. qToggle has been thought as a way
    of interconnecting sensors, actuators, and other data sources with the purpose
    of multiple home automations, control, monitoring, and security, a system that
    could be continuously developed and improved. One of the key features of the qToggle
    IoT platform is its ability to run without a cloud connection. More precisely,
    many users are concerned with their data leaving their premises. Therefore, we
    designed the web app that runs on the mobile phone in such a way that it can securely
    connect to the hub directly, using HTTPS, without the need of an intermediate
    server. Simplifying the system in this way has the advantages of reducing the
    number of parties involved (and thus the overall latency as well as operational
    costs), while increasing the security. Probably one of the biggest differences
    between qToggle and its competitors is that our target audience includes users
    without a technical background, who prefer intuitive, off-the-shelf solutions
    with minimal setup requirements and a smooth learning curve. qToggle also caters
    to users who require an IoT solution that is cheap and easy to install, does not
    lock one in to a specific vendor and scales very well, thus reducing the entry
    barrier for home and garden automation, one of the major impediments to the adoption
    of smart home solutions. IRRIGATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The basic elements of
    the proposed irrigation system are: the well, the master hub connected to the
    Raspberry Pi, and the sprinklers network (including the links). When sprinkler
    heads are placed in the ground, they must follow a precise “architecture,” called
    “head-to-head” spacing, for the best coverage. This means that each sprinkler
    must overlap part of the area watered by the adjacent sprinkler. Even though this
    overlap might seem like a water waste, it is a real necessity. Without this overlap,
    it would be impossible to obtain uniform water coverage. Water pressure is another
    important parameter when designing an irrigation system. If the water flow is
    limited, the irrigation system is divided into zones to ensure there is always
    enough water flow to operate one zone in the irrigation system. For the case study
    presented in this article, we have divided the space into five zones (A-E). Thus,
    the system inside the well (shown in Figure 2) contains: five electric valves
    (Rain Bird DV/DVF valves), each one corresponding to a zone, one water pump, a
    Raspberry Pi board connected to the house LAN, a pressure switch, and an expansion
    tank. Additionally, for the scenario involving moisture sensors, Figure 2 includes
    the five sensors A-E, corresponding to each of the five zones. Each humidity sensor
    is connected to an ESP8266 chip. Figure 2. Diagram of the irrigation system and
    the system inside the well (the blue rectangle). Show All The Rain Bird DV/DVF
    valves (Diaphragm valves)[16] are premium products, representing the first choice
    of industry leaders worldwide, with more than 20 years of proven performance.
    The type of water pump is a standard 1.1 kW pump, with a maximum water debit of
    70 l/min. In Figure 2, the water circuit is represented with solid lines and the
    electrical circuit with dashed lines. The pressure switch is an electronic device
    that starts and stops the pump motor according to the detected pressure. We used
    the following model: Easy Press II, with a maximum pressure of 10 bar and a flow
    of 12 000 l/hr. The expansion tank has a volume of 24 liters and a maximum pressure
    of 8 bars. The aim of the expansion tank is to reduce the water pumpon–off switching
    rate. This is accomplished by accumulating up to 8 bars of pressure inside it.
    By limiting the on–offswitching rate, the cost is not only reduced, due to power
    consumption, but the life of the water pump is increased as well. The irrigation
    controller will ideally be controlled in turn by a master hub. While both are
    powered by Raspberry Pi boards, the controller is a terminal node in the network
    and is usually placed close to the valves. The master hub is typically installed
    in a central location as it serves as the nexus for managing all other interconnected
    devices. Even though there are various boards and platforms that could be used
    for this purpose,[17] our choice was the Raspberry Pi board. The reason for choosing
    Raspberry Pi boards, other than the low price, was the energy efficiency, the
    programming facility (Raspberry Pi uses Python, a programming language with relatively
    fewer lines of code and less complexity), small hardware footprint (RAM and CPU),
    the fact that it is future proof, the many available GPIOs, and its several roles
    in the IoT system, at the same time. Moreover, most of the software and projects
    done on Raspberry Pi are open source and are maintained by online user communities,
    always excited about new challenges. The humidity sensors chosen in this project,
    for the sensor-based scenario, are the popular YL69 from SparkFun and the microcontroller
    is the ESP8266 chip, a low-price Wi-Fi module perfectly suited for projects in
    the IoT field. The humidity sensors are connected to the irrigation controller
    and continuously send values for the relative humidity of the soil. These values
    are then grouped by zone and used to compute the min/max and average humidities
    for each zone. The automation consists in deciding how much of the total allocated
    watering time will be used for the respective zone. The proposed irrigation system
    can be monitored and controlled very easily, using a mobile app, the qToggle app.
    Using the qToggle app, users will be able to monitor and control the irrigation
    system from any part of the world. An important metric related to an irrigation
    system is the adequate quantity of water used for irrigation. There are various
    factors that influence the calculation of this amount: the geographical area,
    the season/weather, the type of soil, the type of crops, the type of sprinklers
    (each of them having their own range of precipitation rates and flow, depending
    on the choice of nozzle), water pressure, etc. Each type of nozzle has its own
    operating specifications, given by datasheets, for example, pressure (in bar),
    radius (in m) or flow rate (in l/hr). Here we employ nozzles with producer specifications
    as in Li et al.[5] Lawns usually need 15 to 25 mm of water per week, either from
    natural or artificial sources, usually a combination of both. To estimate potential
    water usage, we employ a simple but effective approximation: one liter of water
    will cover one square meter to a depth of one millimeter. Thus, to apply 15 mm
    of irrigation weekly, 15 liters of water are needed for each square meter. The
    necessary watering time can be computed as: t= Q n ∗A F , where Q n =15 liters
    needed for each square meter, A is the area in square meters, corresponding to
    each zone, F is the total flow (measured in cubic meters per hour) calculated
    as a sum of flows corresponding to all sprinklers in a zone. These calculations
    are no longer needed when using moisture sensors. The type of sensors used in
    this project are YL69,[18] a simple, low cost sensor used for measuring moisture
    in different types of materials. The output voltage for this sensor ranges between
    3.3 and 5 V and the output values are related to soil moisture: 0 to 300 for a
    dry soil and 300 to 700 for a humid soil, respectively. Each sensor is connected
    to the analog digital converter (ADC) input of a microcontroller (ESP8266 chip
    in this case). The ADC converts the input voltage into digital data that can be
    processed by the qToggle server running on top of the Raspberry Pi. In the end,
    the qToggle server is provided with five input values representing the soil humidity
    percentages for each of the five zones. A SPECIFIC CASE STUDY A suite of irrigation
    systems is described in the literature or already available on the market. The
    combination of technology and setup difficulty associated with each on them varies,
    as do their pros and cons regarding complexity, costs, performances, and so on.
    Our goal in this article is to present a “do it yourself” system that is simple,
    cheap, and performant. Figure 3 shows real pictures for the irrigation system
    inside the well. Figure 3. Real picture of the system inside the well. Show All
    In what follows, we consider three potential irrigation scenarios. Scenario 1:
    Manual irrigation systems. The manual scenario is based exclusively on human interaction.
    The user starts and stops the irrigation corresponding to the areas of interest
    whenever he wants, and in whichever zone(s) he wants. This scenario is useful
    when, for example, the weather changes suddenly (in case of a storm). Scenario
    2: Schedule based irrigation systems. The second scenario involves irrigation
    schedules. The user can set schedules, by turning on the Daily Schedule function
    on the qToggle app. Adjustments can be made using: Morning factor, Evening factor,
    Morning time, and Evening time. The user can select the time in the morning and
    evening when the irrigation should start and also select the amount of water by
    adjusting the Morning/Evening factor. We have computed (using 1) the minimum necessary
    run time for the sprinkler system, for each zone and we have obtained the following
    results: 10 min/day for zones B and D, 4 min/day for zone A and 6 min/day for
    zone C. These results should be adjusted taking into consideration the position
    of the garden (north/south), if there are shaded areas, if the summer is very
    hot, etc. If the proper quantity of water is not calculated, the tendency is to
    overwater. Figure 4 presents the irrigation setup on the qToggle app, for Scenario
    1 and Scenario 2. Figure 4. qToggle app for irrigations. Show All Scenario 3:
    Sensor-based automatic systems. Humidity sensors are used to determine the appropriate
    schedule for irrigation. The humidity sensors are set to measure the soil humidity
    at the time of the day when the schedules are set. If the soil is dry, the sprinklers
    will start, if not, the irrigation is postponed until the next scheduled time.
    The concept is straightforward: the sensor measures the soil electrical resistance.
    A low resistance value indicates a high moisture content in the soil, while a
    high value is a sign of soil dryness. This signal is given to the microcontroller
    (the ESP chip), which transmits it to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi processes
    the received moisture content data from the ESP chip and makes a decision regarding
    the water needs of the field, that is to say, open the electric valves or keep
    them shut. The valve in turn, acts on the pressure switch which commands the water
    pump. The sensor must be calibrated to reach the highest effectiveness of the
    irrigation system and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil
    type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Details on sensor calibration are
    given in.[13] The equipment with the microcontroller (ESP chip) and the humidity
    sensor is shown in Figure 5. The ESP chip is powered by solar energy. Figure 5.
    Equipment with the microcontroller and the humidity sensor. Show All When using
    sensors, the climatic parameters make the irrigation routine more efficient. Smart
    irrigation systems bring savings, in terms of lower water waste, but they also
    diminish the need for manual labor. Also, by replacing manually operated watering
    systems with an automatic one, the chances of crops dying due to excessive or
    insufficient watering are minimized. Some results are given in Table 1, for three
    months in 2020, in a specific village in Romania, where the system has been implemented.
    The results correspond to Scenario 3. It should be mentioned that zone B and C
    are south-oriented, Zone A is west oriented, and placed between two buildings,
    so it is mostly shaded, while zone D has trees and is also partially shaded. Without
    sensors, water waste would have occurred in specific days when the soil was still
    wet. Table 1. Results for Three Months, Scenario 3. The results obtained for water
    usage have been calculated taking into account the necessary run time for the
    sprinkler system, for each zone, the water debit of the pump, the number of rainy
    days (first column in Table 1), and the number of days when we have irrigated
    for each month (third and fourth columns in Table 1). The values presented in
    the last column represent the total amount of water, corresponding to all zones.
    Regarding the price, the whole irrigation system costs around 760 USD, including
    the system inside the well, the irrigation controller, nozzles, and piping network,
    while the irrigation controller itself retails for around 70 USD. The qToggle
    app is open source and free for the consumer. In comparison, commercial vendors
    typically offer their own built in system and application packages at higher costs.
    This also implies a lock-in factor for the user, as the applications and control
    systems are not compatible with other off the shelf components. As an example,
    the closest similar solution we could identify on the market is OpenSprinkler,
    which is an open-source, web-based smart sprinkler controller for lawn and plant
    watering. Nevertheless, just the controller costs alone can vary between 80 and
    186 USD in this case. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this article, we have proposed
    a simple, low cost, easily scalable, smart irrigation system that has all the
    above-mentioned characteristic. Our approach can be crucial in reducing water
    usage and waste in the house, prevent unwanted flooding or droughts, and reduce
    the overall time spent in watering and caring for the garden. Further, we have
    shown that by using real-life data from smart sensors, we can incorporate weather
    patterns and soil properties into the irrigation feedback loop. Because we chose
    off the shelf, open components, our system is readily available to anyone at a
    reduced cost, compared to other commercial solutions. Also, by avoiding vendor
    lockdown, our project offers seamless integration with other components and the
    qToggle environment, allowing the smart irrigation system to become an active
    component in the smart home with both offline and online control and reporting
    functionality. Finally, our simple approach to both the hardware setup and software
    application means most users will easily be able to make use of our system with
    little training required. In this context, we believe our smart irrigation system,
    as an integral component of the qToggle framework, can become a key player in
    the smart home market and is in line with current trends in consumer electronics
    and the main topics of interest in the field, specifically, interconnection, automation,
    and data awareness. Sprinkler systems require a certain water flow or pressure
    to operate properly. If there is too little flow or pressure, the irrigation system
    will not work properly. Even with the zone division of the lawn, sometimes, due
    to the undersizing of the water network in some villages. For example, in areas
    with a lot of new houses using the same water network, the irrigation system can
    face problems. Therefore, future versions will rely on artificial intelligence,
    which will monitor water pressure trends and will determine the proper interval
    for watering. Another future idea is the use of sustainable energy and photovoltaic
    panels for the valves and water pump. A prototype for the later is already being
    tested with initial results being promising. Authors Figures References Citations

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent
    on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an
    effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological
    data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated
    AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external
    data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for
    the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop
    control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000
    acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means

    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.
    Section 8 concludes the paper outlining future plans and work needed on this topic.
    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants

  description: The technological demands required to successfully practice either
    targeted irrigation control and/or deficit irrigation strategies are currently
    reliant on numerical models which are often underutilised due to their complexity
    and low operational focus. A simple and practical real-time control system is
    proposed using a model-data fusion approach, which integrates information from
    soil water representation models and heterogeneous sensor data sources. The system
    uses real-time soil moisture measurements provided by an in situ sensor network
    to generate site-specific soil water retention curves. This information is then
    used to predict the rate of soil drying. The decision to irrigate is made when
    soil water content drops below a pre-defined threshold and when the probability
    of rainfall is low. A deficit strategy can be incorporated by lowering the irrigation
    refill point and setting the fill amount to a proportion of field capacity. Computer
    simulations show how significant water savings can be achieved through improved
    utilisation of rainfall water by plants, spatially targeted irrigation application,
    and precision timing through adaptive control.

    demands required to successfully practice either targeted irrigation control and/or
    deficit irrigation strategies are currently reliant on numerical models which
    are often underutilised due to their complexity and low operational focus. A simple
    and practical real-time control system is proposed using a model-data fusion approach,
    which integrates information from soil water representation models and heterogeneous
    sensor data sources. The system uses real-time soil moisture measurements provided
    by an in situ sensor network to generate site-specific soil water retention curves.
    This information is then used to predict the rate of soil drying. The decision
    to irrigate is made when soil water content drops below a pre-defined threshold
    and when the probability of rainfall is low. A deficit strategy can be incorporated
    by lowering the irrigation \\“refill” point and setting the fill amount to a proportion
    of field capacity. Computer simulations show how significant water savings can
    be achieved through improved utilisation of rainfall water by plants, spatially
    targeted irrigation application, and precision timing through adaptive control
    Keywords: deficit irrigation, wireless sensor network, adaptive irrigation scheduling,
    model-data fusion, irrigation decision tree. 1 Introduction Australia is facing
    a severe water shortage due to below-average rainfall received over the past decade.
    The agricultural sector is the hardest hit by this as irrigation accounts for
    almost 65% of total water use nationally [1]. Long-term climate forecasts suggest
    that this situation is unlikely to improve [2]. Therefore Keywords deficit irrigation,

    4 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crop
    is sensitive to irrigation management. Irrigation efficiency, water quality, and
    yield production are concerns in southwestern Colorado. This field study was conducted
    in 1992 and 1994 at the Southwestern Colorado Research Center to study the effects
    of five irrigation rates on dry bean seed yield and dry matter. The soil on the
    site is Wetherill silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic, aridic
    haplustalf). A surface drip irrigation system was used to achieve the irrigation
    rates of 0.00, 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of the estimated evapotranspiration
    (ET). The experiment was set up using a randomized complete block design with
    four replications. Optimum conditions during the 1992 season led to higher dry
    matter and seed yields than in 1994. Irrigation rates had a significant effect
    on total aboveground dry matter (TDM) and seed yield in both years. There was
    no significant increase in seed yield and TDM beyond 0.67ET and 1.00ET, respectively,
    in 1992. However, maximum seed yield was obtained at a 0.67ET irrigation rate
    in the cooler year (1992), while 1.00ET or greater was required to achieve maximum
    biomass yield in both years. Total DM and seed yield continued to increase up
    to 1.33ET in 1994, reaching a similar level as in 1992. Irrigation use efficiency
    declined as the irrigation rate increased in both years. The pattern of biomass
    accumulation was similar in 1992 and 1994, as more growth occurred with the greater
    irrigation rates. Visual observations revealed a shallower root system under the
    higher irrigation rates than under the nonirrigated (0.00ET) and the limited-irrigation
    (0.33ET) treatments. This was confirmed by the soil moisture profile at harvest
    in 1992 and 1994. Dry bean can extract soil water from the 0 to 24 in. soil profile
    under dryland conditions, and from the 0 to 12 in. soil profile under well-irrigated
    conditions (1.00ET). Soil moisture content below 12 in. was at or near field capacity
    under the over-irrigation treatment (1.33ET), which suggests the potential for
    deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and other soluble salts. Over-irrigation
    appears to encourage a shallow root system, less than 2 ft. (field plant root
    inspection), which may reduce the use of soil moisture at lower depths and encourage
    deep percolation to the groundwater. Research Question Concerns about irrigation
    efficiency, water quality, and yield have prompted this study. Over-irrigation
    is a key factor that contributes to deep percolation and nutrient leaching to
    the groundwater. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of five
    different irrigation rates on dry bean yield response and water use efficiency.
    Literature Summary The dry bean is very sensitive to irrigation management. Studies
    indicate that dry bean yields can vary significantly as irrigation rates go from
    dryland to optimal rates. However, the increase in yield may not be significant
    with the increase of the irrigation rate beyond optimum water need. It was reported
    that dry bean can extract water from the soil profile much deeper under dry and
    limited-irrigation conditions than over-irrigated conditions. Study Description
    The field study was conducted to investigate the impact of five irrigation rates
    on dry bean growth response. The irrigation rates used in this study were 0.00,
    0.33, 0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of estimated evapotranspiration (ET). The soil on the
    site is Wetherill silty clay loam. The experiment was a randomized block design
    with four replications. A surface drip irrigation system was used to achieve the
    complete designed irrigation rates. An irrigation scheduling program was used
    to manage irrigation. Weather data from a local weather station on the site was
    used to estimate ET by using the Penman Equation. The water balance approach was
    used to determine the 1.00ET irrigation rate based on estimated ET, precipitation
    (total seasonal precipitation was 7.6 and 5.0 in. from June to September of 1992
    and 1994, respectively), change in soil moisture, runoff, and drainage terms in
    the 1992 and 1994 seasons. Applied Questions How does dry bean respond to different
    irrigation rates? Seed yield and dry matter increased significantly as the irrigation
    rates were increased up to the optimal water use (1.00ET) in 1994. However, maximum
    seed yield was obtained at 0.67ET in the cooler year (1992), while 1.00ET or greater
    was required to achieve maximum biomass yield in both years. Improvement in the
    yield was related to the water and irrigation use efficiencies, where yield production
    (seed or dry matter) per 1 in. of applied or used water was greater when the irrigation
    rate was kept at or below 1.00ET. Therefore, exceeding plant water requirements
    not only leads to waste of water, but also can affect plant performance and soil
    environment. What is the impact of the irrigation rate on soil water use or root
    moisture extraction pattern? Over-irrigation encouraged a shallow root system.
    The effective root depth under an irrigation rate greater than 1.00ET was 12 in.
    Conversely, limited irrigation treatments encouraged the development of a deeper
    root system and water uptake down to 3-ft. Also, the soil moisture profile under
    over-irrigated and 1.00ET was close to field capacity during the growing season,
    which may lead to potential deep percolation and nutrient loss to the groundwater.
    Recommendation Dry bean production in semi-arid climate areas like southwestern
    Colorado can be improved significantly by using proper irrigation scheduling.
    Irrigation scheduling can improve irrigation and water use efficiencies, especially
    in areas such as southwestern Colorado, where water management is critical to
    crop yield and water quality. The dry bean root system can use soil moisture more
    efficiently from lower depths (24 in. or deeper) when optimum irrigation was applied
    (equal to or less than 1.00ET). However, the irrigation scheduling program (SCHED)
    may have overestimated water requirements in the cooler year to achieve maximum
    seed yield, while predicting the water requirements needed for maximum biomass
    yield at 1.00ET or greater in both years. Irrigation provides the means to optimize
    plant water use and to increase crop production in many areas. Implementing sound
    irrigation water management practices is necessary to overcome excessive irrigation
    and eliminate many associated problems, such as nutrient leaching and surface
    runoff. This concept is critically important in areas such as southwestern Colorado,
    where deep percolation associated with over-irrigation combines with a saline
    geological formation (Mancos Shale), which contributes heavily to the salinity
    problem in the Colorado River. Therefore, irrigation scheduling becomes a crucial
    element in reducing deep percolation and improving water quality downstream. Another
    consideration is the efficiency of the water delivery system of the Dolores River
    Project, which was estimated at 87% compared with the actual water delivery efficiency
    of the McPhee Reservoir (97%), due to water losses as seepage and evaporation.
    Many researchers have investigated the relationship between yield and crop water
    use. The dry bean has been found to be sensitive to water stress. Singh (1995)
    reported that water stress during flowering and grain filling reduced seed yield
    and seed weight, and advanced the maturity of the dry bean. Irrigation efficiency
    is an issue in southwestern Colorado due to the salinity problems associated with
    irrigated agriculture and their impact on crop production. The dry bean is sensitive
    to salinity and water availability. Several studies have examined the impact of
    soil moisture status on dry bean production. In a study conducted by Howe and
    Rhoades (1961), yields of dry bean varied by 1269 lb/acre when the number of furrow
    irrigations ranged from one to four. The water requirement for the dry bean is
    approximately 17 in. of water per season in southwestern Colorado (Schwartz et
    al., 1996). The low water use by the dry bean provides an opportunity to reduce
    over-irrigation, compared with other crops grown in southwestern Colorado. Therefore,
    increasing the acreage in dry bean and small grain production, and decreasing
    the acreage in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), would help avoid water shortages
    in dry years in the area. However, the production costs, market availability,
    and price dictate what crop farmers grow. Soil moisture affects nutrient availability
    to crops and their yield response. In studies by Miller and Burke (1983), it was
    found that dry bean yield increased linearly with the increase in water application
    rates. Also, Stegman and Olson (1976) on pinto bean found a linear relationship
    between yield and estimated water use. There have been numerous studies on bean
    response to soil moisture. Miller and Burke (1983), Pandey et al. (1984), and
    Turk et al. (1980) used the line source irrigation system developed by Hanks et
    al. (1976) to study the yield response of crops such as dry bean and cowpea [Vigna
    unguiculata (L.) Walp. subsp. unguiculata]. It was found that different grain
    legumes respond differently to irrigation variability. Also, it was found that
    yield increased with water applied up to 1.00ET. Nielsen and Nelson (1998) reported
    that black bean yields were most sensitive to water stress during the reproductive
    growth stage, and plant height and leaf area were most sensitive to water stress
    during the vegetative growth stage. The top five counties in dry bean production
    in Colorado are Yuma, Weld, Kit Carson, Montrose, and Dolores. In 1997, 135 000
    acres were planted with dry bean in Colorado under dry and irrigated conditions.
    A total of 100 000 acres are harvested under irrigation, with total production
    of 2 120 000 lb, and an average of 2120 lb/acre. In contrast, the total harvested
    nonirrigated acreage in dry bean production was 20 000 acres, with an average
    yield of 800 lb/acre (Colorado Department of Agriculture, 1998). However, this
    left 15 000 acres of the total planted acreage not harvested due to weather and
    other related conditions according to Colorado Agricultural Statistics Service
    (1999, personal conversation). In southwest Colorado, which includes several counties
    including Montrose and Dolores Counties, the total acreage in dry bean is 44 500
    acres, where 22 700 acres are under irrigation with an average yield of 2000 lb/acre
    (Colorado Department of Agriculture, 1998). The very large dry bean acreage in
    irrigation in this area of Colorado, in particular, would benefit from the optimization
    of irrigation rates. This should improve yield, and most importantly, reduces
    over-irrigation that contributes to deep-water percolation and its impact on dissolving
    the natural salt formation (Mancos Shale) into the Colorado River. The objective
    of this study was to determine the effect of five different irrigation rates on
    dry bean yield response and water use efficiency (ETWUE). Materials and Methods
    The study was conducted during the growing seasons of 1992 and 1994 at the Southwestern
    Colorado Research Center at Yellow Jacket. The soil on the site is Wetherill silty
    clay loam. The experiment consisted of five irrigation rates, which were replicated
    four times in a randomized complete block design. The treatments were 0.00, 0.33,
    0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of estimated ET. Individual plot size was 15 by 20 ft. Plots
    of different treatments in each replication were separated by a buffer zone 10-ft.
    wide and diked to contain the irrigation water and eliminate water runoff. Also,
    the same buffer zone (10 ft.) was established between replications for the same
    purpose. Soil moisture content was measured twice a week in the center of each
    plot by using a neutron probe (CPN model No. 5031) at depths of 6, 12, 24, 36,
    and 48 in. Irrigation water was applied by using a drip system. The irrigation
    system consisted of a 2 in. internal diameter polyethylene tube connected to the
    main irrigation line. A filter was installed in the main line to prevent sediment
    from blocking the emitters. Five 0.5 in. internal diameter, 120-ft. long, lateral
    tubes were connected perpendicular to the polyethylene tube at 30 in. spacing
    on the top of the furrow beds. The drip irrigation system was designed to deliver
    four different rates of water: 0.13, 0.26, 0.38, and 0.51 in./h at 15 PSI with
    a 20 in. space between the emitters. Irrigation scheduling was done with the SCHED
    program (Buchleiter et al., 1988) using data collected from the local weather
    station to estimate daily crop water use. The SCHED program estimates crop water
    use by using the modified Penman Equation (Jensen et al., 1971), along with polynomial
    functions to generate crop coefficients based on the fraction of time from planting
    to full cover and days after full cover (Duke, 1987). Irrigation was applied using
    the manageable allowable depletion, which refers to the acceptable soil moisture
    depletion (40–50% of available soil moisture) at different growth stages for the
    1.00ET treatment by using the water balance approach, which includes estimated
    ET, soil moisture change, precipitation, and drainage to determine irrigation
    amount. The following water balance relationship was used in determining the irrigation
    amount: where the terms on the left-hand side of the above equation represent
    the applied irrigation water (I), precipitation (P), and surface runoff (R). The
    sum of these three terms represents the net addition of water to the soil profile
    over a time period of interest. On the right hand side of the equation are estimated
    ET, drainage or deep percolation (D), and the water storage change (SW) of the
    soil profile. Each of the terms in the above equation represents water flows or
    storage changes over some arbitrary time intervals. All of the terms in the equation
    are positive except for D and SW, which may be either positive or negative depending
    on the direction of the water flow (upward or downward flow) (Jury et al., 1991).
    Surface runoff (R) was negligible due to control of the water application on each
    plot. Deep percolation (D) did not occur, based on soil moisture monitoring at
    4 to 5 ft depths, where no increase in soil moisture was found. The dry bean (cv.
    Bill Z) was planted at 84 000 seeds/acre on 7 June 1992 and 3 June 1994 with row
    spacing of 30 in. No N was applied in 1992, and 40 lb N/acre was applied in 1994
    based on soil test results. Three pounds per acre of Eptam (S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate)
    and 0.25 lb ai/acre of Treflan (trifluralin) were incorporated into the soil before
    planting. Plant samples for dry matter were taken at different growth stages by
    cutting plant shoots at the ground level (two rows by 5 ft.). Half of each plot
    was harvested for dry matter yield determination. An area of 5 by 20 ft (two rows
    by 20 ft) from each plot was harvested for seed yield and final biomass yield
    assessment. Table 1. Combined analysis of variance of total dry matter and seed

    Results and Discussion Seed yield and dry matter were affected by different rates
    of irrigation. Combined analysis of variance revealed a significant difference
    in yield between the 1992 and 1994 growing seasons (Table 1). The seed yield and
    dry matter means for 1992 were 2802 lb/acre and 4582 lb/acre, respectively, compared
    with 2356 lb/acre and 3970 lb/acre, respectively, in 1994. This may be attributed
    to the weather differences between the 2 yr (temperature and precipitation). The
    amount of precipitation in 1992 (7 June to 14 Sept.) was 7.6 in., and total growing
    degree days were 1617, compared with 5.0 in. and 1899 total growing degree days
    in 1994 (3 June to 29 Aug.). In 1994, there were 13 d from planting to harvest
    during which the maximum temperature was greater than or equal to 90°F., and none
    in 1992. Higher temperatures and high evaporative demands during the growing season
    may lower the bean seed yields (Nielsen and Nelson, 1998). Effect of Irrigation
    Rates on Yield and Dry Matter In 1992, the yield of dry bean was much greater
    than in 1994, especially for 0.00ET, 0.33ET, and 0.67ET treatments, where irrigation
    was limited. It seems that the cooler 1992 growing season contributed to higher
    yields compared with 1994 under limited irrigation (Nielsen and Nelson, 1998).
    Maximum seed yield was obtained in the cooler year (1992) at an irrigation rate
    equal to 0.67ET, while maximum biomass yield was obtained at irrigation rates
    1.00ET and 1.33ET. This may suggest that the irrigation scheduling program SCHED
    that has been used is overestimating crop water requirements for obtaining maximum
    seed yield in the cooler year, while it meets water requirements for maximum biomass
    yield in both years. In 1992, TDM, which included seeds and plant weight at the
    above-ground level, increased significantly as the irrigation rate increased up
    to 1.00ET. There was no significant response when the irrigation rate exceeded
    1.00ET (or 1.33ET). The seed yield was significantly increased as the irrigation
    rate increased to 0.67ET. Total water applied during the 1992 season, which included
    rainfall, was 9.1 in. at 0.67ET treatment (Table 2). Therefore, an increase in
    irrigation plus precipitation of over 0.67ET did not produce a significant increase
    in seed yield. It did, however, increase TDM significantly and delay maturity.
    In contrast, seed yield results from the 1994 season showed significant differences
    in yield response among all irrigation treatments (Table 2). Dry matter and seed
    yields were generally lower in 1994 than in 1992. Table 2. Dry bean dry matter

    multiple range test. Effect of Irrigation Rates on Water Use Efficiency Water
    use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and harvest index (HI)
    are summarized in Table 3. The relationships used to describe these functions
    are: (1) (2) (3) Where: SYi = irrigated seed yield TDMi = total irrigated above-ground
    dry matter SYdry = nonirrigated seed yield TDMdry= total nonirrigated above-ground
    dry matter Irrigation water use efficiency for TDM declined as the irrigation
    rate increased in 1992, whereas seed yield showed an increase in ETWUE up to 1.00ET.
    On the other hand, both TDM and seed yield water use efficiencies declined as
    the irrigation rate increased in 1994 (Table 3). Irrigation use efficiency for
    TDM was greater than that for seeds at all irrigation rates. In contrast, crop
    ETWUE decreased considerably for TDM and seeds during both years beyond the 1.00ET
    irrigation rate. This may be related to the small yield increase at 1.33ET, compared
    with lower application rates, and the possibility of deep-water percolation below
    the root zone. The impact of different irrigation treatments can be expressed
    in terms of HI. The ratio of seed yield to TDM did not show any significant difference
    between all treatments for either year, except for the 0.67ET treatment in 1992
    and the 0.00ET treatment in 1994. In general, the HI reflects that seed production
    was higher in 1992 than in 1994. Also, the HI shows that the irrigation treatment
    has significant impact on the seed:dry matter ratio compared with the nonirrigated
    treatment. Effect of Irrigation Treatments on Growth Response In general, irrigation
    treatments had a significant impact on seed yield and total dry matter in both
    1992 and 1994 (Table 2). Plants under limited irrigation (0.33ET), even below
    the water requirement (16–19 in.; Schwartz et al., 1996), showed a significant
    increase in dry matter and seed yield, when compared with the nonirrigated treatment
    (0.00ET) (Table 2). In general, seed yield and dry matter increased as the irrigation
    rate increased. However, an irrigation rate over 0.67ET did not contribute significantly
    to the increase of seed yield, where it did for TDM in 1992. The increase in TDM
    under higher rates of irrigation was consistent during 1992 and 1994 compared
    with seed yield, where a significant increase was observed only in the 1994 season
    (Table 2). Treatments 0.00ET, 0.33ET, and 0.67ET were harvested 7 d earlier than
    1.00ET, and 10 d earlier than 1.33ET. Therefore, greater irrigation rates may
    contribute to late maturity and considerable delay in harvest, and hence is a
    concern, where the possibility of early frost and rainfall exist. Table 3. Dry

    columns within year followed by the same letter are not significantly different
    at alpha = 0.05 as tested by Duncan multiple range test. Dry matter response during
    the growing season as a function of time for different irrigation treatments showed
    a nonlinear relationship (Fig. 1). Total dry matter significantly increased with
    increasing irrigation amounts (40–90 d after emergence). The impact of the 1.33ET
    irrigation rate on dry matter production during different times of the growing
    season showed a slight improvement in dry matter over 1.00ET, especially in the
    1994 season. However, dry matter for all treatments showed no significant difference
    until 40 d after emergence. Furthermore, field observations and plant inspections,
    where plant root samples from different irrigation treatments were dug out and
    inspected, revealed a shallower root system under greater irrigation rates, compared
    with limited or no irrigation. Effect of Irrigation Rates on Soil Moisture Extraction
    The depth of soil moisture extraction by the plant root system is directly related
    to the water availability in the soil profile. The soil moisture profile showed
    considerable differences among the irrigation treatments in both years (Fig. 2).
    Dryland and limited irrigation treatments (0.00ET and 0.33ET) showed deeper soil
    moisture depletion at harvest than the other treatments down to 24 in., compared
    with the high rates of irrigation. This may be attributed to a deeper root system
    that developed under dryland and limited irrigation treatments. Figure 2 shows
    no soil moisture change below 12 in. for the soil profile under the 1.00ET and
    1.33ET treatments compared with lower irrigation rates. In contrast, soil moisture
    content showed little change below 24 in. for the 0.33ET and 0.67ET treatments.
    Therefore, under dryland conditions, dry bean has the potential to extract moisture
    from the soil profile as deep as 24 in. as indicated by Schwartz et al. (1996),
    that the active rooting depth for the dry bean is between 24 to 36 in., where
    the majority of moisture is extracted from the top 18 in. It was also reported
    that roots developed to 30 to 36 in. extract water late in the season when the
    bean plant is nearly mature (Schwartz et al., 1996). Nielsen and Nelson (1998)
    found much deeper water extraction with black bean (6 ft) when evaporative demand
    was high and water supply was limited. The soil moisture profile under the over-irrigation
    treatment was almost at field capacity (4.5 in./ft) for 24 to 48 in. soil depths.
    This means any extra water, such as irrigation or precipitation, after the crop
    season, will have the potential for deep percolation, and consequently, could
    lead to nitrate and other soluble salts leaching to the groundwater. Figure 1
    Open in figure viewer Dry bean dry matter during 1992 and 1994 growing seasons
    under different irrigation rates. Conclusions Water use by dry bean under variable
    irrigation rates was affected by the water application rate. Optimum irrigation
    rates and weather conditions during 1992 led to higher seed yield and dry matter.
    Irrigation rates in both years had a significant impact on seed yield and TDM.
    Maximum seed yield was achieved at an irrigation rate equal to 0.67ET in the cooler
    year, while 1.00ET or greater rate was required to obtain maximum biomass yield
    in both years. Crop ETWUE and IWUE decreased considerably for TDM and seed yield
    during both years beyond the 1.00ET irrigation rate. However, both IWUE and ETWUE
    for dry matter was greater than those for seed yield for all irrigation rates.
    Variable irrigation rates showed a significant effect on the HI (seed:dry matter
    ratio) compared with dryland treatments. Observations of the plant roots confirmed
    that a shallower root system was developed under high irrigation rates, compared
    with dry and limited irrigation treatments. The soil moisture extraction by the
    roots appeared to be primarily at the top 12 in. of the soil profile for high
    irrigation rate treatments, compared with 24 in. under dry and limited irrigation
    treatments, especially in 1992. The soil moisture profile was at or near field
    capacity under the over-irrigated treatments (1.33ET) after harvest, which could
    lead to the potential of deep water percolation and leaching of nitrate and other
    soluble salts. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Soil water content characteristic

    189 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract [1] Over the last 4 decades the use of blue
    water has received increasing attention in water resources research, but little
    attention has been paid to the quantification of green water in food production
    and food trade. In this paper, we estimate both the blue and green water components
    of consumptive water use (CWU) for a wide range of agricultural crops, including
    seven cereal crops, cassava, cotton, groundnuts, potatoes, pulses, rapeseed, soybeans,
    sugar beets, sugarcane, and sunflower, with a spatial resolution of 30 arc min
    on the land surface. The results show that the global CWU of these crops amounted
    to 3823 km3 a−1 for the period 1998–2002. More than 80% of this amount was from
    green water. Around 94% of the world crop-related virtual water trade has its
    origin in green water, which generally constitutes a low-opportunity cost of green
    water as opposed to blue water. High levels of net virtual water import (NVWI)
    generally occur in countries with low CWU on a per capita basis, where a virtual
    water strategy is an attractive water management option to compensate for domestic
    water shortage for food production. NVWI is constrained by income; low-income
    countries generally have a low level of NVWI. Strengthening low-income countries
    economically will allow them to develop a virtual water strategy to mitigate malnutrition
    of their people. 1. Introduction [2] Global water withdrawals have almost doubled
    over the past 40 years [Gleick, 2003a]. To increase food production, the irrigated
    area has been expended from 138 million ha in 1961 to 277 million ha in 2003 [Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2006]. In the coming
    decades, water uses will continue to increase as a result of demographic and economic
    growth [Rosegrant and Ringler, 2000]. [3] Understanding the geographic distribution
    of both water resources and agriculture water requirements allows the prediction
    of future trends in agricultural production and trade. Several efforts have been
    made to sketch global patterns of water use for agriculture and other sectors
    such as industry, urban and rural domestic water supply (Table 1). Despite the
    progress made in these water use assessments, studies either lack spatial details
    or are limited to blue water uses, or focus on water withdrawal while ignoring
    consumptive water uses. In addition these assessments are generally conducted
    at national or regional level, thus disguising the spatial distribution of supply
    and demand within a country or region. Finer spatial resolution is necessary,
    especially for large countries such as China and the USA comprising a range of
    different climatic conditions. Table 1. Important Studies on Global Water Use

    other country is treated as one simulation unit. d There is no separation between
    green and blue water use. [4] Water resources can be divided into green and blue
    water. The concept of green water was first introduced by Falkenmark [1995] referring
    to the total crop evaporation during crop growth. Later, green water resource
    has been generally used to refer to the water that comes from precipitation, is
    stored in the soil, and subsequently fed back to the atmosphere [Falkenmark and
    Rockström, 2006; Savenije, 2000] through crop evaporation. In contrast, blue water
    refers to the water in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, ponds and aquifers [Rockström,
    1999]. Both green and blue water resources are important for food production.
    Rain-fed agriculture uses green water only, while irrigated agriculture uses both
    green and blue water. Without considering green water, water use assessments are
    incomplete. [5] Consumptive water use (CWU) here is consistent with the term used
    by Falkenmark and Lannerstad [2005]. It has the same meaning as another term “water
    depletion” (the water use or removal from a water basin that renders it unavailable
    for further use) defined by Molden [1997]. For crop production, CWU refers to
    the total evaporative use of a crop during the crop growth period, often termed
    “evapotranspiration.” Here the term total crop evaporation is used in agreement
    with Savenije [2004]. It needs to be pointed out that CWU is different from the
    term “water consumption” defined by Gleick [2003b], which refers to the water
    withdrawn from a source and made unusable for reuse in the same water basin. [6]
    In many water scarce countries, an increasing amount of food is imported to meet
    domestic food demand [Yang et al., 2006]. For these countries, importing food
    is equivalent to importing virtual water to mitigate the physical lack of water
    for domestic food production. Virtual water is defined as the volume of water
    required to produce a commodity or service. The concept was introduced by Allan
    in the early 1990s [Allan, 1994] when studying the option of importing food (defined
    as virtual water) as opposed to liquid water to partly solve the water scarcity
    problems in the Middle East. Through food trade, the water used in exporting countries
    becomes virtual water in importing countries [Oki and Kanae, 2004]. With population
    growth and economic development, water resources are under pressure in an increasing
    number of countries. Unraveling the relationship between a country''s CWU and
    virtual water trade can improve the understanding of water-food-trade relationship,
    and help formulate appropriate policies to deal with water scarcity. So far, this
    relationship has not been systematically analyzed. [7] In this paper, we quantify
    CWU in food production and investigate CWU-virtual water trade relations. CWU
    at the global level is assessed with a spatial resolution of 30 arc min (about
    50 km × 50 km in each grid near the equator). Special attention is given to the
    green water component of CWU for the production of 17 major crops. Virtual water
    trade is quantified for each crop and is summed up as a common yardstick in investigating
    CWU-virtual water trade relations. On the basis of the CWU and the quantity of
    virtual water trade, we calculate the green water proportion in both domestic
    crop production and virtual water trade, and examine the virtual water trade and
    CWU for low-, middle- and high-income countries. 2. Methods and Data 2.1. Calculation
    of Crop Yield, Evaporation, and Crop Water Productivity [8] A GEPIC model has
    been used to simulate crop yield, total evaporation (E), and crop water productivity
    (CWP) for individual crops in each grid cell at the spatial resolution of 30 arc
    min covering the entire world. The GEPIC model is a GIS-based EPIC model designed
    to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the major processes of the soil-crop-atmosphere-management
    system [Liu et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008]. Crop yield is estimated by multiplying
    the aboveground biomass at maturity with a water stress adjusted harvested index
    [Williams et al., 1989]. Reference crop evaporation is calculated with a Hargreaves
    method [Hargreaves and Samani, 1985]. Potential crop transpiration is calculated
    by considering reference crop evaporation and a leaf area index, while potential
    soil water evaporation is simulated by considering reference crop evaporation
    and a soil cover index. Potential crop transpiration is reduced to actual crop
    transpiration (Et) when soil water content is lower than a certain percentage
    of field capacity. Actual soil water evaporation is estimated on the basis of
    the top 0.2 m of soil and snow cover. The sum of crop transpiration (Et) and soil
    evaporation (Es) is the total evaporation E. The sum of Es and Et is often called
    evapotranspiration (ET). This term, commonly used in agricultural engineering,
    in fact stands for the total evaporation from crop growth, here indicated by the
    total evaporation E [Savenije, 2004]. Detailed description of the GEPIC model
    can be found in work by Liu [2009] and Liu et al. [2007b], while the EPIC model
    is described by Williams et al. [1989]. 2.2. Consumptive Water Use at the Grid
    and National Level [9] The product of crop harvested area A and total evaporation
    E during a crop growing period is defined as consumptive water use (CWU). CWU
    in each grid cell is calculated as where CWU[i] is the consumptive water use in
    a grid cell i (m3 a−1). E0 and E1 are evaporation (mm a−1) under rain-fed and
    irrigated conditions, respectively. A0 and A1 are harvested area (m2) under rain-fed
    and irrigated conditions, respectively, and p is crop code. The constant 10 is
    used to convert mm a−1 into m3 ha−1 a−1. N is the number of crops considered.
    In this paper, we selected 16 individual crops (barley, cassava, cotton, groundnuts,
    maize, millet, potatoes, rapeseed, rice, rye, sorghum, soybeans, sugarcane, sugar
    beets, sunflower, and wheat) and one crop category (pulses). For convenience,
    we call these crops and the crop category “17 major crops.” Hence, N = 17 in this
    paper. The selection of the crops is based on the importance of crop commodities
    and the availability of data. The 17 major crops account for 63% of the total
    cropland area [Ramankutty et al., 2008], and about three quarters of the total
    global crop production over the period 1998–2002 (FAO statistical databases, 2006,
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, available at http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx).
    The cereal crops included represent about 96% of the total global cereal harvested
    area and 98% of the total global cereal production (FAO statistical databases,
    http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). [10] For irrigated agriculture, flexible
    automatic irrigation is set to calculate irrigation depth with the following assumptions:
    the model schedules an irrigation event when biomass production in 1 day is less
    than 90% of its potential that could have been produced had sufficient water been
    available. Water is always readily available when crops need it. The water amount
    applied in each irrigation event aims at bringing soil moisture content to field
    capacity, but it is limited to the depth between 30 and 100 mm d−1; the interval
    between two neighboring irrigation events is always higher than 7 days. These
    assumptions are often used when exact irrigation schedules are not available [see
    Cavero et al., 1999]. At the national level, CWU in a country c is calculated
    as the sum of the CWU of all grid cells within this country. [11] Two issues need
    to be clarified here. First, since we focus on consumptive water use, water losses
    in delivery process are not included. Irrigation depth refers to water height
    added to the soil in the vicinity to crops. Second, the estimation of the consumptive
    blue water use does not take surface storage into account because automatic irrigation
    generally keeps soil moisture content not higher than field capacity. This means
    that the consumptive blue water use estimated refers only to the irrigation that
    goes into total crop evaporation. In reality, surface storage can be significant,
    especially for paddy rice. Because of lack of the relevant data, surface detention
    storage is not considered in this study. 2.3. Green Water Proportion of Consumptive
    Water Use [12] The part of CWU coming from precipitation is defined as the green
    water use, while the part stemming from irrigation is defined as blue water use.
    The green water proportion (in %) is calculated as the ratio of green water use
    to total CWU. [13] In rain-fed agricultural systems, green water is the only contributor
    to CWU. In irrigated agricultural systems, both green water and blue water contribute
    to CWU. In order to quantify the green water proportion of CWU in irrigated systems,
    two different soil water balances are performed for irrigated crops according
    to FAO [2005]. In the first soil water balance, it is assumed that soil does not
    receive any irrigation water. Seasonal evaporation computed with this assumption
    is referred to as E0. In the second soil water balance, it is assumed that soil
    receives sufficient irrigation. Seasonal evaporation computed with this assumption
    is referred to as E1. Green water proportion g1 of crop p under irrigated conditions
    in grid cell i is calculated as [14] When both rain-fed and irrigated systems
    are taken into account, green water proportion g in a grid cell i is calculated
    as The national average green water proportion g in country c is estimated as
    the ratio of total national annual green water use to the total national annual
    CWU: where g[c] is the green water proportion in country c. CWU[ic] and g[ic]
    are consumptive water use and green water proportion in grid cell ic, respectively.
    The subscript c indicates that grid i is located in country c. Ic is the total
    number of grids in country c. 2.4. Crop Water Productivity at the Grid and National
    Level [15] CWP in each grid cell is calculated as the ratio of crop yield to E.
    The national average CWP of crop p in country c is estimated as where CWP[p,c]
    is the national average CWP (in kg m−3) of crop p in country c. Y0[p, ic] and
    Y1[p, ic] are crop yield of crop p under rain-fed and irrigated conditions, respectively,
    in grid cell ic. All the other symbols have the same meaning as above. 2.5. Calculation
    of Net Virtual Water Import (NVWI) and Export (NVWE) [16] The net virtual water
    import in country c (NVWI[c] in m3 per capita per year) was calculated as where
    IMP[p,c] and EXP[p,c] are the annual imports and exports of crop p in country
    c (in kg a−1). For an importing country c, provided that the imported crop p is
    not produced domestically, the world average CWP for crop p is used. Pop[c] represents
    the population in country c. [17] When NVWI[c] has a positive sign, country c
    is a net importing country in respect to virtual water trade; the opposite sign
    indicates a net exporting country. In the net exporting countries, the total net
    virtual water export, NVWE[c], is calculated with the same procedure as to NVWI[c],
    but expressed as a negative quantity. 2.6. Data [18] The input data for the GEPIC
    model are summarized in Table 2. The crop distribution maps describe the total
    harvested area of each of the primary crops on a grid basis. The data on the harvested
    area of the primary crops for the year 2000 are obtained from the Center for Sustainability
    and the Global Environment (SAGE) of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, USA
    [Ramankutty et al., 2008]. The data on the harvested area of the irrigated crops
    for the period 1998–2002 are taken from the Institute of Physical Geography of
    the University of Frankfurt (Main), Germany [Portmann et al., 2008]. Both data
    sets are available with a spatial resolution of 30 arc min. In this study, the
    harvested area of the rain-fed crops in each grid cell is the difference between
    the total harvested area and the harvested area of the irrigated crops. This value
    cannot become negative. To our best knowledge, these maps are the most recent,
    and most detailed available data sets for land uses for the different crop types.

    [19] The SAGE data are consistent with the statistical data from the Food and
    Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO). For example, the harvested
    area of wheat is 209 million ha from SAGE and 212 million ha from FAO in 2000.
    For rice, the harvested area is 153 and 154 million ha from SAGE and FAO, respectively.
    The maps from Portmann et al. [2008] are currently the only source that provides
    high spatial resolution and crop-specific irrigated area at the global level.
    The maps are generated on the basis of the global map of irrigated area (GMIA)
    from FAO [Siebert et al., 2007] (the latest version, 4.0.1). Hence, they are consistent
    with the GMIA, which is so far the most commonly referenced irrigation map in
    global water use assessments. [20] The amount of fertilizer applied per country
    and crop is derived from the statistical report by the International Fertilizer
    Industry Association (IFA), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC),
    the International Potash Institute (IPI), the Phosphate and Potash Institute (PPI),
    and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) [International
    Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), 2002]. The report provides the information
    on crop-specific application rate of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5), and potash
    (K2O) for major crops (including the 17 major crops) in 88 countries. These countries
    consumed around 94% of the total world fertilizer in 2000 (FAO statistical databases,
    http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). This data set only provides data for one
    specific year within the range from 1995 to 2001. Another source of fertilizer
    data is FAO, which reports the annual consumption rate of N, P2O5, and K2O from
    1961 to 2004 (FAO statistical databases, http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx).
    By assuming the fertilizer application rate by a certain crop from IFA [2002]
    is proportional to the annual consumption rate from FAO statistical databases
    http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx), the application rate of fertilizer for each
    crop was estimated for individual years, and was used in the GEPIC model. [21]
    Historical monthly data on maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation
    and number of wet days between 1998 and 2002 are obtained with a spatial resolution
    of 30 arc min from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia
    (CRU TS2.1) [Mitchell and Jones, 2005]. A monthly to daily weather converter (MODAWEC)
    model is used to generate the daily weather data [Liu et al., 2009]. Soil parameters
    of soil depth, percent sand and silt, bulk density, pH, organic carbon content
    are taken from Batjes [2006]. Soil parameters are available for 5 soil layers
    (0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, 80–100 cm). The simulation resolution in this study
    is 30 arc min. All the data sets with different spatial resolution were first
    converted into the simulation resolution of 30 arc min [Liu et al., 2007b]. Domestic
    crop production, imports and exports over the period of 1998–2002 were collected
    from FAO statistical database http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). High-, middle-
    and low-income countries were identified on the basis of the classification from
    World Bank [2005]. 2.7. Validation of the Model [22] Because of the lack of statistical
    yield on high spatial resolution, we aggregated the simulated 30 arc min crop
    yield into national averages and compared them with the national statistical yields
    from FAOSTAT. This validation method is the same as used by Liu et al. [2007b].
    The simulated and statistical yields are quite comparable though with more or
    less scattering depending on the crop (Figure 1). To further the validation, we
    followed Liu et al. [2007b] and used several statistical indices (see Table 3).
    The results show the normalized mean square error (NMSE) values are all lower
    than 0.4. According to the criterion of NMSE [Hanna, 1988], the model performed
    well for all the crops. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (EF) and R2 indices showed
    that pulses were not simulated as well as other crops. This may be caused by the
    fact that pulses are a group of crops, and we used peas as a proxy for all pulses.

    Distribution of CWU [23] The spatial distribution of CWU is shown in Figure 2.
    The highest CWU per grid cell (e.g., >300 million m3 a−1) was found in most part
    of India, in the river basins of the Yellow River, the Huai River, the Hai River,
    and the Yangtze in China, in the Mississippi river basin in North America, and
    some part of the Parana and Sao Francisco river basins in South America (Figure
    2). These regions mainly contained grid cells with a high fraction of arable lands
    and permanent crops [Ramankutty et al., 2008]. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Spatial distribution of consumptive water use (CWU) for crop production
    per grid cell of 30 arc min (average over 1998–2002). [24] The global annual average
    CWU was estimated to be 3823 km3 a−1 for the period 1998–2002. Of the global CWU,
    over two thirds can be attributed to cereal crops (Figure 3). Wheat and rice account
    for two thirds of the CWU of cereal crops. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Global consumptive water use for individual crops (average over 1998–2002). [25]
    Earlier studies estimated that the global CWU ranged from 2285 to 5500 km3 a−1
    in croplands [Postel et al., 1996; Shiklomanov, 2000]. Zehnder [1997] estimated
    for the period 1992 to 1994 a global annual CWU of 3536 km3 a−1. In this number
    vegetables and fruits are not included, but meat production and preharvested and
    postharvested loss are part of the total. Recent studies used a finer “crop” and
    spatial resolution, and global CWU was calculated on the basis of crop production
    of individual crops in different climate zones or individual countries. Rockström
    et al. [1999] estimated global CWU for agricultural food production on the basis
    of individual crop production for the period 1992–1996 in temperate and tropical
    climate zones. The ranges of crop water productivity in both climate zones were
    collected for different crops from published materials. A total CWU of 6800 km3
    a−1 was estimated for all the crops, of which 3515 km3 a−1 was for the 17 major
    crops studied here. The remaining of 3285 km3 a−1 was mostly for forage, oil palm,
    natural rubber/gums, fruits and vegetables, and cereals and roots/tubers not included
    in this study. The study of Rockström covered a period 6 years before ours. For
    comparison, it was necessary to adjust his data to the same period. The adjustment
    method was rather straightforward. For the annual production, the rates of 1998–2002
    were applied, while the CWP values used by Rockström et al. [1999] were unchanged.
    The thus adjusted average CWU for the 17 major crops became 3677 km3 a−1 (with
    a range of CWU between 2529 and 5554 km3 a−1), very close to our estimate. Chapagain
    and Hoekstra [2004] calculated the CWU for 164 crops on the basis of national
    average crop production and national average CWP for the period 1997–2001 [Chapagain
    and Hoekstra, 2004]. The CWU for all the crops was 6390 km3 a−1, among which about
    70% (or 4482 km3 a−1) was for the 17 major crops investigated here. Because the
    study period was close to ours, no adjustments were needed. The 4482 km3 a−1 is
    17% higher than our estimate. The higher value is mainly due to the overestimation
    of the consumptive water use for rice production in their study, a point we would
    like to address below. During the publication of this article, we realize that
    Rost et al. [2008] recently published their work on the estimation of global green
    and blue water uses with a high spatial resolution of 30 arc min. They calculate
    CWU of over 7200 km3 in cropland. Since the CWU for each crop is not explicitly
    included, the CWU of the 17 major crops is not calculated here for comparison.
    [26] Although the overall CWU of our study compares well with others, differences
    are significant in the values for maize, rice and soybean in the case of Rockström
    et al. [1999], and for rice, soybean and pulses in the case of Chapagain and Hoekstra
    [2004] (Figure 4). Our world average CWP is 2.190 kg m−3 for maize. This number
    is close to the world average of 1.800 kg m−3 reported by Zwart and Bastiaanssen
    [2004], who estimated this number from 27 reports not older than 25 years. Rockström
    reports a range between 0.687 and 1.066 kg m−3 and Chapagain and Hoekstra estimates
    a value of 1.100 kg m−3. Both values are below the world average of CWP reported
    by Zwart and Bastiaanssen [2004]. Chapagain and Hoekstra calculated CWP for rice
    of 0.45 kg m−3, much lower than the values from Zwart and Bastiaanssen (1.090
    kg m−3) and the present study (0.60 kg m−3). For soybean and pulses, the lack
    of information makes a comparison with other studies not possible. Figure 4 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of global consumptive water use for 17
    major crops. [27] Despite a rather high agreement of our data with other studies,
    we believe our estimations to be on the conservative side. The FAO statistics
    on crop production only include the quantities of commodities sold in the market
    and the quantities consumed or used by the producers. They do not include preharvested
    and postharvested losses and parts of crop not harvested for any reason (FAO statistical
    databases, http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). These losses might consume more
    than 20% of the CWU on the field [Rockström et al., 1999]. Some estimates go to
    values as high as 40% [Zehnder, 1997]. 3.2. Spatial Distribution of Consumptive
    “Green” and “Blue” Water Use [28] Green water accounts for the main part of CWU
    (Figure 5). In Africa, South America, Europe and Oceania, green water constitutes
    more than 95% of CWU in most grids. Grids with low green water proportion are
    mainly found western part of the USA, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Pakistan,
    Iran, Afghanistan, in the eastern part of China, and some part of India. Those
    regions are the largest areas with high irrigation density [Döll and Siebert,
    2000]. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distribution of green
    water proportion in consumptive water use for crop production. [29] On global
    average, green water accounts for 81% of CWU. This is close to the estimate of
    75% reported by Postel et al. [1996], who calculated the CWU in cultivated land
    by dividing the co-opted net primary production (NPP) by the global average biomass
    produced per cubic meter of water. The same authors estimated the total consumptive
    blue water use by multiplying the total irrigation by an assumed ratio of consumption
    to withdrawal. The very high irrigation application rate assumed by Postel et
    al. [1996] (i.e., 1200 mm a−1 in agricultural land) is a very important reason
    for the lower value of green water proportion estimated. Rost et al. [2008] estimated
    that 85% of the CWU in cropland is from green water when the contribution of nonrenewable
    and nonlocal blue water to irrigation is considered. This is an estimate close
    to ours here. [30] For most crops, green water accounts for more than two thirds
    of the consumptive water use except for cotton (Figure 6). Cotton has the green
    water proportion of 56%, the lowest among all crops. This proportion closes to
    the value of 48% reported by Chapagain et al. [2006]. Globally, about 73% of the
    global cotton production is from irrigated fields [Soth et al., 1999]. The main
    cotton producers are arid regions such as Egypt, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and northwest
    China [Chapagain et al., 2006]. Rice has a green water proportion of 67%, which
    represents the lowest green water proportion next to cotton. Cassava is a highly
    drought tolerant crop, and thus is less dependent on irrigation [Santisopasri
    et al., 2001]. With almost 100%, it has the highest green water proportion of
    all crops. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Global average green water
    proportion for individual crops. [31] At the national levels, over 80% of agricultural
    production depends on green water (Figure 7). In Canada, Brazil, Argentina, many
    African and European countries, and Australia, no less than 90% of CWU has its
    origin in green water. Arid and warm zones such as many countries in the MENA
    region show a low green water proportion. About 80% of the MENA region has annual
    rainfalls of less than 100 mm a−1 [Mubarak, 1998]. The lack of rainfall coupled
    with high evaporation makes irrigation crucially important for agriculture production.
    China has a green water proportion of 68%. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Green water proportion at the national level. [32] According to our calculations,
    consumptive “blue” water use (CBWU) was 720 km3 a−1 for the production of the
    selected crops. The 17 crops accounted for around 84% of the total global harvested
    area of irrigated crops [Portmann et al., 2008]. Assuming all the rest of crops
    have the same amount of irrigation per unit of harvested area as the average of
    the 17 crops considered in this study, we derive the global CBWU of 860 km3 a−1
    in cropland. Statistical data on global CBWU are not available, but can be roughly
    estimated. FAO [2008] provides national data on agricultural water withdrawal,
    and Rohwer et al. [2007] indicates irrigation efficiency for each country. Irrigation
    efficiency reflects the fraction of water diverted from a source for irrigation
    purposes and available for beneficial crop evapotranspiration. Hence, multiplying
    agricultural water withdrawal with irrigation efficiency and summing up these
    products for all the countries give global CBWU. In addition to irrigation, agricultural
    water withdrawal is also used for rural domestic purposes. Assuming 90% of agricultural
    water withdrawal is used for irrigation (this figure is set on the basis of the
    situation in China, which is 91% (China water resources bulletins, Ministry of
    Water Resources, available at http://www.mwr.gov.cn/)), global CBWU would be around
    830 km3 a−1, very close to our estimate. [33] It should be pointed out that our
    estimate of global CBWU is lower than the estimate by Döll and Siebert [2002].
    They estimated net irrigation requirement for rice and nonrice crops on the basis
    of a 0.5° digital global map of irrigated areas for the year 1995 (without crop-specific
    irrigation data) and long time series of monthly climatic variables. The world
    net irrigation requirement was estimated at 1092 km3 a−1. There are many reasons
    for the discrepancies between our estimate and Döll and Siebert''s, e.g., different
    data sets of irrigation maps, different representatives of crops, and different
    computer models. A direct comparison of computing results from both the studies
    is difficult because of these differences. Some other estimates are much larger
    than the estimates from this study and Döll and Siebert''s study. For example,
    Shiklomanov [2000] estimated the world CBWU as 1753 km3 a−1 on the basis of the
    irrigated areas in individual countries, while Postel et al. [1996] gave a value
    of 1870 km3 a−1 on the basis the world total irrigated area, average water application
    rate of 1200 mm a−1, and a ratio of consumption to withdrawal of 65%. These two
    estimates were based on national or global average data, and therefore were limited
    by low spatial resolution in estimation. 4. Sensitivity Analysis [34] Process-based
    crop models, like EPIC, are often sensitive to some parameters in the model. Wang
    et al. [2005] tested the sensitivity of crop yield to six most important parameters
    in the EPIC model: biomass-energy ratio (WA), harvested index (HI), potential
    heat units (PHU), water stress-harvested index (PARM(3)), SCS curve number index
    coefficient (PARM(42)), and difference of soil water contents at field capacity
    and wilting point (DIFFW). Maize yield was reported to be sensitive to DIFFW,
    WA, PHU and HI with a decreasing order, and it was barely sensitive to PARM(3)
    and PARM(42). We checked the sensitivity of CWU to these six parameters in the
    selected ten sites for wheat, maize and rice. In addition, the sensitivity to
    the water stress factor to trigger automatic irrigation (BIR) and N fertilizer
    application (N) was also analyzed here. BIR was first set as 0.9, which means
    that irrigation will be triggered when biomass production in a day is lower than
    90% of the potential biomass that could have been produced had water been available.
    The sensitivity analysis was carried out by altering the value of a single parameter
    or input by ±10%, while holding all others constant. [35] The results show that,
    in general, CWU was more sensitive to HI, WA and PHU, less sensitive to BIR and
    FER, and not sensitive to PARM(3), PARM(42) and DIFFW. For HI, WA and PHU, the
    sensitivity varied at different locations for various crops (Table 4). For instance,
    HI was the most sensitive parameter for the three crops in Tuanlin, Ludhiana,
    New Delhi, Bauru, Chartres, Midura and Vryburg. However, WA became the most sensitive
    one for maize in Florica and Bushland. For our simulation, sufficient water was
    always available when biomass production is below 90% of its potential. This assumption
    led to insensitivities of PARM(42) and DIFFW for CWU in our simulation. At the
    same time water-stressed HI was always larger than the lower limit of HI, resulting
    in an insensitivity of CWU to PARM(3). The findings of the sensitivity analysis
    are similar to those from Liu [2009], where a sensitivity analysis is conducted
    for maize, wheat and rice on a global scale with spatial resolution of 30 arc
    min. It is found that crop water productivity is more sensitive to HI, WA and
    PHU than other parameters. Table 4. Relative Percentage Change in CWU for Wheat,

    collecting spatially distributed crop parameters; that is, HI, WA, and PHU for
    improving the accuracy of crop growth models became obvious from our calculations.
    As far as we know, there are few efforts in collecting these data on a global
    scale. 5. Relations Between CWU and Virtual Water Trade 5.1. Net Virtual Water-Exporting
    Countries [37] Australia is with its almost 2500 m3 per capita per year the most
    important net virtual water-exporting country on a per capita basis. It is followed
    by Canada (2137) and Argentina (1372), and France, Paraguay, Hungary, the USA,
    and Denmark exporting between 350 and 900 m3 per capita per year (Figure 8). Figure
    8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship between net virtual water export
    (NVWE) and consumptive water use (CWU) in net exporting countries. [38] Green
    water accounts for 94.4% of the global virtual water export. It can be concluded
    that green water dominates global virtual water trade. Ten major virtual water-exporting
    countries (Figure 9) account for 94% of global total virtual water export. Interestingly,
    in the ten exporting countries, the proportions of green water in exports are
    generally higher than the proportions of green water in domestic production (except
    for Thailand). For instance, in the USA, green water accounts for almost 90% of
    NVWE. In this country''s CWU, the green water proportion is 83%. This is not surprising
    since green water rarely has competitive users, while blue water has several,
    e.g., industry and households. The opportunity cost of irrigation water is high.
    Exporting green water constitutes a low opportunity cost in water use as opposed
    to exporting blue water, holding other factors constant [Yang et al., 2006]. This
    can partly explain the higher proportion of green water in crop trade than in
    domestic crop production. The lower proportion of green water in exports in Thailand
    is mainly due to a large amount of rice exports. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Total net blue and green virtual water export in major exporting countries
    and green water proportion in total virtual water export (average over 1998–2002).
    Green water proportions are marked as percentage above individual countries. [39]
    CWU per capita increases when water is abundant and the climatic and pedological
    conditions are favorable. The result is a higher level of NVWE. Good examples
    are Australia, Canada and Argentina. NVWE becomes negligible with CWU below a
    level around 1000 m3 per capita per year (Figure 8). Such a level is logical,
    since each country has to first provide food to its own people. Zehnder et al.
    [2003] have already postulated the need of 1000 to 1300 m3 water per year to produce
    the food for one person for a diet comprising 20% meat. Haddadin [2003] presents
    the need of 614–1017 m3 water per year to meet the food diet in lower middle income
    countries. Of this water, 385–560 m3 is for vegetarian food. We estimated the
    CWU for crop production in developed countries because they constitute the main
    food exporters. Here, the average daily calorie intakes are about 3280 kcal per
    capita per year, with a meat proportion of 26% (FAO statistical databases, http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx).
    The vegetarian dietary water requirement is about 0.00041 m3 kcal−1 [Rockström,
    2003]. Thus, the caloric intake from vegetal products requires about 360 m3 (3280
    × 74% × 0.00041 × 365) of water per capita per year, if preharvested and postharvested
    losses are not taken into account. In fact, only a part of domestic crop supply
    is used for direct human diet consumption in developed countries. For instance,
    one third of the domestic cereal and starchy root supplies are currently used
    for direct human diet consumption, the rest are mainly fed to animals (FAO statistical
    databases, http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). This means that the amount of
    CWU to meet the total crop requirements for human diet consumption, animal feed
    and other purposes can be triple that of 360 m3, or 1080 m3 per capita per year.
    This number is close to the level below which NVWE becomes negligible. The level
    can be regarded as the CWU for meeting domestic crop food needs (both for human
    diet consumption or other purposes including animal feed) in the developed countries.
    These data do not include fully the preharvested and postharvested losses and
    the vegetable and fruit production, and are therefore relatively conservative
    estimates. 5.2. Net Virtual Water-Importing Countries [40] The Netherlands and
    Belgium are the two top net virtual water-importing countries on a per capita
    basis. Net virtual water import (NVWI) into the two countries is about 860 and
    650 m3 per capita per year, respectively (Figure 10). Both countries are big meat
    exporters with over 120 kg per capita per year of meat exports. A large amount
    of imported crop products is used as feed for livestock (FAO statistical databases,
    http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx). Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Relationship between net virtual water import (NVWI) and consumptive water use
    CWU in importing countries. [41] Israel and Jordan are the third and fourth biggest
    importing countries with a NVWI of over 500 m3 per capita per year. Both countries
    show a very low CWU of less than 50 m3 per capita per year. Their NVWI is to compensate
    for the lack of water, a fact which is seen in all the MENA countries. Besides
    the 17 crops, Israel is importing also substantial amounts of meat and dairy products,
    which almost doubles the NVWI calculated here [Yang and Zehnder, 2002b] [Yang
    et al., 2007]. [42] The CWU threshold above which NVWE becomes significant in
    net virtual water-exporting countries is much higher than the threshold below
    which NVWI becomes significant in net virtual water-importing countries. Net virtual
    water-exporting countries are mostly high- and middle-income countries. A large
    amount of crop products are used for animal feed. In contrast, there is a number
    of low-income net virtual water-importing countries. In the poor countries, crop
    imports may mostly be consumed to meet human''s diet requirements. For instance,
    in Zimbabwe, almost 90% of cereals were used for food, and only less than 3% of
    the cereals were used for animal feeds (FAO statistical databases, http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx).
    The consumption patterns of crop products in different countries may partly explain
    the difference of the thresholds. [43] Countries respond to CWU differently when
    CWU is below 250 m3 per capita per year. The results show that NVWI is affected
    by the levels of incomes. High- and middle-income countries generally have larger
    NVWI than low-income countries with a similar level of CWU (Figure 10). For example,
    CWU in Japan and Zambia is about 200 m3 per capita per year. The NVWI in Japan
    is over 300 m3 per capita per year, while it is negligible in Zambia. Apparently,
    the economic situation of a country is decisive with respect to the extent the
    world food market tapped to satisfy internal nutritional needs. [44] For some
    low-income countries, NVWI remains at a low level even with a low CWU. This means
    that part of the population is undernourished or obtains their calories from other
    sources than the 17 major crops. For instance, in Eritrea, the sum of CWU and
    NVWI is 261 m3 per capita per year. The calorie intakes from animal products and
    other vegetal foods are also low. In fact, this country is being confronted with
    serious food security problem and 73% of its population is undernourished (Table
    5). Mauritania has similar levels of CWU and NVWI to Eritrea. However, the undernourishment
    prevalence is much lower, largely because almost 50% of the calorie intakes are
    obtained from grazing animals and their products, and other vegetal products such
    as sugar, sweeteners, and vegetable oils. Another interesting case is Mongolia.
    Although both CWU and NVWI are very low, the food security situation is satisfactory
    at the national level. More than 40% of the calories intakes are from meat and
    other animal products from grazing herds. The rural areas rely even to a higher
    percentage on meat and animal products [FAO, 2006; FAO statistical databases,
    http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx]. Table 5. Daily Caloric Intake in Low-Incoming

    Remarks [45] This study made a first major effort in estimating explicitly green
    and blue water uses in crop production on a global scale on the basis of grid
    cell data. The results show that green water accounts for 81% of the CWU for crop
    production of 17 major crops. About 94% of the virtual water trade among countries
    has its origin in green water. Green water comes from rainfall; it is a “free
    gift” in terms of supply. This study shows that virtual water flows are often
    closely related to domestic water availability. Virtual water import is the most
    direct way to compensate for a lack of green or blue water, when the national
    economic situation permits it. High- and middle-income countries do already import
    virtual water at quite high CWU levels. The reasons can be many; for example,
    local production of certain crops is more expensive than importing them, or water
    is used for economically more attractive purposes. This later point can also apply
    to developing countries. Many water scarce countries have favorable climatic conditions
    for the production of high-value export crops. The economic gain from these agricultural
    products would allow satisfying the countries'' basic food need from the global
    food market, besides strengthening the national economy [Yang and Zehnder, 2002a].
    Two basic requirements have to be met if a country chooses to play the virtual
    water card. First, it must abandon or loosen up the principle of national food
    self-sufficiency, a step which even many industrialized countries will have difficulties
    to implement. Second, it requires an infrastructure to make best use of the profits
    from cash crop production. This requirement is difficult to fulfill in many poor
    countries [Yang and Zehnder, 2002a]. In any case, a better awareness of the role
    of green water in all its aspects can help countries to ease the water stress
    and economic difficulties linked to it. [46] In the past, water policies have
    been focused on the management of blue water resources. Massive blue water infrastructure,
    such as dams, aqueducts, and pipelines, has been constructed. In contrast, green
    water management in rain-fed agriculture has often been marginalized by water
    resources planners [Savenije, 2000]. Green water management helps the effective
    use of rainfall. By strengthening rainfall management, it is possible to double
    or even quadruple maize yields in sub-Saharan Africa [Rockström, 2003]. Rainwater
    harvesting is a promising approach for green water management in the semiarid
    tropics of Asia and Africa. Experiments with rainwater harvesting increased yield
    by a factor of 2 to 3 in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Niger, Sudan and Tanzania as compared
    to the current yield levels [FAO, 2000]. Additional spending in many of the rain-fed
    areas allowed more poor people to raise above the poverty line, than would be
    expected with investments in irrigation infrastructure [Rosegrant et al., 2002].
    Green water management is not only limited to “infrastructure” and management
    technologies. Biotechnological advances may also be helpful. For example, a hybrid
    “New Rice for Africa,” which was developed to grow in the uplands of West Africa,
    produces more than 50% more grain than current varieties when cultivated in traditional
    rain-fed systems without fertilizer [FAO, 2000]. [47] Finally, we would like to
    acknowledge the uncertainties existing in the estimations in green and blue water
    uses in crop production and the results based on them. Our estimations used the
    maps of irrigation areas for specific crops generated by Portmann et al. [2008]
    on the basis of the FAO''s GMIA. Total harvested area of the irrigated crops based
    on this source is about 312 million ha. This figure is smaller than the estimate
    in the global irrigated area map (GIAM) produced by the International Water Management
    Institute (IWMI). The GIAM from IWMI is generated with a great variety of remote
    sensed data at different geographical and time scales [Thenkabail et al., 2006].
    According to this source, the global total annualized irrigated area was about
    399 million ha. Hence, the global harvested area of irrigated crops from Portmann
    et al. [2008] is around 20% lower than that from IWMI. We compared the national
    irrigated area in 160 countries, where data are available for both sources. These
    countries account for 99.8% of the total global irrigated area. The discrepancies
    of the two sources are large for the countries with small irrigated areas. However,
    it is found that the higher global irrigated area from IWMI is mainly caused by
    the higher values for China, India and the USA, or the three largest countries
    in terms of irrigated area. The statistics of FAO are based on secondary statistics
    from its member countries, which may contain large errors. For example, some 60%
    of irrigation in India now is practiced using groundwater, most of which is privately
    developed and not necessarily recorded in governmental statistics [Thenkabail
    et al., 2006]. Thus, crop area under irrigation may be underestimated by FAO when
    private irrigation is taken into account [Faurès, 2007], so does the harvested
    area of irrigated crops from Portmann et al. [2008]. From this point of view,
    our findings may overestimate the green water proportion in the countries with
    a large amount of privately developed irrigation schemes, e.g., in India. Because
    of an absence of crop-specific irrigation areas in the IWMI irrigation map, we
    cannot use it to estimate CWU of the 17 crops in this study and hence cannot make
    comparison with the estimate on the basis of Portmann''s irrigation maps. On the
    other hand, we assume that irrigation is always readily available when crops need
    it. In regions with severe water scarcity, blue water uses are extremely competitive.
    Evidences have shown a reallocation of water uses from irrigation to domestic
    and industrial purposes [Yang and Zehnder, 2001]. The assumption of sufficient
    irrigation is likely to overestimate the blue water contribution, and underestimate
    the green water proportion in the water scarce regions. The extent to which the
    overestimation and underestimation are offset to each other remains unknown at
    this point. Comprehensive quality assessments of the harvested area of the irrigated
    crops and in situ measurement of irrigation depth are helpful for reducing the
    uncertainty in the estimates. Both issues need scientific attentions in the future
    research. Acknowledgments [48] This study was supported by the Swiss National

    drip irrigation (SDI) can substantially reduce the amount of irrigation water
    needed for corn production. However, corn yields need to be improved to offset
    the initial cost of drip installation. Air-injection is at least potentially applicable
    to the (SDI) system. However, the vertical stream of emitted air moving above
    the emitter outlet directly toward the surface creates a chimney effect, which
    should be avoided, and to ensure that there are adequate oxygen for root respiration.
    A field study was conducted in 2010 and 2011, to evaluate the effect of air-injection
    into the irrigation stream in SDI on the performance of corn. Experimental treatments
    were drip irrigation (DI), SDI, and SDI with air injection. The leaf area per
    plant with air injected was 1.477 and 1.0045 times greater in the aerated treatment
    than in DI and SDI, respectively. Grain filling was faster, and terminated earlier
    under air-injected drip system, than in DI. Root distribution, stem diameter,
    plant height and number of grains per plant were noticed to be higher under air
    injection than DI and SDI. Air injection had the highest water use efficiency
    (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in both growing seasons; with
    values of 1.442 and 1.096 in 2010 and 1.463 and 1.112 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE
    respectively. In comparison with DI and SDI, the air injection treatment achieved
    a significantly higher productivity through the two seasons. Yield increases due
    to air injection were 37.78% and 12.27% greater in 2010 and 38.46% and 12.5% in
    2011 compared to the DI and SDI treatments, respectively. Data from this study
    indicate that corn yield can be improved under SDI if the drip water is aerated.

    drip irrigationAir injectionCornWUE Introduction Modifying root zone environment
    by injecting air has continued to intrigue investigators. However, the cost of
    a single purpose, air-only injection system, separate from the irrigation system,
    detracts from the commercial attractiveness of the idea. With the acceptance of
    subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) by commercial growers, the air injection system
    is at least potentially applicable to the SDI system. Unfortunately, when air
    alone is supplied to the SDI system it emits as a vertical “stream,” moving above
    the emitter outlet directly to the soil surface. Consequently, the soil volume
    affected by air is probably limited to a chimney column directly above the emitter
    outlet. In this way, air and oxygen can continuously be supplied in solution and
    as micro bubbles, to root zone through the drip tape. Quite simply, subsurface
    drip irrigation (SDI) facilitates the delivery of aerated water directly to the
    root zone. This is defined as ‘‘oxygation.” It can potentially overcome problems
    associated with low oxygen in the rhizosphere as induced by flooding, by irrigation
    itself, by salinity, sodicity, and by compaction [1], [2], [3], [4]. The roots
    of most crop species need a good supply of oxygen in order to satisfy the water
    and nutrient needs of the shoots [5]. Paradoxically, one of the first symptoms
    of excessive soil wetness (i.e. saturation) is drought stress in the leaves. If
    these conditions are prolonged for more than a few days, then further serious
    damage can be affected via nutrient deficiency, build-up of metabolic poisons
    and increased incidence of root diseases [6]. Oxygen is essential for root respiration.
    Immediately after the roots have been surrounded by water they can no longer respire
    normally. The liquid also impedes diffusion of metabolites such as carbon dioxide
    and ethylene. This causes the plant to be stunted because ethylene is a growth
    inhibitor [7]. When air is entrained into the water within the root zone, diffusion
    of ethylene and carbon dioxide away from the roots may be increased. This increased
    diffusion rate should result in improved growing conditions. As drip irrigation
    develops a wetting front near emitters, the root zone of the crop remains near-saturation
    for a portion of the time between irrigation events, especially on heavy cracking
    clay (e.g. Vertisols) making them the least desirable soil types for drip irrigation.
    Particularly in poorly drained soils, flood irrigation and wet weather cause water
    to replace air in the soil thus reducing the availability and mobility of oxygen
    that remains trapped in soil pores [5]. By decreasing the supply of soil oxygen
    to plant roots, heavy rainfall or irrigation on such soils can constrain yields
    to well below their potential [8]. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) can significantly
    affect corn yields. For example increased with irrigation up to a point where
    irrigation became excessive; water use efficiency (WUE) increasing non-linearly
    with seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc) [9]. WUE was more sensitive to irrigation
    during the drier season and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) decreased sharply
    with irrigation. Irrigation significantly affected dry matter production and partitioning
    of the different corn plant components (grain, cob, and stover) [9]. Plant roots
    require adequate oxygen for root respiration as well as for sound metabolic function
    of the root and the whole plant. SDI minimizes alternate wetting and drying of
    the soil surface, a phenomenon that might otherwise predispose them to the cracking
    that could locally alleviate the lack of aeration. By direct injection of air
    in irrigation water, and by irrigation of a crop with aerated water, aeration
    of the crop root zone can now become a reality [1]. Injection of air alone is
    expensive and the injected air moves away from the root zone due to the chimney
    effect [3]. Oxygation is the delivery of aerated water by way of SDI systems [1],
    [2]. Aerated through a venturi principle, or with solutions of hydrogen peroxide,
    SDI provided yield benefits to a range of crops including cotton, zucchini and
    vegetable soybean [1], [2]. The reported studies on irrigation so far fail to
    offer an option for substantial reduction in water use while maintaining crop
    production. In a recent report on glasshouse and field experiments, [1], [2] confirmed
    that dramatic increases in crop yields, water use efficiency and salinity tolerance
    could be achieved with the use of oxygenated subsurface drip irrigation water,
    especially for crops grown on heavy clay soils [1], [2]. These researches showed
    that for soybean, oxygation increased water use efficiency (WUE) (yield divided
    by seasonal ET) by 54% and 70%, respectively, for hydrogen peroxide application
    and air injection using a venturi valve, and pod yield by 82% and 96%, respectively,
    for the two treatments. Likewise, for crops grown across a range of saline soil
    conditions, aeration using the venturi principle resulted in yields superior to
    those of the non-aerated controls [10]. Benefits of aeration using the venturi
    principle in California [3], [11], or using hydrogen peroxide in Germany [12]
    on crop growth have also reported. Aeration of subsurface drip irrigation water,
    using appropriate techniques such as the venturi, is a significant recent approach
    to economize on large-scale water usage and minimize drainage in irrigated agriculture
    [13]. Recent and ongoing research has shown that the incorporation of air injectors
    in SDI systems can increase root zone aeration and add value to grower investments
    in SDI. Accordingly the aim of this study was firstly to evaluate the technical
    feasibility of injection of ambient air into a subsurface drip irrigation tape,
    as a best management practice for improving growth characteristics and crop production
    of corn (Zea mays L.). Secondary to assess the effect of air injection on soil
    penetration resistance and plant take off force. Material and methods An open
    field experiment was carried out through installing an irrigation system that
    combined subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) tape and an air injection system that
    mixes air with the water delivered within the root zone. Location, soil, and crop
    details The experiment was carried out at Cairo University, Faculty of Agriculture,
    Agricultural Engineering Department experimental station at El-Giza governorate,
    Egypt (latitude 30.0861N, and longitude 31.2122E, and mean altitude 70 m above
    sea level). The corn variety Hybrid single 10 was directly sown on 22 April in
    both growing seasons 2010 and 2011. Plants were spaced 30 cm × 60 cm within and
    between rows, respectively. The experimental area has an arid climate with cool
    winters and hot dry summers. Table 1 summarizes the monthly mean climatic data
    for both growing seasons 2010 and 2011 for the city of El-Giza. Table 1. Monthly

    during the April–July growing season. The soil at the experimental site is classified
    as a sandy clay loam. Physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil
    are given in Table 2. Irrigation water was obtained from a deep well (60 m depth
    from the soil surface) located in the experimental area, with pH 7.2, and an average
    electrical conductivity of 0.83 dS m−1. Table 2. Physical and chemical soil properties

    the soil surface in a trench prepared with an AFT45 tractor mounted trencher (AFT
    Trenchers Ltd., Sudbury, England), laterals were placed at 60 cm between each
    other. Then the trenches were carefully backfilled with the previously removed
    soil. The lateral was 16 mm external diameter and 60 m long, the space between
    emitters was 20 cm, the emitter type was Supertif (Netafim, Israel), that were
    replicated three times in the experiment for each treatment. The emitter features
    were: 3.85 l h−1 flow rate, turbulent flow, completely flow regulated with outstanding
    clogging resistance, a working pressure of 100 kPa, and a built-in no-drain device
    which prevents water draining from the drip line when water has been shut off.
    Daily soil water balance and ETc were estimated with a computer software CropWat
    program. The inputs to the program were daily weather data, including rainfall,
    irrigation date and amounts, initial water content in the soil profile at crop
    emergence, and crop and site-specific information such as planting date, maturity
    date, soil parameters, maximum rooting depth. The CropWat program calculated daily
    ETc. This procedure calculates ETc as the product of the evapotranspiration of
    a grass reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). ETo was calculated using
    the weather data as input to the Penman–Monteith equation and the Kc was used
    to adjust the estimated ETo for the reference crop to that of other crops at different
    growth stages and growing environments. Air injection An air compressor and an
    air volume meter were used as the air-injector unit. They were installed in-line
    immediately after a gate valve. The air volume meter consisted of a 1 m length
    pipe with a diameter of 2 in., and was used to transform the flow from turbulent
    to laminar. An air velocity sensor was installed in the center of the pipe and
    was used to measure the average velocity (Fig. 1). This way it was possible to
    control the amount of air ingress into the irrigation line (12% air by volume
    of water). Aerated water was delivered to the soil through drippers. The water
    flow was decreased when air was injected and then we increased the time of irrigation
    to compensate for the decrement of water flow. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Hydraulic diagram of the microirrigation system, air injection unit, and

    using a profile probe calibrated by way of the gravimetric method. The time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) Profile Probe consists of a sealed polycarbonate rod (25 mm
    diameter), with electronic sensors (seen as pairs of stainless steel rings) arranged
    at fixed intervals along its length. Soil moisture was measured 5 cm away from
    the emitter by using the TDR sensor. Soil moisture was maintained between the
    refill point (28% by volume) and field capacity (41% by volume). Irrigation was
    carried out on a 1–3 day interval, between 7:00 h and 12:00 h, based on the readings
    from the TDR. Experimental design and treatments The experiment comprised of corn
    was grown at field capacity with and without aeration; three treatments were applied,
    drip irrigation (DI), subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and subsurface with air
    injection. The area for each treatment was 6 m * 60 m. The nutrient requirement
    of the crop in both experiments was supplied through fertigation using piston
    pump power by the water pressure system. Fertilizers consisted of 200 kg ha−1
    actual N, 50 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 60 kg ha−1 K2O. Starter fertilizer (10-50-10) was
    applied with the transplant water (500 g in 200 L water and approximately 116
    ml of solution per plant). Evaluation parameters The emitters were evaluated by
    way of the coefficient of manufacturing variation (CV), by measuring the discharge
    of a random sample of 20 emitters under different operating pressures (0.75, 1,
    and 2 kPa) using the following equations: (1) (2) where Xi is the discharge of
    an emitter, the mean discharge of emitters in the sample and S is the standard
    deviation of the discharge of the emitters in the sample and n is the number of
    emitters in the sample. According to the recommended classification of manufacturer’s
    coefficient of variation (CV) [14], the drippers were classified as excellent.
    The CV was 0.03 under 1 kPa operating pressure which represent the nominal pressure
    for the used emitters. The second parameter of evaluation was the water distribution
    uniformity. It was conducted through the catch cans test immediately after installation
    of irrigation system by digging the soil around the emitter and putting a catch
    can under it and collecting the emitted water for 20 min, this operation was repeated
    monthly through the growing season to check the distribution uniformity. It was
    performed in three replicates to evaluate how evenly water was distributed. Twenty
    cans were used to perform this test and were distributed randomly in the area
    under study. Using a stopwatch, the water discharged from each dripper in a period
    of 15 min was caught inside the can and the volume of water caught was measured.
    The discharge in l/h for each dripper was calculated. The distribution uniformity
    of low quarter was calculated according to Burt et al. [15]. (3) where DUlq is
    the distribution uniformity low quarter, dlq the lowest quarter depth (lowest
    25% of the observed depths) and davg is the average depth of the total elements
    (cans). The average of the DUlq for the three replicates was 95.61%. Data recording
    Weather data was recorded from an adjacent weather station. The center three rows
    of each plot were harvested, the grain yield per plot was calculated on a ‘‘wet-mass
    basis” (standard water content of 15.5%). Eight plants from each plot were also
    monitored and hand-harvested to determine growth and development parameters such
    as plant height, leaf area and stem diameter, and reproductive parameters such
    as days to flowering and grain filling duration. The data for leaf area, stem
    and root weight was derived from final plant harvest. Water-use efficiency (WUE)
    and irrigation water-use efficiency (IWUE) values were calculated were calculated
    with Eqs. (4), (5) [16]: (4) where WUE is the water use efficiency (t ha−1 mm),
    Ey the economical yield (t ha−1) and Et is the plant water consumption (mm). (5)
    where IWUE is the irrigation water use efficiency (t ha−1 mm), Ey the economical
    yield (t ha−1) and Ir is the amount of applied irrigation water (mm). Soil penetration
    resistance and plant take off force Penetration resistance was measured by nine
    insertions in each plot before planting, and at every 2 weeks throughout the growing
    seasons. It was conducted using a handheld cone penetrometer (Eijkelkamp – Agrisearch
    Equipment, Netherlands). A penetrologger was used with 11.28 mm cone diameter,
    30° angle and with vertical speeds that did not exceed 5 mm s−1 based on ASAE
    standard [17]. Penetrometer measurements were taken in X direction with 5 cm increments
    over the 0–50 cm depth, and at optimum soil moisture content (where the plowing
    can be performed). The plant take off force (the force needed to remove plants
    from the soil) was measured at harvesting where the soil was dry, by taking 10
    plants for each treatments and measurements were replicated three times in the
    experiment for each treatment. The take off force was conducted using a force
    gauge (Model M4-200, USA). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried
    out using the GLM (General Linear Model) procedure of the SPSS statistical package.
    The model was used for analyzing growth characteristics, WUE, and IWUE as fixed
    effects for the irrigation treatment and growing seasons and the double interactions
    between them, and the replications as the error term [18]. Results and discussion
    Plant populations for years 2010 and 2011 were approximately the same (55,556
    plants ha−1) because a planter was used and the rate of seeding was adjusted accurately.
    The crops were developed at a normal space each year. The first irrigation was
    made on 22 April of each year. The total irrigation water applied each year is
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. Yield, seasonal irrigation, water use, water use efficiency
    and irrigation water use efficiency for corn under different treatments for two
    growing seasons. Growing season Treatments Seasonal irrigation (m3 ha−1) Water

    Note: Numbers followed by different letters with in the growing season are statistically
    different (P < 0.05). The WUE did not differ significantly between the two growing
    seasons but it differed significantly between treatments; the WUE was significantly
    greater for the air injection treatment compared with the DI and SDI (Table 3).
    The IWUE followed the same trend. The cumulative water applied throughout the
    growing seasons was greater for DI for example at 12,970 m3 ha−1 in 2010 compared
    to the SDI and air injection. The air injection had the lowest cumulative applied
    water in 2010 at 11,503 m3 ha−1 (Table 3). The air injection had the highest WUE
    and IWUE on both growing seasons, it was 1.442 kg m−3 and 1.096 kg m−3 in 2010
    and 1.463 kg m−3 and 1.112 kg m−3 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE respectively in comparison
    with the DI treatment that had the lowest values of 0.928 kg m−3 and 0.937 kg
    m−3 in 2010 and 0.705 kg m−3 and 0.712 kg m−3 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE, respectively
    (Table 3). The effect of treatments on grain weight per ear was significant. Aeration
    increased grain weight per ear and length compared to the DI and SDI on both growing
    season (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The ear length for
    different treatments. The yield was significantly greater in both years for aeration
    compared to DI and SDI (Table 3). The yield of aerated treatment was higher than
    DI and SDI by 37.78% and 12.27% in 2010 and 38.46% and 12.5% in 2011. The grains
    weight per ear were significantly heavier due to aeration compared to DI and SDI
    79.8 g ear−1 versus 63.7 g ear−1 and 74.8 g ear−1 in 2010 for DI and SDI, respectively,
    while it was 80 g ear−1 versus 65 g ear−1 and 75 g ear−1 in 2011 for DI and SDI,
    respectively (Table 4). Table 4. Effect of DI, SDI and air injection on vegetative

    followed by different letters with in the growing season are statistically different
    (P < 0.05). Plant height increased with aeration and plants were significantly
    taller than DI and SDI 284 cm versus 260 cm and 265 cm in 2010 for DI and SDI,
    respectively, while it was 290 cm versus 265 cm and 270 cm in 2011 for DI and
    SDI, respectively (Table 4). A marked positive effect of aeration was observed
    on leaf area per plant where the air injection had the highest leaf area per plant
    with the lowest in DI treatment. Larger individual leaves was responsible 10,802
    cm2 versus 7312 cm2 and 10,754 cm2 in 2010 for DI and SDI, respectively, while
    it was 10,856 cm2 versus 7349 cm2 and 10,808 cm2 in 2011 for DI and SDI, respectively
    (Table 4). Stem diameter showed a positive response to aeration, there was a significant
    difference between air injection and both DI and SDI treatments. The air injection
    had the highest stem diameter followed by SDI and DI had the least values in both
    growing seasons (Table 4). The number of leaves per plant showed significant differences
    between the aeration treatment and both SDI and DI treatments. The leaf area per
    plant was 1.477 and 1.0045 times greater in the aeration treatment than in DI
    and SDI respectively (Table 4). The number of grains per plant was greater in
    the aerated treatment in comparison with DI and SDI (Table 4). With the air injection
    treatment, it was greater by 19.4% and 9.9% in 2010 and 20% and 10.2% in 2011
    compared to DI and SDI, respectively. The increase in 1000-grain weight by the
    air injection treatment over the DI treatment was 63.6% in 2010; and the increase
    in 2011 was 65.3%. The corresponding increase in 1000-grain weight for the air
    injection treatment over the SDI treatment was 7.4% in 2010; and in the 2011 was
    8.3%. This result matched those obtained by other researchers in the Unites States
    and Australia [1], [2], [3], [10], [12], who observed increases in yields, improvements
    in growth characteristics and in soil quality related to root zone aeration. Aeration
    had a slight effect on root length and width (Fig. 3); it increased the root dimensions
    in both horizontal and vertical axes related to when air was injected into the
    irrigation water. The aerated treatment had the greatest root length and width,
    followed by SDI, while the DI treatment had the smallest root dimensions (Fig.
    3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The root shape under different
    treatments. Cone index (soil penetration resistance) differed among DI, SDI and
    air injection treatments (Fig. 4). The maximum values of soil penetration resistance
    were 2.52 MPa, 2.00 MPa and 1.77 MPa for DI, SDI and air injection treatments
    respectively while the minimum values were 0.5 MPa, 0.17 MPa and 0.13 MPa respectively.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Relationship between penetration resistance
    and different irrigation treatment at the optimum soil moisture content. Because
    of the delicate nature of DI and SDI tapes, cultivation does not take place to
    depth, thereby predisposing the soil around the tapes to compaction. DI and SDI
    minimize alternate wetting and drying of the soil surface, a phenomenon that might
    otherwise predispose them to the cracking that could locally alleviate the lack
    of aeration that results in soil compaction and increases soil penetration resistance.
    With regard to the plant take off force (Fig. 5), the maximum value 98.7 kg was
    obtained under DI and the lowest value was 53.2 kg under air injection. The plant
    take off force decreased with air injection by about 80% and 22% comparing with
    DI and SDI, respectively. This suggests that under air injection the cohesion
    force between the root and soil is low, and that the adhesion force between the
    soil particles is low, so the take off force for plant is reduced with air injection.

    treatments at harvest. Conclusion Air injection irrigation systems can increase
    root zone aeration and add value to grower investments in SDI. The increase in
    yields and potential improvement in soil quality associated with the root zone
    aeration implies that the adoption of the SDI-air injection technology primarily
    as a tool for increasing corn productivity. The available indigenous materials
    can be used for aeration in different soil types and conditions in order to increase
    the returns on corn production. The cultivation technique developed in this study
    can be applied to other vegetable and field crops as well as corn and can be utilized
    even in wet lowlands otherwise considered as wastelands. In addition to yield,
    growth characteristics, plant take off force and soil penetration resistance,
    future studies should focus on the impact of air injection on soil respiration,
    soil salinity, soil microbial activity and insect/pest resistance. References

    Media Tables Share Abstract A system has been developed in Nebraska to automatically
    collect hourly weather data from remote agricultural weather stations. Standard
    weather sensors are coupled to an on‐site microprocessor. A central minicomputer
    regularly interrogates the microprocessor, quality‐checks the incoming weather
    data and transfers it to a larger mainframe computer. Weather‐data‐based programs
    are available to users of the mainframe computer through the AGNET system (a management
    tool for agriculture). Programs are currently available for such applications
    as irrigation scheduling, estimating energy requirements for grain drying, predicting
    stage and rate of crop development and predicting livestock weight gains. Nebraska
    now has 17 stations and the number is increasing rapidly since initial costs are
    low, site requirements are simple, and maintenance is minimal. As a result, interest
    is increasing in the use of near‐real time weather data. Formats available You

    In 1986, two large weighing lysimeters, — one in a peach orchard and the other
    in a grape vineyard — were constructed at the UC Kearney Research and Extension
    Center as a joint effort between UC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture''s
    Water Management Laboratory. Hourly weight changes in the lysimeters have been
    used to measure the daily and seasonal water use of trees and vines for nearly
    20 years. Peaches and grapes exhibit similar seasonal crop-coefficient patterns
    that start as low as 0.1 in March, increase linearly until early July and then
    remain constant between 1.1 and 1.2 for the remainder of the season (provided
    the plants remain disease-, pest-and stress-free). The linear increase phase is
    proportional to the increase in canopy light-interception and leaf area. These
    relationships have facilitated modeling to predict crop evapotranspiration under
    various conditions. The peach lysimeter has also been useful for studying the
    effects of water stress on tree water use and for evaluating other methods of
    estimating water use. Full text Water is a critical resource in agriculture, and
    supplying the right amount is essential for healthy plants and optimum productivity.
    With insufficient water, plants become stressed and unproductive, and eventually
    die. With an excess, they can suffer from diseases, nutritional disorders and
    waterlogged soils. The most accurate way to estimate water use by crops is with
    a weighing lysimeter, which measures water loss from the plants and surrounding
    soil. A weighing lysimeter is simply a large “flower pot” resting on a sensitive,
    underground scale. Short-term weight loss from the system is almost entirely due
    to water transpired through leaves or evaporated from the soil surface. UC pomology
    specialist R. Scott Johnson, above, adjusts the balance beam in one of two lysimeters
    constructed at the UC Kearney Research and Extension Center. These rare research
    tools are large and expensive to maintain, which is why so few of them exist around
    the world. For 20 years they have been the most precise method of understanding
    daily and seasonal water use in the San Joaquin Valley. Every hour soil evaporation
    and plant transpiration — crop “evapotranspiration” — is recorded. When a threshold
    value is exceeded, the trees or vines growing in the lysimeters are automatically
    irrigated. While this technique is generally considered one of the most reliable
    because it is simple and direct (Aboukhaled et al. 1981), weighing lysimeters
    are expensive to install and maintain, so relatively few have been constructed
    around the world, especially to study perennial trees and vines. At the UC Kearney
    Research and Extension Center (KREC), we have had two of these instruments for
    nearly 20 years. They have been particularly useful for determining patterns of
    tree and vine crop coefficients, studying water-stress effects on water use, and
    evaluating other techniques for estimating water use. Lysimeter and field design
    In 1986, two large weighing lysimeters were constructed at KREC as a joint effort
    between UC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture''s Water Management Laboratory.
    Each lysimeter consists of an underground chamber that houses a balance-beam weighing
    system constructed by Fred Lourence (Precision Lysimeters, Red Bluff, Calif.)
    upon which rests a rectangular box measuring 6.5 feet wide by 13 feet long by
    6.5 feet deep (Phene et al. 1991; Williams et al. 2003b). In constructing the
    underground chamber, soil was removed in 6-inch increments so it could be replaced
    in the box at approximately the same depth as the surrounding soil. In spring
    1987, two peach trees were planted in one lysimeter and two grape vines were planted
    in the other, and in each case the surrounding 3 acres were planted to the same
    variety and spacing. The grape variety was ‘Thompson Seedless’ (clone 2A) with
    7-feet-by-11.5-feet spacing. The peach variety was initially ‘O’Henry’ (late-July
    harvest) on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock, with 6-feet-by-16-feet spacing. In 1997, the
    mature ‘O’Henry’ trees were removed from the lysimeter and surrounding orchard
    and replaced in 1999 with ‘Crimson Lady’ (late-May harvest) peaches, which were
    also on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock at the same spacing. Fig. 1. Hourly crop evapotranspiration
    (ET) on June 9, 1996, as measured by the Kearney grape and peach lysimeters. Reference
    ETo was obtained from a nearby CIMIS weather station. Each lysimeter has two separate
    irrigation systems, one below and the other above the ground. The underground
    irrigation systems are 12 inches and 24 inches deep in the peach lysimeter, and
    16 inches deep in the grape lysimeter. Each underground system has 1-gallon-per-hour
    (gal/hr) emitters every 12 inches on either side of the plants. The aboveground
    irrigation systems consist of a single in-row line on or above the soil surface.
    The grape lysimeter''s system is suspended 16 inches aboveground and has 1 gal/hr
    in-line drip emitters every 12 inches. The peach lysimeter''s aboveground system
    had a 3.5-foot-diameter circle of ten 0.5 gal/hr drip emitters every 12 inches
    around each tree when planted with ‘O’Henry’, and a single 26 gal/hr emitter that
    fills a 4-foot diameter basin around each tree when planted with ‘Crimson Lady’.
    Irrigation water is supplied by two 80-gallon polyethylene tanks suspended from
    and included in the total mass of the lysimeters. In addition, the lysimeters
    can control the low-volume irrigation systems in the surrounding fields. The vineyard
    is irrigated by a single line of drip tubing suspended 16 inches above the soil
    with 1 gal/hr in-line emitters every 12 inches. Each tree in the peach orchard
    has a 6.7 gal/hr spray emitter with about a 10-foot radius. The lysimeters have
    been in continuous operation since 1987. Every hour, the lysimeter boxes (including
    soil, plants and suspended irrigation tanks) are automatically weighed to determine
    water loss, which includes both soil evaporation and plant transpiration and is
    often referred to as “crop evapotranspiration,” or ETc. The values are recorded
    with a data logger (Campbell Scientific Instruments, 21 XL Micrologger, Logan,
    Utah) and the mass change is compared to a threshold value. When this value is
    exceeded, the trees or vines are automatically irrigated. Generally, low threshold
    values have been used so that multiple irrigations per day are called for in the
    summer. This maintains soil moisture content close to field capacity and minimizes
    any water stress effects. At midnight each day, the water tanks are automatically
    refilled to a preset level, and the new lysimeter mass is set as the baseline
    for the next day. Hourly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) values are calculated
    by a modified Penman equation using weather data collected from a nearby CIMIS
    (California Irrigation Management Information System) weather station. This equation
    was developed by scientists to estimate grass ET and is used as a standard around
    the world. Daily summed ETc values are divided by daily summed ETo to provide
    a crop coefficient (Kc) for each day. Once a seasonal pattern of crop coefficients
    has been established, this information can be used to guide irrigation amounts.
    The crop coefficient multiplied by ETo for a given time period gives an ETc value
    for that same period of time. Then, after adjusting for irrigation efficiency,
    the amount of water to apply can be determined. Fig. 2. Seasonal pattern of crop
    coefficients for mature grapevines (1996) and peach trees (average from 2001 to
    2003) as calculated from lysimeters. Each data point is a weekly average. Regression
    lines are for data collected from bud-break through early July (about day 180).
    Tree and vine crop coefficients During normal midsummer days in central California,
    with hot temperatures and cloudless skies, the lysimeters generate smooth daily
    ETc graphs with minimal noise (fig. 1). During periods of unsettled weather, the
    lysimeter output is more variable from one hour to the next, but has generally
    followed the same pattern as ETo, resulting in consistent day-to-day crop-coefficient
    values. The typical seasonal crop-coefficient pattern of mature plants for both
    peaches and grapes starts as low as 0.1 to 0.2 early in the spring and increases
    steadily until early July (fig. 2) (Ayars et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2003a).
    Grape is delayed somewhat compared to peach because it is more severely pruned
    and takes longer to develop its canopy. For the remainder of the season, the crop
    coefficients for both crops leveled off at values between 1.1 and 1.2. The seasonal
    pattern of young trees and vines has also been determined (Johnson et al. 2002;
    Williams et al. 2003b). The Kearney lysimeter research has elucidated factors
    affecting the water use of trees and vines, allowing for the better estimation
    of crop coefficients under conditions different from those in the lysimeter fields.
    One factor that has clearly been demonstrated is between canopy light interception
    and tree water use (Johnson et al. 2000), or leaf area and vine water use (Williams
    et al. 2003a). This relationship holds true for both young and mature trees and
    vines. The steadily increasing crop coefficients throughout the spring (fig. 2)
    are primarily due to the tree or vine''s expanding canopy and its increasing interception
    of light. Left and center, construction of the two large weighing lysimeters at
    KREC began in 1986. Each lysimeter consists of an underground chamber that houses
    a balance-beam weighing system with a rectangular “flower pot” measuring 6.5 feet
    wide by 13 feet long by 6.5 feet deep. Right, researchers enter the completed
    lysimeter. The Kearney peach lysimeter yielded a crop-coefficient pattern (Ayars
    et al. 2003) distinctly different from previously published values for deciduous
    fruit crops (Snyder et al. 1989). The published values, which were derived primarily
    from almond trees, start at about 0.5 in the spring and increase to peak values
    of less than 1.0. Thus, the lysimeter-derived peach crop-coefficient pattern starts
    much lower initially in the spring, but by midsummer reaches a higher plateau.
    These differences can be attributed to differences in the canopy development of
    peach and almond trees. Almonds are minimally pruned and quickly develop a spur
    canopy (many short shoots), which has high light-interception in the spring. In
    contrast, peach trees are more heavily pruned and require extensive shoot growth
    before they develop a full canopy. These differences indicate that separate crop-coefficient
    values may be needed for different deciduous fruit-tree species and grapevines,
    depending on pruning and canopy development parameters. The maximum midsummer
    crop-coefficient values of 1.1 to 1.2 are greater than those reported in the past
    for trees and vines. However, these values are not out of line with recent reports
    on a wide range of crop plants including beans, corn, cotton, sugar cane and pistachios
    (Allen et al. 1998). In addition, while other researchers have reported that crop
    coefficients decrease toward the end of the growing season (Williams et al. 2003a),
    these decreases were due to insect pest defoliation (Daane and Williams 2003)
    or irrigation cutoff (Ayars et al. 2003). Such late-season declines in crop coefficients
    were not observed in either lysimeter as long as the plants were kept healthy,
    free of pests and well watered. Therefore, even though there may be horticultural
    or pest management reasons for cutting back irrigation water at the end of the
    season, there does not appear to be a physiological basis for it. The Kearney
    lysimeter research has clearly demonstrated that as long as they are kept healthy,
    peach trees and grapevines are capable of using significant amounts of water throughout
    the growing season. However, it is important to emphasize that the lysimeters
    measure water use under conditions of high soil-water availability, which are
    not necessarily the best conditions for optimum production, tree health and fruit
    quality. A study in the grape lysimeter vineyard showed that yields were maximized
    when moderate water stress was imposed by limiting water applications throughout
    the season to between 60% and 80% of lysimeter water use (full ETc) (Williams
    2000). Likewise, there are many fruit-tree studies showing the benefits of imposing
    moderate water stress at different periods of the growing season. Ongoing research
    is needed to develop deficit-irrigation (less than full ETc) management strategies
    that optimize fruit quality, plant health and long-term productivity. To aid in
    irrigation management, a model to predict peach-tree water use has been developed
    using lysimeters to quantify the relationships among light interception, soil
    evaporation, tree dimensions and tree water use (Johnson et al. 2002, 2004). Water
    stress and water use The lysimeters have also been useful for evaluating how water
    stress affects various parameters, particularly water use. In 1996, the peach
    lysimeter was subjected to a 3-week drying cycle and during that time frequent
    measurements were made of soil water content, predawn leaf water-potential and
    midday stem water-potential (Mata et al. 1999). Water potential is measured with
    a pressure chamber and basically indicates the tension of water in the leaf. All
    three parameters showed strong correlations with tree water use. For soil water
    content, tree water use started to decline when the available water content decreased
    by 20% in the top 33 inches of soil, and then declined steadily as the water content
    continued to decrease. For predawn leaf water-potential and midday stem water-potential
    there was a continual decline in water use across all values, suggesting that
    either measurement could be useful in determining how well irrigation is supplying
    full crop ETc and in assessing tree water stress. Similar relationships have also
    been found for grapevines (Williams and Araujo 2002). A second study of more moderate
    water stress was conducted in the peach lysimeter in 2002. Three short-term drying
    cycles of about 1 week were imposed during 3-week periods in early June and again
    in late July. During each cycle, daily measurements were made of midday stem water-potential.
    As in the 1996 study, there was a linear decline in tree water use with decreasing
    midday stem water-potential values (fig. 3). Absolute water use was higher in
    late July than early June because of greater leaf area. However, the slope of
    the relationship was similar for both of these periods as well as during the 1996
    study, which suggests midday stem water-potential might be a consistent tool for
    irrigation management in peach trees. Indeed, this measurement has proven to be
    useful both for predicting water stress and for helping schedule irrigation for
    a range of tree and nut species in California (Shackel et al. 1997). Fig. 3. Relationship
    between peach tree crop-coefficient (Kc = ETc/ETo) and midday stem water-potential
    (MSWP) for two periods of three dry-down cycles (no irrigation for 5 to 7 days)
    in 2002. MSWP is expressed in units of mega-pascals (MPa), a measure of water
    tension in the plant. Methods for estimating water use Since a lysimeter is the
    most precise technique for measuring ETc, its output can be compared with that
    of other less expensive methods for validation. The peach lysimeter has shown
    that two such methods are inaccurate but that others may be promising. The two
    inaccurate methods are the heat balance technique for estimating sap flow (Shackel
    et al. 1992) and the use of leaf-to-air temperature differences, as measured by
    an infrared sensor to estimate stress (Medawar 1991). Promising methods, such
    as the measurement of stem water-potential mentioned above, also include the continuous
    monitoring of diurnal changes in trunk diameter (shrinking and swelling) as an
    irrigation guide (Fereres et al. 1999; Goldhamer et al. 2003). As more techniques
    for estimating water use are developed, such as those involving remote sensing
    or detailed meteorological data, the Kearney lysimeters will be valuable instruments
    for validation purposes. The Kearney lysimeters have been in constant use since
    1987. One lysimeter measures water use in peaches, top, the other ‘Thompson Seedless’
    grapes, bottom. The lysimeters have provided more accurate evapotranspiration
    values for peach trees and grape vines, information necessary in irrigation management
    decisions that ultimately affect plant health and fruit quality. Return to top

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    Get rights and content Abstract Green roofs can notably modify the thermal properties
    of the building envelope and adjacent air to bring environmental benefits. This
    study investigates the heat flux dynamics of the tropical green roof ecosystem
    to provide a scientific basis for design and management. Green roof experimental
    plots were established to monitor the total solar radiation, net radiation, and
    micrometeorological parameters. The data permit calculation of sensible and latent
    heat fluxes using the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. The results demonstrated
    the life cycle characteristics of heat flux components. The dynamic changes of
    sensible (H), latent (λE) and soil (G) heat fluxes were denoted by single-peak
    quadratic curves. Net radiation (Rn) was largely determined by quantity and variation
    trends of λE, reaching at 1300 h a maximum λE of 655 W m−2 and maximum H of 369
    W m−2. Temporal heat-flux fluctuations were strongly correlated with meteorological
    variables. Extreme values of H and λE correlated well with precipitation and temperature
    (R2 = 0.78). Dynamics of heat-flux magnitude and partitioning demonstrated notable
    differences by daily and season periods. They displayed considerable variations
    in flux partitioning, with Bowen ratios strongly correlated with weather conditions
    and vegetation types. The energy budget of the green roof ecosystem is unbalanced
    with a heat loss of about 15.5% caused by soil and canopy heat reserve. The passive
    indoor cooling effect under the green roof is attributed to the unbalanced energy
    closure. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Bowen ratioEnergy

    1. Introduction Green roofs contribute to environmental improvement and sustainable
    living, especially in compact cities (Gomez et al., 1998, Miyawaki, 1998, Niachou
    et al., 2001, Lazzarin et al., 2005, Santamouris et al., 2006, Alvarado and Martínez,
    2008, Miranville et al., 2008, Collins et al., 2009). Their environmental benefits
    are derived from functioning as living ecosystems. The cooling, shading and insulation
    afforded by green roofs can significantly limit heat flow into buildings (Del
    Barrio, 1998, Wong et al., 2003, Sailor et al., 2008, Teemusk and Mander, 2009,
    Teemusk and Mander, 2010). Green roofs reduce the heat transfer through the roof
    to reduce indoor heat gain and cooling energy consumption. The heat transfer processes
    of a flat roof, such as convection, conduction and radiation, are modified by
    the green roof through the thermal characteristics and surface properties of the
    constituent materials, evapotranspiration (ET) and metabolic processes of plants
    (Theodosiou, 2003, Koehler, 2004, Martens et al., 2008). Energy exchange and transmission
    of a green roof ecosystem are influenced by weather conditions, plant physiological
    functions, and building structures. Factors that regulate heat transfer include
    the external air temperature and humidity, direct solar radiation (clear sky or
    overcast), building materials, ratio of hard to vegetated surfaces, roofing material
    and color, soil depth, exposed soil color, soil water content, and vegetation
    type and coverage. For a green roof, the heat flux aspect of its energy balance
    is composed of three parts: sensible, latent and soil heat fluxes. Evaporation
    is an integral and pertinent part of the hydrothermal balance package (Ouyang
    and Haghighat, 1991, Grigoletti et al., 2008). The partitioning between latent
    and sensible heat fluxes is critical in determining the hydrological cycle, boundary
    layer development, and microclimatic conditions. Two key issues of flux partitioning
    are the variabilities of partitioning across different climates and ecosystems,
    and the mechanisms that induce such variabilities (Lindberg et al., 2004, Fang,
    2008). Energy partitioning at the surface is a complex function of interactions
    between plant physiology and development of the atmospheric boundary layer (Cellier
    and Olioso, 1993, Emilsson, 2008). Despite conceptual and practical complexities,
    it is important to understand the underlying factors and processes of energy flows
    and associated energy savings brought by green roofs (Fritschen and Simpson, 1989,
    Nichols, 1994, Cóstola et al., 2009). The methods for studying the energy balance
    of ecosystems are classified into three general types: heat balance method, hydrologic
    water evaporation method, and micrometeorology method. The heat balance method
    employs the principle of energy conservation to calculate heat transfers, and
    the convective heat flows are determined by heat transfer equation for surface
    and air temperatures (Lacroix, 1993, Malek and Bingham, 1997, Martens et al.,
    2008). The hydrologic water evaporation method is favored for monitoring the effect
    of long-term energetics due to vegetation changes. The micrometeorological method
    is often adopted in field control experiments (Geros et al., 1999). It employs
    the Penman–Monteith equation, Priestley–Taylor equation, Bowen ratio, and vapor
    gradient concept (Cellier and Olioso, 1993, Nichols, 1994). The Bowen ratio energy
    balance (BREB) method is widely used in micrometeorology study to estimate actual
    or potential ET. Compared with eddy covariance or water balance, BREB is fairly
    robust when Bowen ratios are mostly positive (Malek and Bingham, 1997). The BREB
    method estimates latent heat flux from a surface using measurements of air temperature
    and humidity gradients, net radiation, and soil heat flux (Fritschen and Simpson,
    1989). Despite its limitations in application experiments, the advantages of BREB
    are straight-forward and simple measurements in calculating heat fluxes. Moreover,
    it can estimate continuous heat fluxes at fine time scales (intervals of <1 h)
    and requires little information about surface aerodynamic characteristics. Previous
    studies provide valuable background on heat flux and energy balance of green roofs
    (Cellier and Olioso, 1993, Nichols, 1994, Del Barrio, 1998, Kumar and Kaushik,
    2005, Fang, 2008, Grigoletti et al., 2008, Martens et al., 2008). Most studies
    emphasized the engineering or horticultural aspects, and seldom treated green
    roof as an ecological system. The objective of this study is to investigate from
    the microclimatalogical perspective the dynamics of heat flux and energy balance
    of the green roof ecosystem. We designed field experiments to monitor the total
    solar radiation, net radiation, and micrometeorological parameters. The data were
    used to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes of the green roof with the
    help of the BREB method. We explored the effects of different vegetation covers
    on water absorption and thermal transmission under different field microclimatic
    regimes. The findings could provide a scientific basis to optimize the design
    and management of the green roof as an integrated ecosystem and as a natural passive
    cooling entity. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design and data acquisition
    The experiment was conducted on the roof of the Runme Shaw Building at the University
    of Hong Kong to establish a thermal reduction map of different scenarios. Fig.
    1, Fig. 2 illustrate the details of the experimental setup. It consisted of four
    8 m × 8 m plots, namely, a control and three vegetation types of different growth
    forms, plant height, leaf area and biomass structure. They included a shrub (Duranta
    repens, Golden Dewdrop), a perennial herbaceous groundcover (Arachis pintoi, Perennial
    Peanut), and a lawn grass (Zoysia tenuifolia, Korean Velvet Grass) (Table 1).
    The plots were retrofitted on the four-storied building, with a flat roof concrete
    slab protected by a waterproofing membrane, thermal insulation panels, screed
    and cement tiles. A proprietary multiple-layer green roof system (Nophadrain,
    Kirkrade, the Netherlands) was laid directly on the tile surface with a 2% gradient
    to shed drainage water. From bottom to top, it contains five layers: root barrier,
    plastic (high impact polystyrene) drainage, geotextile filter, rockwool water
    retention, and mineral soil mixed with 20% v/v mature compost (Fig. 1). The soil
    with sandy loam texture (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), facilitates free drainage.
    The soil thickness varies between plots, with grass at 35 mm, groundcover at 50
    mm and shrub at 80 mm. An automatic sprinkler irrigation system, which sprays
    daily at 1000 h for 1 h, provides supplementary water supply. Download : Download

    and soil conditions were automatically recorded at a 15 min interval by data loggers
    (8160, Lufft, Fellbach, Germany). Four solar radiation components were recorded:
    incoming and outgoing shortwave, and incoming and outgoing longwave. A four-in-one
    combination type of radiometer (CNR1, Kipp & Zonen, the Netherlands) was mounted
    horizontally at 150 cm above the soil surface. Soil heat flux was monitored by
    a dedicated thermal transmission sensor (HFP01SC of Hukseflux, the Netherlands).
    Soil moisture and temperature sensors (respectively S-SMC and S-TMB, Onset Hobo,
    USA) were buried in different layers of the substrate (soil, rockwool, and the
    original tile surface at the bottom of the green roof setup). Surface temperature
    (bare tile for the control plot, vegetation canopy for the treatment plots) was
    assessed by an infrared radiometer made for outdoor use (SI-111, Apogee, Logan,
    UT, USA). The thermister air temperature probes (8160.TFF, Lufft, Fellbach, Germany)
    with radiation shields were installed at 20, 60, and 200 cm above the ground surface.
    Meteorological factors were observed using a weather station setup (Onset Hobo),
    including air relative humidity (RH), air temperature, dew point temperature,
    wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall. Table 2 lists an extract of the raw
    data set acquired by the sensors. Table 2. An extract of the raw data acquired

    of energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes was computed by the BREB method
    (Malek and Bingham, 1997, Nichols, 1994, Martens et al., 2008). Using our microclimatic
    data, values of net radiation, air temperature gradient, vapor pressure gradient,
    and soil heat flux were used to solve the energy budget, given by heat flux model:
    (1) where Rn is the net radiation flux; H is sensible heat flux which is characterized
    by the surface and atmospheric turbulence between the different forms of heat
    exchange; λE is latent heat flux, referring to the water vapor exchange between
    lower atmosphere and ground, including evaporation from the soil, transpiration
    from vegetation, and latent heat flux denoted by evapotranspiration; G is soil
    heat flux which involves internal heat exchange in the soil; SWi is incoming shortwave
    and SWo outgoing shortwave radiation; LWi is incoming longwave and LWo outgoing
    longwave radiation; SWn is net shortwave (SWi − SWo) and LWn, net longwave (LWi
    − LWo). We adopted W m−2 as the energy unit. The Bowen ratio (β) registers the
    relationship between sensible heat flux to latent heat flux (H/λE), which is determined
    as: (2) where ΔT and Δe are respectively temperature and vapor pressure differences
    between lower and upper levels respectively (kPa), γ is the psychrometric constant;
    ρ is the air pressure (101.23 kPa); Cp is the specific heat of air at constant
    pressure (4190 J kg−1 K−1); ɛ is the ratio between molecular weights of water
    vapor and air (0.622); λ is latent heat of vaporization of water (kJ kg−1), TL
    is air temperature at a certain height (L), Ea is the actual water vapor pressure;
    and E0 is saturation water vapor pressure at a certain temperature (TL). 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Dynamics of heat flux Diurnal and seasonal variations of heat
    flux on green roofs present characteristic hyperbola curves (Fig. 3, Fig. 4),
    showing respectively the net absorption and release of heat energy for diurnal
    and seasonal cycles. For the diurnal cycle, representative data for three typical
    weather days (sunny, cloudy and rainy), in four seasons (winter-January, spring-April,
    summer-July and autumn-October) yield 12 focus days for detailed analysis of the
    four experimental treatments (Fig. 3). They depict the commonality of energy fluxes
    in the temporal-seasonal and major weather patterns. Download : Download full-size

    heat flux (Rn, λE, H and G) variations of four green roof experimental treatments
    in 2008. The Rn, H and λE increase from zero at 0600–0800 h in the morning to
    peak values at 1200–1300 h. They then decrease to zero at around 1800–2000 h,
    and continue to slide into negative values from 2000 h to early morning at 0600–0800
    h. The energy deficit after sunset and at night is more notable for Rn and less
    so for H and λE. G demonstrates a time lag of about 2 h, peaking around 1400–1500
    h with a minimum at about 0600 h. The heat-flux fluctuation is positive when incoming
    radiation exceeds outgoing radiation in sunny daytime. At night, Rn is usually
    negative with domination by outgoing longwave radiation. Rn is zero when the incoming
    and outgoing components are in balance. The magnitude of Rn on green roofs is
    twice that of H, which is comparable to λE. The maximum Rn reaches about 800 W
    m−2 at 1300 h on a summer sunny day in July. For comparison, the maximum H is
    about 400 W m−2 at 1300 h on the same summer sunny day. The variations of H occur
    mainly in daytime, with notable nocturnal suppression when the air temperature
    is relatively low. λE has a similar maximum value of about 400 W m−2 and follows
    a similar temporal pattern. The maximum Rn is nearly twice the maximum H or λE.
    The processes of heat fluxes controlling surface exchanges are typically more
    active in daytime than at night. The energy balance closure statistics and micrometeorological
    analysis indicate that the eddy covariance is less significant during nocturnal
    periods. H is typically negative and λE is typically near-zero at night. In daytime,
    G is usually rather low at less than 10% of Rn. The seasonal heat fluxes on green
    roofs vary with the fluctuations of the underlying meteorological driving forces.
    H and λE follow clearly the seasonal solar radiation regime, with deviations brought
    by the monsoonal rainfall rhythm. G remains markedly low throughout the year in
    comparison with other heat fluxes, with meager quantities in winter and only a
    slight rise in the warm months peaking in summer. The seasonal trends of H and
    λE are affected by rainfall and temperature (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Seasonal H drops
    to a minimum value in winter, especially in January and February, and reaches
    a maximum in summer peaking in July and August. In terms of daily weather condition,
    the maximum occurs on summer sunny day, and the minimum on winter rainy day. λE
    follows a similar seasonal pattern, attaining a maximum value in summer with moderate
    rainfall in July and August, and a minimum in winter with no rainfall in January
    and February (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). By daily weather condition, the maximum occurs
    on the summer sunny day and the minimum on the winter rainy day. The highest flux
    occurs when high temperature coincides with an adequate supply of water to enhance
    evaporation. The diurnal range of λE reaches the widest in summer and narrowest
    in winter, with medium values for both spring and autumn. For all seasons, the
    sunny day registers the widest diurnal range, with suppression on cloudy day,
    and diminishing to almost zero on rainy day. In winter, the subdued λE is mainly
    associated with soil evaporation which is feeble due to low temperature and meager
    rainfall. In summer, the strong λE is augmented by the dual process of evapotranspiration
    under a high temperature regime and sustained by liberal rainfall. Negative λE
    occurs only on the summer rainy day from 1900 to 0400 h. Negative λE exists in
    nighttime in most cases due to net radiation balance effects. In general, negative
    λE indicates a net release of latent energy back to the environment due to condensation
    or freezing. The extreme values of H and λE correlate well with rainfall and temperature
    (Table 3). Rainfall demonstrates differential effects on H and λE (Fig. 4). In
    summer, moderate rainfalls in July and August suppress both H and λE, but not
    Rn. It indicates that the summer rainfall events are mainly of short duration
    and high intensity with little effects on direct solar radiation. However, excessive
    rainfalls in June of prolonged duration curtail sunshine to lower notably Rn and
    λE, with H showing no depression response. In contrast, the limited rainfall associated
    with the prolonged cloudy-humid weather in spring in April, when temperature is
    not high, depresses Rn, H and λE. Table 3. Pearson correlation coefficients between
    net radiation (Rn) of green roof ecosystem and three meteorological factors for

    λE and G) differ notably by experimental treatment (control and vegetation types)
    and temporal groups (diurnal and seasonal changes) (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Rn
    fluctuations for both groups are greater than H and λE. The difference in heat
    flux components between grass and shrub ranges from 83 to 207 W m−2. The Bowen
    ratio (β) extends over a wide range from 0.5 to 1.24 (Table 4). The control has
    the lowest value (0.50–0.57), followed by grass (0.70–0.75), groundcover (0.79–0.83)
    and shrub (0.83–1.24). β increases sequentially with the complexity of biomass
    structure and leaf-area surface: control < grass < groundcover < shrub. The β
    of the control has been raised mainly due to the exceptionally low λE. The low
    vegetation height of grass and groundcover generated similar β values with a comparable
    narrow range. Their small and simple biomass structure enhances evapotranspiration
    due to irrigation effect, leading to increases in both H and λE, but relatively
    more for H in comparison with the control. The taller shrub vegetation with higher
    leaf area and more complex biomass structure notably raises β value and widens
    its range (0.50–1.24) (Fig. 3 and Table 4). The changes in β display a trend similar
    to mean daytime evaporation of the four treatments. The variability of β between
    vegetation treatments could be related to fluctuations of soil moisture due to
    differential ability of roots to access soil water. Average β values vary according
    to vegetation types and weather conditions. Download : Download full-size image

    impacts of meteorological conditions on heat flux dynamics can throw light on
    their interactions. The meteorological conditions affect the Bowen ratio in complex
    ways. From the BREB modeling, we notice that it relies on accurate estimates of
    the Bowen ratio, which in turn relies on accurate measurement of temperature and
    vapor-pressure gradients. The heat flux dynamics calculated by BREB data show
    that the sensible heat component is significant and the evaporative potential
    of the net radiation is greater than actual conversion to latent heat. Physiological
    characteristics between different treatments may cause discrepancies in the meteorological
    influence. The most obvious canopy difference is due to height which leads to
    variations in surface roughness and atmospheric coupling. Thus, grass is poorly
    coupled to the atmosphere whereas shrub is more coupled, so that the control on
    their evapotranspiration is quite different. The results show variations in the
    heat flux of different treatments which is dependent on meteorological conditions.
    On days with low radiation and cloud cover, and particularly associated with rainfall,
    the canopy remains wet for at least some of the evaporative period, and the latent
    heat flux is different from dry and bright days. The difference could be attributed
    to the fact that the evaporation rate of intercepted raindrops is faster than
    the transpiration rate from the plant which is regulated by stomatal resistance.
    The parameters that affect stomatal resistance are not constant, and in particular
    they are known to vary diurnally and with weather conditions to account for some
    deviations in the results. 3.2. Coupling heat flux dynamics with weather conditions
    The temporal heat-flux fluctuations are strongly correlated with meteorological
    variables (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Weather data analysis shows that temperature is one
    of the key determinants of heat flux. Fluctuations of λE are inversely related
    to atmospheric pressure. High values of λE (200–300 W m−2) correspond to low atmosphere
    pressure (100.4 Pa) in summer. Low values of λE (30–50 W m−2) match the high air
    pressure in winter (102.0 Pa). A similar relationship exists between λE and air
    temperature (average 26 °C in summer and 15 °C in winter). For the whole year,
    the minimum λE occurs in the coldest month of January, and maximum latent flux
    in the hottest month of July. λE correlates positively with saturated water vapor
    pressure deficit (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.05), although it shows a fluctuation pattern
    similar to atmospheric pressure and air temperature. The lower λE happens in dry
    winter months and higher λE in wet summer months. λE and H respond differently
    to precipitation. Diurnal variations in the components of surface energy balance
    can be plotted by BREB at hourly intervals (Fig. 3). To analyze the diurnal variations
    in energy balance, three representative weather conditions are selected (sunny,
    cloudy, and rainy) in four seasons. Latent heat flux increases after rainfall
    in both daytime and nighttime, ranging from 4.7 W m−2 (nighttime of January 26)
    to 42.3 W m−2 (daytime of July 15). The augmented amplitude of λE and H is wider
    in daytime (5.7 W m−2) than nighttime (3.6 W m−2). H is reduced by rainfall, dropping
    considerably by 20–75% after rainfall in daytime. Rainfall events of longer duration
    and greater magnitude lead to sharp decrease in H. For example, H drops by 75%
    on April 19 with 153 mm of rainfall, compared to H on April 16. However, it increases
    if rainfall occurs in nighttime or early morning, such as the spike in the morning
    of July 12 (Fig. 3). This may be related to the insulation effect of clouds on
    the thermal radiation regime of the ground. With the onset of the summer rainy
    season, λE responds in a way opposite to H. Rainfall can trigger a rise in λE,
    and the increase can be sustained if the rain continues for a certain period.
    If the rainfall persists for a long time, λE can instead be suppressed. Thus λE
    is more affected by weather conditions in summer than in other seasons. For example,
    a short rainfall event in July adds λE of 94 W m−2. However, low λE values are
    associated with protracted rainfalls in April and October. In summer, the temperature
    rise coupled with increase in rainfall gradually lift λE over time. In winter,
    rainfall mainly establishes relatively low and brief peaks in λE, because individual
    rainfall events have limited augmenting effect on ET. Moreover, winter rainfall
    events are seldom protracted, which seldom suppress λE. These phenomena can be
    explained by the combined effects of high RH and high temperature in wet summer,
    and the combined effects of low RH and strong wind in dry winter. Meanwhile, daytime
    H is notably reduced during high monthly rainfall in July. Overall, the arrival
    of the summer rainy season can suppress H but elevate λE. Evaporation is the major
    cause of λE, which is notably shaped by soil moisture. The diurnal fluctuations
    of soil moisture of grass and groundcover treatments demonstrate a similarly acute
    pattern (high frequency of fluctuations) across a wide amplitude, whereas shrub
    has relatively subdued changes. Grass has the highest soil moisture content, and
    shrub the lowest. Grass has wider fluctuations in soil moisture content which
    is more sensitive to moisture in the near-surface air than groundcover and shrub.
    Soil moisture responds with a time lag to external water supplies and internal
    water losses due to evaporation, root withdrawal and drainage. In a daily cycle,
    soil moisture of the three treatments peaks significantly at 1000 and 2200 h.
    Grass is the wettest, followed by groundcover and shrub. The average soil moisture
    contents of grass, groundcover and shrub are respectively 20.7%, 19.8% and 19.4%
    in winter, and 25.3%, 20.8% and 19.4% in summer. Soil moisture is sensitive to
    precipitation but mediated by vegetation biomass structure. For instance, on April
    19 with 47.4 mm of rainfall from 1400 to 1600 h during which soil moisture reaches
    the peak. At the initial raining stage, soil moisture registers a slight increase
    in grass, but with little effect on groundcover and shrub due to canopy interception.
    With continuation of rain, all treatments indicate obvious increase in soil moisture.
    Plots with thick soil (Section 2.1) induce higher soil moisture content with less
    fluctuation. When rainfall reaches the maximum intensity after 30 min, soil moisture
    gradually rises in all treatments to attain the maximum after 1 h. When rainfall
    begins to wane, soil moisture declines notably faster in grass, followed by groundcover.
    Thereafter, soil moisture remains rather stable for a long period. The rapid decline
    of soil moisture in grass can be explained by fast evaporation loss. Rainfall
    leads to increase in soil moisture, which in turn triggers a corresponding increase
    in evaporation, whereupon λE is augmented. The Bowen ratio can fluctuate quite
    a bit with variations in precipitation and soil moisture. The singularity of the
    Bowen ratio exists preferably in the following conditions: weak turbulence, stable
    stratified stability, dry soil, and humid air. The existence of a singularity
    state renders its dependence on these five variables very complicated. When soil
    moisture availability is greater than the soil capacity, the Bowen ratio is likely
    to be inversely proportional to soil moisture availability. When atmospheric relative
    humidity increases, its absolute value also increases. When the absolute surface
    net radiation increases, its absolute value rises. The impact of net radiation
    on the Bowen ratio is stronger at nighttime than daytime. Soil moisture exerts
    an even stronger impact on it during the daytime unstable condition. However,
    it demonstrates weak responses to changes in soil moisture availability at night.
    It is more sensitive to changes in turbulent intensity. Its response to variations
    in atmospheric relative humidity over a vegetated area is also weak. 3.3. Impact
    of heat flux transmission on cooling effect 3.3.1. Heat flux transmission Rn determines
    λE amount and variation trends. The above analysis shows that the dynamic changes
    of H, λE and G present single-peak quadratic curves. For a diurnal cycle, the
    maximum values of H and λE occur at 1200–1300 h, and G with a time lag at 1500
    h. Seasonal variations are obvious for all three energy flux components of the
    green roof ecosystem. From January to March, H exceeds λE, with average H reaching
    the maximum in March. H exceeds λE by about 24 W m−2 at noon in March. From early
    April, H declines with increase in λE, and thereafter the two values converge.
    In July, the average λE and Rn values reach the maximum in the year. λE exceeds
    H by about 47 W m−2 at noon in July. From August to November, the heat-flux dynamics
    between λE and H is opposite to the earlier trend (January to April), with λE
    declining vis-à-vis H increase. Rn presents smooth hyperbola curves under cloudless
    sunny weather. The maximum Rn occurs at 1200–1300 h in July at around 844 W m−2,
    which is commensurate with the levels of λE and H. G is relatively small compared
    with other variables in the energy balance equation. It is a break-even variable
    in terms of the seasonal cycle. The dynamic diurnal and seasonal changes of G
    is moderate, and it is similar to the variation trend of Rn but with a time lag.
    The maximum G attains only 13.2 W m−2 at 1300–1500 h in July. G is positively
    correlated with soil moisture. It shows that G responds quickly to notable soil
    moisture changes, but has no obvious response to smaller soil moisture variations.
    3.3.2. Cooling effects of green roof from unbalanced energy closure There is a
    considerable range in flux partitioning characteristics (Rn, λE, H and β) (Table
    4). Variability in β across different groups can be analyzed by quantifying general
    weather conditions and group characteristics that control flux partitioning. The
    changes in β due to meteorological control are proportional to vapor pressure
    deficit and net radiation. Flux partitioning by vegetation and substrate is controlled
    by water vapor transport, a large amount of which tends to increase β. The control
    and grass have the lowest β (0.25–0.60), followed by groundcover (0.71–0.83),
    and shrub has the highest (0.79–1.24). Notable variabilities exist between seasons,
    and the most prominent difference between groups is seasonal (from December to
    February). It has the highest Rn (140 W m−2 on average) and lowest β (0.5–0.81)
    in summer, and lowest Rn (37 W m−2) and highest β in winter (1.24). Cooling effects
    under the green roof ecosystem is attributed to the imbalance in energy closure.
    Energy of the green roof ecosystem is unbalanced with the loss of about 15.5%
    due to the lack of soil and canopy heat reserves. The energy balance is different
    between rainy and cloudy days, with less energy loss on rainy than cloudy days,
    and especially with energy surplus on summer rainy days. The results show that
    the sum of H and λE is less than the difference between Rn and G (λE + H < Rn
    − G) of the green roof ecosystem through the analysis of key variables in the
    energy balance system (Rn, λE, H and G). Thus the energy budget is not closed
    in the green roof ecosystem. Energy consumption (λE + H) is less than energy availability
    (Rn − G), with an average ratio of 0.87, indicating that about 13% of the energy
    loss is absorbed by the building structure. Energy loss varies in time, reaching
    the maximum in November and December for a whole-year cycle. Energy loss is less
    for a rainy day compared with sunny day. For example, average energy loss was
    10% on a sunny day in June, but only 2% on a rainy day in June. The detailed mechanisms
    for the lack of energy closure are not fully understood, but a portion of this
    imbalance is likely to be an underestimation of the heat storage (in the soil,
    air and biomass) components (G). Underestimating these components would not affect
    the results in this study. There is no overall indication of differences in closure
    with β, which may suggest that H and λE are both systematically underestimated
    by a similar relative proportion. Therefore, we believe that the relative partitioning
    between H and λE is generally accurate, but that the total magnitude of turbulent
    fluxes may be biased towards the low side. 4. Conclusions The study assessed the
    ecological dynamics of heat flux transmission and energy balance of the green
    roof ecosystem so as to develop a scientific basis for its design and management.
    The results show that the heat flux components of the green roof ecosystem express
    peculiar life cycle characteristics. The dynamic changes of fluxes in sensible
    heat, latent heat and soil heat demonstrate single-peak quadratic curves. The
    net radiation determines the quantity and variation trends of latent heat flux.
    Diurnal and seasonal variations of heat fluxes form hyperbola curves. Seasonal
    heat fluxes vary with the fluctuation of meteorological driving forces. Extreme
    values of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes correlate well with rainfall and
    temperature. The dynamics of heat flux magnitude and partitioning demonstrate
    notable differences amongst daily time periods and seasons which are dependent
    on group characteristics. Temporal heat-flux fluctuations are strongly correlated
    with meteorological variables. Latent heat and sensible heat fluxes show major
    differences in response to precipitation. Temperature is one of the key contributors
    to heat flux. Latent heat flux is inversely related to atmospheric pressure. Evaporation
    is the principal determinant of latent heat flux and soil moisture. There is a
    considerable range in flux partitioning characteristics (Rn, λE, H, and β). Fluctuation
    trends of Bowen ratio are strongly influenced by weather condition and vegetation
    type. The cooling effect of the green roof ecosystem is due to the imbalance of
    energy closure. The characteristics of plant canopy and soil properties contribute
    to heat loss of green roof ecosystem which leads to an unbalanced energy closure.
    Meteorological conditions, such as the amount, duration and density of clouds
    and precipitation, incur variations in heat flux components in relation to the
    energy closure analysis. Acknowledgements We acknowledge with gratitude the grants

    \ Agriculture 4.0 has emerged as an evolution of precision\nagriculture (PA) through\
    \ the diﬀusion of the Internet of things (IoT). There is a perception that the\n\
    PA adoption is occurring at a slower pace than expected. Little research has been\
    \ carried out about\nAgriculture 4.0, as well as to farmer behavior and operations\
    \ management. This work explores what\ndrives the adoption of PA in the Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 context, focusing on farmer behavior and operations\nmanagement. As a result\
    \ of a multimethod approach, the factors explaining the PA adoption in the\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0 context and a model of irrigation operations management are proposed. Six\
    \ simulation\nscenarios are performed to study the relationships among the factors\
    \ involved in irrigation planning.\nEmpirical ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding\
    \ of what Agriculture 4.0 is and to expand the\npossibilities of IoT in the PA\
    \ domain. This work also contributes to the discussion on Agriculture\n4.0, thanks\
    \ to multidisciplinary research bringing together the diﬀerent perspectives of\
    \ PA, IoT and\noperations management. Moreover, this research highlights the key\
    \ role of IoT, considering the\nfarmer’s possible choice to adopt several IoT\
    \ sensing technologies for data collection.\nKeywords: precision agriculture;\

    Agriculture is changing in recent years and, in the same way as the industry,\
    \ is forced to modernize\nits work methodologies and to take advantage of opportunities\
    \ oﬀered by the Internet of things\n(IoT) [1]. Despite this progress, it still\
    \ cannot be claimed that precision agriculture (PA) has been\nwidely established\
    \ [2]. There is a perception that the adoption of PA is occurring at a slower\
    \ pace than\nexpected [3]. A conﬁrmation of this perception can be found in the\
    \ abundant literature that addresses\nthe analysis of the factors aﬀecting the\
    \ adoption of PA, such as the recent studies of [3–6].\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s20247091\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n\
    2 of 32\nIoT plays a key role in agriculture since the sensors can measure several\
    \ quantities continuously,\nand by using the cloud processing power [7], it is\
    \ possible to create models to evaluate the crop\ndevelopment and soil resources\
    \ and water availability to support the decision-making process or even\nagriculture\
    \ automation. Such models can evaluate evapotranspiration [8] or soil properties\
    \ and their\ndynamics or even evaluate water demands in paddy areas. Data from\
    \ crop obtained by IoT sensors and\nmeshed up with data gathered by additional\
    \ IoT devices, such as drones and remote sensing devices,\nmake it possible to\
    \ correlate a multitude of parameters that helps in a broader crop understanding\
    \ and\nto better approach the crop growth dynamics. The IoT sensing technologies\
    \ make room for innovative\nways to better use natural resources like water in\
    \ irrigation [9,10].\nIoT is also one of the key technologies for Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 [11]. This concept appeared at the\nbeginning of the 21st century, as an\
    \ evolution of the PA concept through the diﬀusion of IoT [12].\nLittle research\
    \ has been carried out about Agriculture 4.0 and, in particular, on operations\
    \ management\nin this context [13,14]. Agriculture 4.0 is still restricted and\
    \ put oﬀ in theory and limited to some\npioneering companies [15]. This means\
    \ that a more in-depth analysis is needed to understand what\nAgriculture 4.0\
    \ is [16].\nSeveral studies highlight the potential of Agriculture 4.0, such as\
    \ improvements in planning\nand control [17], intelligent use of data collected\
    \ by using advanced technologies mounted on board\ntractors, mobile ground robots,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites [18] and sustainable\ngrowth\
    \ [11]. Others highlight the challenges to be solved. For example, data by its\
    \ nature in a scenario\nof Agriculture 4.0 becomes complex to manage both in terms\
    \ of size and complexity of the analysis to\nbe carried out [18]. A few mention\
    \ some factors related to operation management, like the mobility\nof production\
    \ facilities and coverage of agricultural ﬁelds [1,17]. However, these studies\
    \ do not\ninvestigate the relationship between factors and the adoption of PA\
    \ in the context of Agriculture 4.0.\nSome researchers have suggested potential\
    \ areas of investigation for studying the PA in the 4.0 era. [12],\nto broaden\
    \ the understanding of determinant factors in the adoption recommends studying\
    \ farmer\nbehavior, the ﬁeld which has as its reference to the theory of planned\
    \ behavior (TPB) [19]. TPB has been\napplied in agriculture by some researchers,\
    \ like [20], but not yet in the Agriculture 4.0 context. Ref. [21]\nsuggests carrying\
    \ out an analysis regarding whether the inspiration for the concept of Industry\
    \ 4.0\ncan facilitate the establishment of operational solutions to explain the\
    \ unexplored potential of PA in\nagricultural operations.\nTherefore, this research\
    \ seeks to contribute to ﬁlling these gaps by answering the following question:\n\
    What drives the adoption of precision agriculture in the context of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, focusing on farmer\nbehavior and operations management? To answer this\
    \ question, this research aims to achieve the\nfollowing objectives: exploring\
    \ the factors that can aﬀect the adoption of precision agriculture in the\ncontext\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0; proposing a model to understand and formalize agricultural\
    \ operations\nmanagement based on identiﬁed factors; performing simulation scenarios,\
    \ to study the relationships\namong the identiﬁed factors that allow the design\
    \ of the model of agricultural operations management.\nThis model and the simulation\
    \ results support the development of theory on the adoption of PA in the\ncontext\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0.\nConsidering the general lack of theory on Agriculture 4.0,\
    \ this research adopts a multimethod\napproach consisting of interviews with experts,\
    \ case studies, modeling techniques and simulations.\nSemi-structured interviews\
    \ with experts [22] and case studies [23] are carried out to explore the\nfactors\
    \ that can aﬀect the adoption investigated. Empirical ﬁndings are used to ground\
    \ the model of\nagricultural operations management and the simulation scenarios\
    \ [24–26], which guide in supporting\nthe development of theory on the adoption\
    \ of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0. The simulation\nallows the elaboration\
    \ of theories and the accomplishment of exploratory works [27]. Still, in an\n\
    era where more data are available, it is possible to create simulation models\
    \ based on real data,\nusing IoT and sensors [28]. The operations investigated\
    \ are those relating to irrigation, in line with\nthe international project SWAMP\
    \ (smart water management platform), of which this work is part.\nThis project\
    \ involves pilots in Brazil, Italy and Spain, focusing on diﬀerent crop types\
    \ and irrigation\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n3 of 32\ntechniques. SWAMP project intends\
    \ to bring the concept of IoT for precision irrigation [7]. Aligned to\ndisseminate\
    \ the results of the SWAMP project, this work includes the irrigation of the açaí\
    \ palm,\na plant native from the Amazon region, whose cultivation is expanding\
    \ in upland areas. Açaí palm\nfruit has been showing increasing importance in\
    \ exports to European, Asian and North American\ncountries [29,30].\nTo model\
    \ the agricultural operations management related to irrigation, the integration\
    \ deﬁnition\nfor function modeling (IDEF0) methodology is used. Farm enterprises\
    \ are complex systems that need\nto be modeled to facilitate knowledge capitalization\
    \ and information system design. [31]. IDEF0 is\nused to identify the system components,\
    \ data requirements, the ﬂow of information and objects among\nthe components\
    \ [32]. The modeling of operations management, in particular, planning, scheduling\n\
    and control, through IDEF0, has been applied by several researchers in the industrial\
    \ sector [33,34].\nHowever, IDEF0 has rarely been used in the agricultural sector.\
    \ Examples of applications are the\nstudies of [31] and [35].\nSince IDEF0 models\
    \ attempt to capture the functional components of an enterprise or a system,\n\
    rather than temporal constraints and ﬂow [25], IDEF0 methodology, as a static\
    \ model, can be used\nto create simulations for dynamic analysis [36]. Examples\
    \ of applications combining the IDEF0\nmethodology and simulation are the works\
    \ of [37] and of [32]. The simulation was applied to study\nthe technology adoption\
    \ for agriculture by some researchers, such as [38].\nTo perform the simulation\
    \ scenarios, irrigation planning is chosen since it involves the deﬁnitions\n\
    of water requirements and of irrigation time, which are two priority decisions\
    \ in irrigation water\nmanagement. These decisions also have a direct eﬀect on\
    \ the eﬃciency of water use [39,40].\nAnother important parameter in the study\
    \ of irrigation planning is the reference evapotranspiration\nthat can be used\
    \ with diﬀerent crop characteristics to produce proper crop water requirements\
    \ [8,41].\nThe crop water requirements are necessary for water resources planning\
    \ and irrigation water\nmanagement [42–44]. There are several methods to estimate\
    \ the reference evapotranspiration, despite the\nwidespread of the FOAM model\
    \ due to its consistency in diﬀerent climatic regions [41,43,45].\nThis study\
    \ is ambitious since, in contrast to previous research on Agriculture 4.0, focused\
    \ mainly\non automation, robotics, food and sustainability, explores farmer behavior\
    \ and operations management.\nAs a result of empirical research, this work extends\
    \ the current knowledge on Agriculture 4.0, proposing\na list of categories and\
    \ factors that can explain the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0.\n\
    In contrast to previous research on agriculture, the proposed model of irrigation\
    \ operations management\ndiﬀerentiates between irrigation planning and irrigation\
    \ scheduling, highlighting the role of irrigation\nresources. The simulation results\
    \ allow studying the relationships among some parameters involved in\nirrigation\
    \ planning, contributing to a better understanding of what Agriculture 4.0 is.\
    \ This work also\ncontributes to the Agriculture 4.0 discussion. The access to\
    \ data and irrigation planning can be improved\nthrough the possibility the farmer\
    \ must adopt several IoT sensing technologies. This highlights the key\nrole of\
    \ IoT in the evolution of PA.\nThe purpose of this work is signiﬁcant due to a\
    \ multidisciplinary approach. By combining the\ncompetencies of PA, IoT and operations\
    \ management, this work allows us to progress in the knowledge\nof Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, bringing together diﬀerent perspectives. These perspectives lead to propose\
    \ a\ndeﬁnition of what Agriculture 4.0 is as a result of empirical ﬁndings and\
    \ based on the deﬁnitions of\nAgriculture 4.0, PA and IoT. Moreover, this work\
    \ leads to expand the possibilities of the IoT in the\ndomain of PA, also concerning\
    \ the irrigation operations management.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section\
    \ 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 introduces the\nmultimethod approach,\
    \ while Section 4 presents the results of this study. Section 5 discusses these\n\
    ﬁndings and presents the limitations and further research. Finally, Section 6\
    \ draws conclusions.\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n4 of 32\n2. Related Work\nMany evaluation\
    \ criteria shape the adoption of novel information and communication technology\n\
    in general [46]. In this section, related work is presented to explore the factors\
    \ that can aﬀect the\nadoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0.\n2.1.\
    \ Precision Agriculture and Factors Aﬀecting the Adoption\nIn the literature,\
    \ it is possible to ﬁnd more than 20 deﬁnitions of precision agriculture. This\
    \ lack of\na clear and shared deﬁnition makes it diﬃcult to study the adoption\
    \ [3]. Moreover, the factors aﬀecting\nthe adoption rates depend on the type of\
    \ PA technologies [5], which are many, such as remote sensing\n(including soil\
    \ sensing, satellite remote sensing and proximal remote sensing), yield monitoring\
    \ and\nmapping, variable rate technology, grid or zone soil sampling [3,47]. However,\
    \ the International\nSociety for precision agriculture (ISPA) recently recognized\
    \ the following as the oﬃcial deﬁnition of\nPA: “Precision Agriculture is a management\
    \ strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial\nand individual\
    \ data and combines it with other information to support management decisions\
    \ according to\nestimated variability for improved resource use eﬃciency, productivity,\
    \ quality, proﬁtability and sustainability of\nagricultural production” [48].\n\
    The abundant literature that addresses the study of the factors aﬀecting the PA\
    \ adoption\nfocuses on the analysis of farmer and farm characteristics, of economic\
    \ factors and PA technology\ncharacteristics [6,49,50]. The factors related to\
    \ the agricultural operations management are few studied,\nand the factors related\
    \ to Agriculture 4.0 are practically absent, as well as the application of the\
    \ TPB.\nMost works apply the survey research method, such as [6]. Qualitative\
    \ research methods were applied\nby a few researchers to study the PA adoption,\
    \ as highlighted by [4].\n2.2. IoT Sensing Technologies in Precision Agriculture\n\
    There are several kinds of IoT sensing technologies being used to estimate the\
    \ use of water in the\nagriculture and crop parameters. The parameters that these\
    \ IoT sensing technologies make available\nfor irrigation water management are\
    \ summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1. Parameters measured through the Internet of\

    Sensors 2020, 20, 7091\n5 of 32\nThe use of soil probes allows obtaining several\
    \ key soil parameters like soil moisture, soil salinity\nand soil temperature\
    \ at several depths [51]. Local weather stations are devices to capture local\n\
    environmental data as air temperature and air relative humidity, important parameters\
    \ to evaluate\nevapotranspiration. Both sources of data make it possible to evaluate\
    \ the eﬀects of weather and\nsoil in the water requirements because they indirectly\
    \ capture the dynamic crop water demands.\nOther relevant parameters as canopy\
    \ temperature, vegetation indexes such as normalized diﬀerence\nvegetation index\
    \ (NDVI) and growing degree days (GDD) [59] can be obtained from infrared and\n\
    near-infrared bands (B4, B6, B8 bands) of the electromagnetic spectrum [60,61].\
    \ Those combined\nparameters may produce a crop model with a minimum of estimated\
    \ parameters [51]. All those data\nmay be combined through GPS coordinates and\
    \ time parameters to estimate the amount of water\nbeing used by the crop and\
    \ estimate water requirements.\nThe parameters shown in Table 1 are considered\
    \ in the empirical investigation, in the exploration\nof factors that can aﬀect\
    \ the PA adoption in the Agriculture 4.0 context.\n2.3. Agriculture 4.0 and Factors\
    \ Related to Operations Management\nAt present, Agriculture 4.0 is a vague and\
    \ poorly deﬁned term. Some authors use in the same\nway Agriculture 4.0 and smart\
    \ farming or Farming 4.0 or digital agriculture [2,12,15], some authors\nuse Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 to refer to the fourth agricultural revolution [62], other authors use Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nas an evolution of Industry 4.0 [11,15,17] or as an evolution of the precision\
    \ agriculture [2,11,15].\nSome recent works have contributed to a better understanding\
    \ of the concepts of digitalization in\nagriculture, smart farming and Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Digitalization in agriculture implies that management\ntasks on-farm and\
    \ oﬀ-farm focus on diﬀerent sorts of data, using sensors, machines, drones and\
    \ satellites\nto make more timely or accurate decisions. The concepts of smart\
    \ farming, precision agriculture,\ndigital agriculture, Agriculture 4.0 are emerged\
    \ to express diﬀerent forms of digitalization in the\nagricultural sector [63].\n\
    Smart farming represents the use of smart, data-rich ICT-services and\napplications,\
    \ in combination with advanced hardware (in tractors, greenhouses, etc.). Smart\
    \ farming\nextends the precision agriculture concept since the existing tasks\
    \ for management and decision-making\nbased on data are enhanced by context, situation\
    \ and location awareness [64]. Smart farming includes\nthree main categories of\
    \ technologies: farm management information systems (FMIS), precision\nagriculture\
    \ (PA) and agricultural automation and robotics [65].\nAs for Agriculture 4.0,\
    \ recently [16] propose a holistic deﬁnition, based on a systematic literature\n\
    review, taking a multiperspective approach and covering the entire agricultural\
    \ and food value chain.\nIn line with the scope of the SWAMP project, focused\
    \ on bringing the IoT concept for precision\nirrigation in farm pilots, in this\
    \ work, the deﬁnition of [16] is used, but limited to the boundaries of\nthe single\
    \ farm: “Agriculture 4.0 is the evolution of precision agriculture, realized through\
    \ the automated\ncollection, integration and analysis of previously separated\
    \ data silos coming from the ﬁeld, equipment sensors\nand other third-party sources,\
    \ enabled by the use of smart and digital technologies of Industry 4.0, making\
    \ in\nthis way possible the generation of knowledge, to support the farmer in\
    \ the decision-making process in the farm\nenterprise”.\nResearch on Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 is mainly concentrated on automation and robotics [66,67], food\nand sustainability\
    \ [11,14,62]. While studies on operations management, inspired by the concept\
    \ of\nIndustry 4.0, are limited. Operations management in agriculture deals with\
    \ the design, planning,\nscheduling and execution of machine and human operations.\
    \ An operation in agriculture is generally\nseen as the link between resources,\
    \ materials processed, and material produced. Agricultural operations\nmay, for\
    \ instance, be tillage, seeding, fertilizing, plant care, irrigation and harvesting\
    \ [21,68].\nThe inspiration for Industry 4.0 identiﬁes some advantages that can\
    \ be introduced in agriculture,\nsuch as improvements in agricultural planning\
    \ and control [17]. But, the wave of Industry 4.0 also\nprovides new challenges\
    \ that traditional farming has to overcome [69]. When compared to classic\nindustrial\
    \ production, agricultural ﬁeld operations interact with a biologically active\
    \ system. Industrial\nproduction takes place in close, well-deﬁned environments\
    \ in which performance data can be measured\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n6 of 32\n\
    by deterministic matters. In agricultural operations, by the uncertain nature,\
    \ many adjustments\nare possible to optimize the operational methods [21]. The\
    \ production process in agriculture is\ndiﬀerent from the industrial one in several\
    \ aspects: preponderant role of the environment and inherent\nuncertainty and\
    \ risk (e.g., crop growth, weather conditions); large time constants of planning\
    \ procedure;\ncomplexity in evaluating risky decisions [68]. The high degree of\
    \ mobility of the production facilities\nmakes planning and control more diﬃcult\
    \ than in industrial environments. Even the availability and\nbandwidth of wireless\
    \ connections are subject to disturbing inﬂuences, making constant communication\n\
    diﬃcult [17]. Moreover, wireless communication technology must provide coverages\
    \ ranging from\ntens of meters to several kilometers since sensors could be deployed\
    \ far and in remote locations within\nthe crop ﬁeld [1].\nThe advantages and challenges\
    \ analyzed in this section highlight some factors related to\nagricultural operations\
    \ management that are considered in the empirical investigation.\n2.4. Farmer\
    \ Behavior and Factors Aﬀecting the Adoption\nTo explore the farmer behavior,\
    \ the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is applied, which has been\nwidely applied\
    \ to study behavior in diﬀerent domains, such as innovative technologies for mobility\
    \ [70],\ntechnology adoption in agriculture [71], water-saving measures for irrigation\
    \ [72]. Behavioral intention\nto use products or technologies can be used as an\
    \ indicator of their adoption [46].\nThe TPB is a theory developed to predict\
    \ and explain behaviors that are not under complete\nvolitional control. Intentions\
    \ are assumed to capture the motivational factors that inﬂuence behavior.\nIntentions\
    \ to perform behaviors can be predicted with an accuracy of attitude (the degree\
    \ to which a\nperson has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behavior),\
    \ subjective norm (perceived social\npressure to perform or not perform the behavior)\
    \ and perceived behavioral control (perceived ease or\ndiﬃculty of carrying out\
    \ the behavior, presence or absence of requisite resources and opportunities).\n\
    The more favorable the attitude and the subjective norm and the larger the perceived\
    \ behavioral\ncontrol, the stronger is the intention to perform the behavior under\
    \ consideration [19]. For performing\na given behavior, the person believes that\
    \ the advantages outweigh the disadvantages [73]. Moreover,\nthe more resources\
    \ and opportunities individuals believe they possess and the fewer obstacles or\n\
    impediments they anticipate, the greater should be their perceived control over\
    \ the behavior [19].\nIn addition to the three predictors, domain-speciﬁc factors\
    \ are both useful and important for gaining a\ncomplete understanding of any behavior\
    \ [73].\nIn rural studies, attitude is a central factor concerning the understanding\
    \ of farmers’\ndecision-making processes [74]. Regarding the adoption process,\
    \ innovations could be successfully\nestablished if farmers see clear beneﬁts\
    \ on them [75].\nOther factors speciﬁc to the agricultural\ndomain are demographic\
    \ characteristics, farm size, conservativeness, access to data and access to the\n\
    market [20,21,72,76–78]. Studies analyzing the factors related to operations are\
    \ rare, such as the work\nof [79].\nSince the purpose of this work is to study\
    \ the adoption in farms, subjective norm is considered\noutside the scope.\n3.\

    \ [38], operations management [32–34],\nincluding questions about the challenges\
    \ related to inspiration for Industry 4.0 [1,17,21,68].\nThe questionnaire is\
    \ shown in Table A1 in Appendix A. The questionnaire consists of two parts:\n\
    open questions for each TPB predictor in scope (attitude, perceived behavioral\
    \ control) and additional\nquestions focused on operations management in irrigation.\
    \ Considering the exploratory nature of the\nresearch, to reduce response bias,\
    \ the deﬁnition of Agriculture 4.0 used in this work was not provided\nto interviewees\
    \ [22,86]. A pilot interview was conducted for testing the questionnaire [80].\
    \ All the\ninterviews were taped and transcribed. Moreover, ﬁeld notes were taken.\n\
    3.2. Case Studies for Exploring the Agriculture 4.0 Adoption\nFour case studies\
    \ were conducted: two in pilots of the SWAMP project (MATOPIBA pilot in Brazil\n\
    and CBEC pilot in Italy); two in açaí palm farms in Brazil. The ratio of this\
    \ choice was since diﬀerent\nirrigation techniques are applied in these cases\
    \ so that this exploratory study can be conducted in\ndiﬀerent conditions.\nThe\
    \ MATOPIBA pilot is located in a region which encompasses the Brazilian states\
    \ of Maranhão\n(MA), Tocantins (TO), Piauí (PI) and Bahia (BA), which is a critical\
    \ irrigated agriculture frontier in the\ncountry. The key challenge for this pilot\
    \ is to reduce energy consumption that represents up to 30% of\nthe production\
    \ costs by implementing and evaluating a smart irrigation system based on variable\
    \ rate\nirrigation (VRI). This pilot must deal with communication instability\
    \ and distance from the farm oﬃce\nto the central pivots. The central pivot is\
    \ the irrigation technique adopted in this case. The pilot area,\nwhich alternates\
    \ soybeans and cotton, is further divided into diﬀerent management zones based\
    \ on\ndiﬀerences in the soil properties [7].\nThe CBEC (Consorzio di Boniﬁca Emilia\
    \ Centrale) pilot is located in the Emilia-Romagna region\nin Northern Italy.\
    \ In this pilot, three selected farms, which grow diﬀerent crops (vineyards and\
    \ pears)\nand use diﬀerent irrigation techniques, are involved. The key challenges\
    \ of this pilot are calculating\nthe irrigation requirement considering the real\
    \ water needs from the ﬁelds and optimizing water\ndistribution to the farms,\
    \ based on the real irrigation demand coming from the farms [7]. For this work,\n\
    the pear farm is analyzed for the ease of access to the farmer and the greater\
    \ interest of the farmer in\nexperimenting with new technologies.\nTwo açaí farms,\
    \ located in the state of Pará (Brazil), were selected for farmer interest in\n\
    experimenting with advanced irrigation systems. In addition to purposive sampling,\
    \ convenience\nsampling was adopted for the ease of access to the two farmers\
    \ and their farms [84].\nThe questionnaire used in the case studies was based\
    \ on the theory of planned behavior [19,73,85],\nfocused on irrigation and agriculture\
    \ [38], operations management [32–34], including questions about\nthe challenges\
    \ related to inspiration for Industry 4.0 [1,17,21,68]. The unit of analysis was\
    \ the farm.\nThe questionnaire used in case studies of açaí palm farms is illustrated\
    \ in Table A2 in Appendix B.\nThe interviewees were the farm manager of the MATOPIBA\
    \ pilot (farm manager), the farmer of\nthe CBEC pilot (farmer A) and the farmers\
    \ of the two açaí palm farms (farmer B and C). Considering\nthe exploratory nature\
    \ of the research, to reduce response bias, the deﬁnition of Agriculture 4.0 used\
    \ in\nthis work was not provided to interviewees [22,86]. Some questions were\
    \ asked in diﬀerent forms\nand using some diﬀerent words, but with the same purpose,\
    \ depending on whether the interviewee\nwas an expert, a farmer of a SWAMP pilot\
    \ or an açaí palm farmer. The questions based on TPB were\nthe same in the questionnaires\
    \ for expert interviews and used in the case studies of the two pilots,\nwith\
    \ the diﬀerence in the context (Agriculture 4.0 in the ﬁrst, while the SWAMP project\
    \ in the second).\nRegarding the two açaí palm farmers, instead of the word SWAMP,\
    \ reference was made to sensors and\ndrones in the questions because these are\
    \ some equipment the farmer can identify as representative\nof innovative technologies\
    \ for irrigation, as well as being equipment included in the Agriculture\n4.0\
    \ context.\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n9 of 32\n3.3. Modelling of Irrigation Operations\
    \ Management\nTo model the agricultural operations management related to irrigation,\
    \ integration deﬁnition\nfor function modeling (IDEF0) methodology was used. IDEF0\
    \ is a modeling technique based on\nthe Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories\
    \ integrated computer-aided manufacturing (ICAM)\narchitecture for developing\
    \ structured graphical representations of a system or enterprise. The use\nof\
    \ this standard permits the construction of models comprising system functions\
    \ (activities, actions,\nprocesses, operations), functional relationships and\
    \ data (information or objects) within the modeled\nsystem or subject area.\n\
    For new systems, IDEF0 may be used ﬁrst to deﬁne the requirements\nand specify\
    \ the functions and then to design an implementation that meets the requirements\
    \ and\nperforms the functions [87]. The main strengths of IDEF0, compared to many\
    \ other functional\nmodeling methodologies, are: simplicity, as it uses only one\
    \ notational construct, called the ICOM\n(input–control–output–mechanism); precision,\
    \ as the building of a diagram, is governed by many\nrules and conventions; data\
    \ abstraction through a hierarchical decomposition of the system [88–90].\nMoreover,\
    \ several sources of information—interfaces—can be identiﬁed (inputs, outputs,\
    \ controls and\nmechanisms), and management tools requirements can furthermore\
    \ be pointed out [31].\nAn IDEF0 model consists of a hierarchical series of diagram\
    \ blocks and the main components of\nwhich are box and arrow. In a diagram, shown\
    \ in Figure 2, a box represents a function, and an arrow\nrepresents an interface.\n\

    \ \n3.3. Modelling of Irrigation Operations Management \nTo model the agricultural\
    \ operations management related to irrigation, integration definition for \nfunction\
    \ modeling (IDEF0) methodology was used. IDEF0 is a modeling technique based on\
    \ the Air \nForce Wright Aeronautical Laboratories integrated computer-aided manufacturing\
    \ (ICAM) \narchitecture for developing structured graphical representations of\
    \ a system or enterprise. The use of \nthis standard permits the construction\
    \ of models comprising system functions (activities, actions, \nprocesses, operations),\

    \ the requirements and \nspecify the functions and then to design an implementation\
    \ that meets the requirements and \nperforms the functions [87]. The main strengths\
    \ of IDEF0, compared to many other functional \nmodeling methodologies, are: simplicity,\
    \ as it uses only one notational construct, called the ICOM \n(input–control–output–mechanism);\
    \ precision, as the building of a diagram, is governed by many \nrules and conventions;\
    \ data abstraction through a hierarchical decomposition of the system [88–90].\
    \ \nMoreover, several sources of information—interfaces—can be identified (inputs,\
    \ outputs, controls \nand mechanisms), and management tools requirements can furthermore\
    \ be pointed out [31]. \nAn IDEF0 model consists of a hierarchical series of diagram\
    \ blocks and the main components of \nwhich are box and arrow. In a diagram, shown\
    \ in Figure 2, a box represents a function, and an arrow \nrepresents an interface.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. Integration definition for function modeling (IDEF0) function\
    \ box and interface arrows. \nAn interface may be an input, an output, a control\
    \ or a mechanism and is assigned a descriptive \nnoun phrase. Inputs (I) enter\
    \ the box from the left, are transformed by the function and exit the box \nto\
    \ the right as an output (O). A control (C) enters the top of the box and influences\
    \ or determines the \nfunction performed. A control is a piece of information\
    \ that facilitates the execution of the function \n(i.e., a written procedure,\
    \ an oral command, a worker experience, etc.). A mechanism (M) is a tool or \n\
    resource which performs the function. Each box on the diagram may be decomposed\
    \ into a lower \nlevel of detail. This feature restricts the amount of information\
    \ that may be contained in the model \non a single level. The resulting diagrams\
    \ form a hierarchy of information that is summarized in a \nnode tree [25]. \n\
    A systematic methodology for static functional specification of system or enterprise\
    \ [32], IDEF0 \ncan be used in combination with simulation models for the support\
    \ it provides in model \ndocumentation and data collection. The level of model\
    \ detail has clear implications for data collection. \nAs the model detail increases,\
    \ more data may be introduced, with an impact on the development of \nthe simulation\

    \ of the weather station and satellite, shown in Table 1 and \nlimiting to the\
    \ MATOPIBA pilot context, the simulation uses irrigation water requirements \n\
    estimation in line with [8,41,91]. In this study, the simulations are performed\
    \ using six scenarios \nFigure 2. Integration deﬁnition for function modeling\
    \ (IDEF0) function box and interface arrows.\nAn interface may be an input, an\
    \ output, a control or a mechanism and is assigned a descriptive\nnoun phrase.\
    \ Inputs (I) enter the box from the left, are transformed by the function and\

    \ piece of information that facilitates the execution of the function\n(i.e.,\
    \ a written procedure, an oral command, a worker experience, etc.). A mechanism\
    \ (M) is a tool or\nresource which performs the function. Each box on the diagram\
    \ may be decomposed into a lower level\nof detail. This feature restricts the\

    \ the case of “performance\nmeasures”, the factors “water use eﬃciency”, “energy\
    \ cost” and “water cost”) [98]. The categories and\nfactors identiﬁed were then\
    \ applied to the data collected in the case studies to carry out within-case\n\
    analysis and cross-case pattern search [23]. Findings from interviews with experts\
    \ and case studies\nwere triangulated in order to allow a surplus of knowledge\
    \ [22].\n4.1. Factors That Can Aﬀect the Adoption Resulting from Interviews with\
    \ Experts\nThe factors resulting from expert interviews are shown in Table A3\
    \ in Appendix C, classiﬁed\naccording to the TPB predictors and associated with\
    \ the categories resulting from the related work.\nTable A3 presents a selection\
    \ of quotes from expert interviews. The answers to the additional questions\n\
    were associated with the most appropriate category, according to the three-level\
    \ coding process\ndescribed above. Factors not related to operations management\
    \ and factors related to external actors\nto the farm are considered outside the\
    \ scope of this work.\nPerformance measures, access to data, operations planning\
    \ and control are the advantages of the\nadoption of PA in the context of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 indicated by most of the experts. Regarding performance\nmeasures, expert\
    \ D stated: “In the case of precision agriculture for irrigation, the topic of\
    \ cost reduction\nis essential, because you will work with minimizing resources\
    \ and optimizing inputs”. Expert H relates\nwater-saving to energy cost: “If you\
    \ are using less water, you are also using less energy”. Expert I highlighted\n\
    the fundamental role of water variable rate management to achieve irrigation eﬃciency.\
    \ Experts H\nand G said that the use of sensors leads to access to much more data,\
    \ such as evapotranspiration,\nsoil characteristics, crop characteristics and\
    \ rainfall. Expert H added that all this information could be\nused to calculate\
    \ the irrigation water requirement.\nRegarding operations planning and control,\
    \ experts A, E and F suggested adopting the industrial\nmodel, which consists\
    \ of the components: planning, scheduling and control. Expert A recommended\n\
    scheduling tools and Gantt chart, while expert E and F highlighted the challenges\
    \ of factor “weather”.\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n13 of 32\nMost interviewees indicated\
    \ the following factors as critical: irrigation planning, weather forecast,\n\
    harvest time, irrigation window, irrigation execution, irrigation control, performance\
    \ indicators and\nfarm size. Expert F mentioned the farm resources (raw material,\
    \ equipment and people) involved in\nthe operations. Experts A and E added sensors,\
    \ which provide data to apply variable rate irrigation,\nas stated by expert I.\
    \ Expert H highlighted the advantage of automation in activating the resources\n\
    of the irrigation system. However, expert I stated that the factors “mobility\
    \ degree of production\nfacilities” and “coverage of agricultural ﬁeld” pose challenges\
    \ for operations planning and control\nrelated to farm size and connectivity infrastructure.\n\
    The main change in the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0 entails\
    \ for the farmer is the\nmanagement of the rural property and agricultural operations,\
    \ as declared by the experts D, G and F.\n4.2. Factors That Can Aﬀect the Adoption\

    \ farm area of the MATOPIBA pilot is 105 hectares. The source of water for irrigation\
    \ is a\nriver. The irrigation technique is the central pivot. Two pivots are supplied\
    \ by electrical pumps,\nincluding the pilot pivot; the other pivots are supplied\
    \ through a reservoir located in the middle of the\nfarm. The reservoir, with\
    \ a capacity of 150,000 m3, allows reducing evaporation (around 20%) during\n\
    water distribution. Regarding the CBEC pilot, the experimental area is 1.2 hectares.\
    \ Access to water\noccurs through Consorzio di Boniﬁca Centrale, which distributes\
    \ water to farms through a complex\ninfrastructure of canals and pump stations.\
    \ The irrigation technique is drip irrigation. The ﬁrst açaí\npalm farm has not\
    \ yet been irrigated. A well, located about 500 m away from the cultivated area,\n\
    is available for irrigation. In the second açaí palm, access to water occurs through\
    \ three springs.\nThe farmer does not currently irrigate açaí palm cultivation\
    \ as it rains enough.\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n14 of 32\nIn the MATOPIBA pilot,\
    \ the expectation of the farm manager is to optimize water use and to\nreduce\
    \ the irrigation cost, which is mainly the electricity cost. If he can use the\
    \ necessary amount of\nwater according to the type of soil and the water holding\
    \ capacity of each pivot zone, he will be able to\noptimize both ﬁnancial and\
    \ water resources. For the farmer of the CBEC pilot, the advantages are\nrelated\
    \ to the possibility of achieving water savings and experimenting with new approaches\
    \ based\non scientiﬁc methods. The two açaí palm farmers stated that the advantages\
    \ of adoption are mainly\nrelated to the possibility of reducing both the use\
    \ of water and electricity. Regarding the information\nthe farmer considers necessary\
    \ to adopt sensors and drones, farmer B cited especially the daily water\nrequirement\
    \ since there are no available scientiﬁc studies to be used as guidance. It is\
    \ important to\nknow the equipment and electricity costs, according to farmer\
    \ C.\nRegarding irrigation planning, in the MATOPIBA pilot, the water requirement\
    \ is estimated\nbased on the weather forecast, soil moisture and ﬁeld capacity,\
    \ evapotranspiration (obtained through\na weather station located on the farm),\
    \ crop demand according to the crop stage and a manual\ncheck. The irrigation\
    \ time is estimated based on the electricity cost, which deﬁnes the turning-on\n\
    time (around 9:00 pm) and the turning-oﬀ time (around 6:00 am) of the pivots.\
    \ In the CBEC pilot,\nthe water requirement for irrigation is deﬁned through the\
    \ CRITERIA model, based on water balance,\nprovided by the ARPAE regional agency,\
    \ since tools for the collection of these data are not available in\nfarms [99,100].\
    \ The irrigation time is decided by the farmer based on his experience. Regarding\
    \ açaí\npalm farms, a scientiﬁc reference study is not available for the estimation\
    \ of the irrigation requirement.\nAll producers known to the farmers B and C adopt\
    \ a requirement equal to 120 liters per day per açaí\nplant. Such practices came\
    \ from native people from the north of Brazil and have no scientiﬁc support\n\
    or further studies. When açaí crops are irrigated, farmer B and C will consider\
    \ this requirement as\na reference.\nAs for irrigation control, the farm manager\
    \ of the MATOPIBA pilot manually analyzes the soil\nmoisture. He tries to perform\
    \ night irrigation, which is cheaper (at night, irrigation costs are 10 times\n\
    lower than during the day). He stated: “Night irrigation is what makes the business\
    \ feasible”. The pivot\ncontrol system generates reports and indicators to evaluate\
    \ the eﬃciency of irrigation. The Italian\nfarmer controls the irrigation exclusively\
    \ by his own experience. Both farmers B and C use the\nexperience and information\
    \ shared with other farmers to control visually and manually the irrigation.\n\
    For the farm manager from MATOPIBA pilot, the main changes are managerial, in\
    \ terms of\ntraining to learn about the new tools and to know how to read the\
    \ data correctly, to support the\ndecision-making process. In this pilot, the\
    \ main challenge is the decision about where to irrigate,\nbased on IoT sensing\
    \ technology of soil probe and therefore implement variable rate irrigation.\n\
    This allows zone management, which must be described in the geographic information\
    \ system, in order\nto obtain the water requirement in the form of an irrigation\
    \ prescription map. The key challenge of\nthe CBEC pilot is to calculate the irrigation\
    \ requirement through the use of the CRITERIA model\nconsidering the real requests\
    \ from the ﬁeld, according to a water balance approach. The adoption of\nUAV is\
    \ being tested to check the model estimation and to reﬁne the plant parameters.\
    \ The use of a\nmultispectral camera allows collecting data fundamental to calculate\
    \ the NDVI and the LAI [39,54,55].\nTherefore, the LAI estimation, currently based\
    \ on literature data, will be improved, thanks to the data\ncollected through\
    \ the UAV. As for the two açaí palm farms, both farmers B and C are involved in\
    \ an\nongoing irrigation project for açaí cultivation and are interested in experimenting\
    \ with innovative\ntechnologies for irrigation.\n4.3. Modelling of Irrigation\
    \ Operations Management\nAs a result of the factors identiﬁed whit the related\
    \ work, expert interviews and case studies,\na model of irrigation operations\
    \ management through IDEF0 is proposed, combining concepts of IoT,\nPA, Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, TPB, irrigation and operations management. This model, built using the\
    \ approach\nproposed by [87], supports the formulation of the simulation scenarios\
    \ and the development of theory\non the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. The context diagram of irrigation operations\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n\

    \ of irrigation operations management. \nFigure 5. IDEF0 diagram of irrigation\
    \ operations management.\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n16 of 32\nThe irrigation planning\
    \ produces the irrigation water requirements [39,41,55,91], the irrigation\ntime\
    \ [101] and the ﬁelds to irrigate [102]. Farm planning involves several seasonal\
    \ decisions that the\nfarmer must make, such as determining the crops to be grown,\
    \ the area to be used for each crop,\nthe irrigation policy [103], including irrigation\
    \ strategies [92]. The seasonal nature of the operations\nis one of the main characteristics\
    \ that diﬀerentiate agriculture from industry, as highlighted by the\nexpert B:\
    \ “We work in the agricultural cycle, you have the right time to plant and if\
    \ you make a mistake,\nyou have committed a whole harvest. Agriculture is a window,\
    \ so this must be done before, based on this\nwindow”. The inputs transformed\
    \ by irrigation planning are crop characteristics, weather data and\nsoil characteristics\
    \ [9,39,41,91,104,105]. The resources which perform the irrigation planning are\n\
    farmer or farm manager (depending on farm organization), farm characteristics\
    \ and IoT sensing\ntechnologies [9,39,52]. The farmer or farm manager supervises\
    \ all operations. The fundamental role\nof resources is highlighted by the expert\
    \ F: “For the planning of agricultural operations, the following\ninformation\
    \ is required: the necessary resources at the level of inputs (i.e., raw materials),\
    \ the hardware\n(i.e., what equipment you need), the resources of people (i.e.,\
    \ how many people are involved in this process)”.\nThe irrigation scheduling deﬁnes\
    \ which farm resources must be allocated. Farm resources to\nbe allocated are\
    \ men and machinery [106] and irrigation system resources, which depend on farm\n\
    characteristics and crop type, such as valves and pumps [101,102,107], central\
    \ pivots [102], river, well,\nspring, canals, reservoir, drip irrigation system).\
    \ As an example, the farm manager of the MATOPIBA\npilot explained: “In the farm,\
    \ there is a river, which is the water source for the farm irrigation. The two\
    \ nearest\npivots are supplied by electrical pumps, including the pilot pivot.\
    \ The other pivots are supplied through a reservoir\nlocated in the middle of\
    \ the farm. The water is taken by electrical pumps to this reservoir, which distributes\n\
    the water to the other more distant pivots”. The irrigation scheduling also produces\
    \ a reservation in\nthe tuple < operation, time window, resources > and a sequence\
    \ of the operations to be performed [68].\nAn example can be illustrated with\
    \ the MATOPIBA pilot, in which the operation “irrigation execution”,\nusing the\
    \ resource “central pivot 8”, is carried out in the time window “beginning at\
    \ 21:00 h on day\n1 and ending at 6:00 h on day 2”. Irrigation scheduling procedures\
    \ can include which crop should\nreceive priority when allocating water during\
    \ the next irrigation turn [108], priority rules based on\nmanagement objectives\
    \ [34]. An example of a priority rule is the minimization of the energy cost\n\
    compared to water use. In the case of the MATOPIBA pilot, this rule determines\
    \ the nightly execution\nof the irrigation. Another example is the possibility\
    \ of a switch on/oﬀ a pump/valve when the water\nlevel applied to the ﬁeld reaches\
    \ some predeﬁned threshold value [101].\nThe irrigation execution concerns the\
    \ realization of scheduled operations [68,109]. Activating the\nscheduled resources\
    \ in the context of Agriculture 4.0 is automatic, according to the expert H: “The\
    \ entire\nprocess is done automatically, which reduces labor work. You don’t have\
    \ to turn on the pivot, you don’t have\nto turn on the irrigation system under\
    \ the surface of the soil”. Water for irrigation can be considered\nunlimited\
    \ and limited, depending on the amount of water available for irrigation or the\
    \ capacity of\nthe water distribution system [110]. The irrigation execution outputs\
    \ are the ﬁnal irrigation status\nand the following performance measures: water\
    \ use, water use eﬃciency, water cost and energy cost.\nThe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ which can be deﬁned and measured in diﬀerent ways [111], is inﬂuenced by\nseveral\
    \ factors, such as the timing and the quantity of water applied during irrigation,\
    \ the losses along\nwith the water distribution and the type of irrigation technique\
    \ [40].\nIrrigation control receives, as inputs, the outputs from the other functions\
    \ and the control\ncommands from resources allocated [10,107,112,113]. Irrigation\
    \ control monitors the irrigation system\nand resources allocated, through their\
    \ identiﬁcation, operation, location and status [10], based on\nirrigation control\
    \ procedures. This possibility of controlling irrigation operations through IoT\
    \ sensing\ntechnologies, like soil probes, can aﬀect Agriculture 4.0 adoption,\
    \ as stated by expert F: “The control\nwould be much easier thanks to the use\
    \ of sensors, in the context of IoT for irrigation, for example checking if\n\
    that plant needs water, nutrients”. This will improve the visual inspection based\
    \ on experience carried\nout by farmers A, B and C. Moreover, expert B added that\
    \ the adoption of PA in the context of\nAgriculture 4.0 would allow monitoring\
    \ exactly how much water, where, in which way, at what time,\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 7091\n17 of 32\nin what location. This control will overcome the risks of under\
    \ and over-irrigation, as reported by [9].\nIrrigation control monitors irrigation\
    \ status, based on information received from planning, scheduling\nand execution\
    \ operations, to provide feedback to the other functions [34,87,114]. Irrigation\
    \ control also\nallows calculating performance measures, in addition to results\
    \ directly related to the use of water\nand energy provided by the irrigation\
    \ execution. Like in the manufacturing sector, agricultural farms\nshould initiate\
    \ key performance indicators for monitoring and reviewing the performance [97].\
    \ This is\nhighlighted by the expert F: “Traditional industrial indicators, such\
    \ as eﬃciency, productivity, capacity,\navailability, can be calculated and used,\
    \ as in factory operations”. Expert G added: “I believe that in the\nfuture the\
    \ movement 4.0 will bring some close developments, for example, greater reliability,\
    \ greater precision,\ngreater productivity and, an issue that is very present\
    \ in the industry, greater traceability”. Irrigation control\nprocedures concern\
    \ control information for carrying out irrigation operations. An example of the\n\
    procedure concerns the irrigation water requirement and irrigation time. In line\
    \ with the industrial\nmodel, if the actual values of these planned outputs deviate\
    \ from the expected value, feedback is sent\nto the function irrigation planning\
    \ [32,115] for reevaluating the existing irrigation programs [110].\nAnother example\

    \ Operations Management\nThe proposed model of irrigation operations management\
    \ provides an initial framework to\nstudy the identiﬁed factors, the relationships\
    \ among them and, consequently, the adoption of PA\nin the context of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. The ﬁrst application of this framework aimed to evaluate the\ncause–eﬀect\
    \ relationships among some factors involved in irrigation planning, is presented\
    \ in this\nsection, which illustrates the results of the simulations performed\
    \ with MATOPIBA pilot, considering the\ncrop type soybean and the “central pivot\
    \ 8”. These simulations use the IDEF0 modeling shown in\nFigure 6.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, x \n17 of 32 \n \nas reported by [9]. Irrigation control monitors irrigation\
    \ status, based on information received from \nplanning, scheduling and execution\
    \ operations, to provide feedback to the other functions [34,87,114]. \nIrrigation\
    \ control also allows calculating performance measures, in addition to results\
    \ directly related \nto the use of water and energy provided by the irrigation\
    \ execution. Like in the manufacturing sector, \nagricultural farms should initiate\
    \ key performance indicators for monitoring and reviewing the \nperformance [97].\
    \ This is highlighted by the expert F: “Traditional industrial indicators, such\
    \ as efficiency, \nproductivity, capacity, availability, can be calculated and\
    \ used, as in factory operations”. Expert G added: “I \nbelieve that in the future\
    \ the movement 4.0 will bring some close developments, for example, greater reliability,\
    \ \ngreater precision, greater productivity and, an issue that is very present\
    \ in the industry, greater traceability”. \nIrrigation control procedures concern\
    \ control information for carrying out irrigation operations. An \nexample of\
    \ the procedure concerns the irrigation water requirement and irrigation time.\
    \ In line with \nthe industrial model, if the actual values of these planned outputs\
    \ deviate from the expected value, \nfeedback is sent to the function irrigation\
    \ planning [32,115] for reevaluating the existing irrigation \nprograms [110].\
    \ Another example involves the information for maintaining the soil moisture content\
    \ \nbetween the field capacity and the permanent wilting point, in the case of\
    \ IoT sensing technology of \nsoil probe [104]. \n4.4. Simulations: Application\
    \ of the Model of Irrigation Operations Management \nThe proposed model of irrigation\
    \ operations management provides an initial framework to \nstudy the identified\
    \ factors, the relationships among them and, consequently, the adoption of PA\
    \ in \nthe context of Agriculture 4.0. The first application of this framework\
    \ aimed to evaluate the cause–\neffect relationships among some factors involved\
    \ in irrigation planning, is presented in this section, \nwhich illustrates the\
    \ results of the simulations performed with MATOPIBA pilot, considering the \n\
    crop type soybean and the “central pivot 8”. These simulations use the IDEF0 modeling\
    \ shown in \nFigure 6. \n \nFigure 6. IDEF0 diagram of irrigation planning relative\

    \ planning can be decomposed into three \noperations: reference evapotranspiration\
    \ determination, crop water requirements estimation and \nirrigation water requirements\
    \ estimation been represented by the respective IDEF0 functions. \nThe reference\
    \ evapotranspiration determination produces the \U0001D438\U0001D447௢  parameter.\

    \ Simulations of Scenarios S1.1 and S1.2\nThe ﬁrst simulation (S1.1) performed\
    \ uses the reference evapotranspiration provided by the\nweather station as well\
    \ as the crop coeﬃcients of soybeans to produce the crop water requirements\n\
    (using Equation (2)). The eﬀective rainfall from the weather station is used to\
    \ produce irrigation water\nneeds (using Equation (3)).\nIn the charts in Figure\
    \ 7a, irrigation water requirements follow the variability of rainfall and crop\n\
    water requirements on each growth stage. Despite this, the irrigation recommended\
    \ in the ﬁrst and\nlast stages was 0 mm. The results on these stages can be explained\
    \ by the low crop water requirements,\nwhich is supplied by the high amount of\
    \ eﬀective rainfall.\nThe simulation considering the SAT parameter (S1.2), shown\
    \ in the chart in Figure 7b, had an\nincrease of 6.81% in the total amount of\
    \ water used on the initial growth stage. The chart in Figure 7b\nshows that the\
    \ crop water requirements chart represents the soil evaporation in the stage before\
    \ sowing\nand has a decrease when the curve embodies the crop water requirements\
    \ at the beginning of the ﬁrst\nstage in the ﬁrst month of growing.\n4.4.2. Simulations\
    \ of Scenarios S2.1 and S2.2\nOn the simulations S2.1 and S2.2, the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration is determined using the weather\ndata from the local water\
    \ station (using Equation (1)) and the crop coeﬃcients of soybeans to produce\n\
    the crop water requirements (using Equation (2)). The irrigation water requirements\
    \ are obtained\nthrough eﬀective rainfall and crop water requirements (using Equation\
    \ (3)).\nThe results shown in the chart in Figure 7c reveal an increase of 119.93%\
    \ of the total amount\nof water used in irrigation, compared with the S1.1 simulation,\
    \ where no irrigation water is used\nin the initial and ﬁnal stages. This is explained\
    \ with the reference evapotranspiration parameter,\nwhich had its values increased\
    \ by 61.51%, compared with the simulation S1.1. The rising of the\nreference evapotranspiration\
    \ leads to an increment in crop water requirements. Once the precipitation\ndoes\
    \ not supply the increase in crop water requirements, it will lead to more irrigation\
    \ water.\nThe simulation S2.2, which uses the SAT parameter, increased 3.10% compared\
    \ with the S2.1\nsimulation in the total amount of irrigation water. The following\
    \ stages had the same behavior\nvariability of S2.1 simulation.\n4.4.3. Simulations\
    \ of Scenarios S3.1 and S3.2\nThe simulation S3.1 uses the climatic parameters\
    \ obtained from the satellite estimated weather data\nto determine the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration (using Equation (1)) and the crop water requirements\n(using\
    \ Equation (2)). Using the eﬀective rainfall from the same IoT sensing technology,\
    \ the irrigation\nwater requirements are determined (using Equation (3)).\nThe\
    \ results of the S3.1 simulation is close to those of the S1.1, as shown in Table\
    \ 7, in which a\ndiﬀerence of 0.96 mm of the total amount of irrigation water\
    \ was found. The chart in Figure 7e shows\nthat the variation of the parameters\
    \ measured and IoT sensing technologies adopted contributes to\nthe variability\
    \ of the chart variability of reference evapotranspiration and crop water requirements,\n\
    in which a diﬀerence of 180.05 mm and 256.08 mm, respectively, was found.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 7091\n20 of 32\nThe results of simulations 3.1 and 3.2, shown in charts\
    \ (e) and (f) of Figure 7, also highlight that\nthe rainfall is overestimated\
    \ when compared with the precipitation obtained from the weather station\non simulations\
    \ S1.1, S1.2, S2.1 and S2.2. The simulation S3.2 uses 7.33% more water than the\
    \ simulation\nS3.1. Water used in the stage before sowing presents a result slightly\
    \ higher than simulations S1.2 and\nS2.2, due to the overestimation of precipitation\
    \ in that period. However, the simulations S3.1 and S3.2\nhave the same variability\
    \ along the crop growth stages.\n5. Discussion\nWithin this section, the results\
    \ and their contributions are discussed, starting with relevant\nfactors for the\
    \ adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0. Afterward, the proposed model\
    \ of\nirrigation operations management based on IDEF0 and the results of simulations\
    \ are discussed. Finally,\nlimitations of the study and future research are presented.\n\
    5.1. Relevant Factors for the Adoption of PA in the Context of Agriculture 4.0\
    \ and the Key Role of IoT\nThis work contributes to current knowledge on Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, proposing a list of categories and\nfactors that can aﬀect the adoption\
    \ of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0 through empirical research.\nThe main\
    \ categories that drive the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0,\
    \ focusing on\nfarmer behavior and operations management are performance measurement,\
    \ access to data, operations\nplanning and control, farm characteristics. These\
    \ categories and related factors, such as water use,\nenergy cost, irrigation\
    \ water requirement, irrigation planning, irrigation control, can inﬂuence the\n\
    perception of the farmer in the evaluation of the investigated behavior and therefore\
    \ impact his intention\nto adopt it. In line with [19], the domain-speciﬁc factors\
    \ are important to gain a complete understanding\nof the behavior under consideration.\
    \ In this study, these factors are: farm size, methods to estimate\nthe reference\
    \ evapotranspiration, methods to crop water requirement estimation, crop characteristics,\n\
    weather data, soil characteristics, farm resources, crop growth stages, farm planning,\
    \ crop yield,\nwater use eﬃciency, irrigation planning, irrigation control, in\
    \ the agriculture domain; scheduling,\nresources to be allocated, farm resources\
    \ allocated, reservation, the sequence of operations, performance\nmeasures, in\
    \ the operations management domain; IoT sensing technologies and parameters measured\n\
    through these technologies, in the IoT domain.\nThe greater the perception of\
    \ the farmer regarding the beneﬁts he can obtain (such as reduction of\nwater\
    \ use, reduction of energy costs, improvement of decision-making process relating\
    \ to irrigation\nplanning, scheduling and control), the more favorable the attitude\
    \ of the farmer and consequently\nstronger his intention to adopt the PA in the\
    \ context of Agriculture 4.0. Furthermore, the lower the\nperception of the farmer\
    \ concerning obstacles, such as competency in managing the agricultural\noperations\
    \ as reported by many experts, and the more resources the farmer believes he possesses,\n\
    like IoT sensing technologies, the greater is his perceived control and consequently\
    \ stronger his\nintention to adopt the PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0.\n\
    This work contributes to the progress of knowledge on Agriculture 4.0, proposing\
    \ a list of factors\nrelated to farmer behavior and operations management, as\
    \ a result of empirical research in four farms\nwith diﬀerent size, organization\
    \ and irrigation technique, and overcoming the limit that Agriculture\n4.0 is\
    \ still restricted and put oﬀ in theory [15]. The empirical ﬁndings contribute\
    \ to answering the\nsuggestion of [16] regarding a more in-depth analysis needed\
    \ to understand what Agriculture 4.0\nis and also to include the perspective of\
    \ operations management in the Agriculture 4.0 deﬁnition.\nIn line with the deﬁnition\
    \ of precision agriculture [48], the deﬁnition of IoT of [116], the deﬁnition\
    \ of\nAgriculture 4.0 formulated by [16], shown in Table 8, and the IoT sensing\
    \ technologies presented in\nTable 1, the Agriculture 4.0 in this work is:\nSensors\

    \ IoT and Agriculture 4.0.\nDeﬁnition of PA [48]\nDeﬁnition of IoT [116]\nDeﬁnition\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0 [16]\nPrecision agriculture is a\nmanagement strategy that\
    \ gathers,\nprocesses and analyzes temporal,\nspatial and individual data and\n\
    combines it with other information\nto support management decisions\naccording\
    \ to estimated variability\nfor improved resource use eﬃciency,\nproductivity,\
    \ quality, proﬁtability\nand sustainability of\nagricultural production.\nInternet\

    \ of applications\ninvolving at the same virtual level\nboth people and representations\n\
    of objects.\nAgriculture 4.0 is the evolution of\nprecision agriculture, realized\n\
    through the automated collection,\nintegration and analysis of\npreviously separated\
    \ data silos\ncoming from the ﬁeld, equipment\nsensors and other third-party\n\
    sources, enabled by the use of smart\nand digital technologies of Industry\n4.0,\
    \ making in this way possible the\ngeneration of knowledge, to support\nthe farmer\
    \ in the decision-making\nprocess in the farm enterprise.\n“a management strategy,\
    \ evolution of precision agriculture, realized through the automated collection,\n\

    \ IoT sensing technologies\nand farm resources, making in this way possible the\
    \ generation of knowledge, to support the design of\napplications for the farmer\
    \ decision-making process in irrigation operations management”.\nThe interconnection\
    \ of IoT sensing technologies (such as satellite databases, weather station,\n\
    soil probes, UAV) and farm resources (such as pumps, central pivots and valves)\
    \ supports the design of\napplications, like an estimation of crop water requirement,\
    \ allocation of farm resources, the deﬁnition\nof irrigation operations sequence,\
    \ control of irrigation status and calculation of performance measures.\nThese\
    \ applications allow the farmer to make decisions concerning planning, scheduling,\
    \ execution\nand control of irrigation. This deﬁnition highlights the key role\
    \ of IoT in the evolution of precision\nagriculture towards Agriculture 4.0.\n\
    5.2. Proposed Model of Irrigation Operations Management\nThe identiﬁed factors\
    \ allow to understand the management of irrigation operations and formalize\n\
    it in a model, using the IDEF0 methodology. Considering the lack of theory on\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 [15,16],\nthis model contributes to the current level of knowledge\
    \ on Agriculture 4.0, proposing relationships\namong those factors in order to\
    \ explain the adoption of precision agriculture in the context of\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0. These relationships were identiﬁed during the construction of the model,\
    \ decomposed\ninto four functions illustrated in Figure 5: irrigation planning,\
    \ irrigation scheduling, irrigation execution\nand irrigation control.\nIn contrast\
    \ to previous research on agriculture, the proposed model distinguishes between\n\
    planning and scheduling. Considering terminological aspects [33], planning and\
    \ scheduling can\nhave a diﬀerent meaning in the literature. Some authors use\
    \ irrigation scheduling to indicate how\nmuch irrigation water has to be given\
    \ to the crop and how often or when this water is given [91],\nto meet a speciﬁed\
    \ management objective [112] and based on diﬀerent approaches (e.g., soil water\n\
    measurement, soil water balance calculations, plant stress sensing) [117]. Some\
    \ authors use irrigation\nplanning for referring to the planning horizon. According\
    \ to [110], irrigation planning refers to\nseasonal irrigation, with irrigation\
    \ execution in terms of days since planting time. [118] refer to\nshort-term planning\
    \ (7–14 days) for the estimation of irrigation water demand and rainfall in the\n\
    irrigation season. [119] diﬀerentiate between irrigation planning over a time\
    \ horizon that is usually\nlong and a water distribution schedule that is usually\
    \ daily. Recently [68] introduced a diﬀerentiation\nin agricultural operations\
    \ management about planning and scheduling. The planning determines\nwhich operations\
    \ to execute and with what resources, while the scheduling determines the times\
    \ for\nexecuting the selected operations.\nIn contrast, in a manufacturing system,\
    \ the planning involves the determination of the type\nand amount of products\
    \ to be produced in a future time frame, while the scheduling involves\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 7091\n22 of 32\nthe allocation of operations to the resources along\
    \ with the speciﬁc start and ﬁnish times in each\nperiod [32]. The allocation\
    \ decisions for the production resources are the primary focus of the\nproduction\
    \ scheduling [120]. Therefore, the proposed model distinguishes between irrigation\
    \ planning\nand irrigation scheduling in line with the literature on IDEF0 [32–34]\
    \ and the quotes of experts A, E\nand F. This model complements the recent work\
    \ of [68] who do not concentrate their study on irrigation\noperations management.\
    \ The framework of the four-function model highlights the resources involved\n\
    in each function, their role in performing the operations, the interfaces between\
    \ the functions in terms\nof inputs and outputs, the rules governing the execution\
    \ of operations. An example to illustrate this\ndiﬀerence is the MATOPIBA pilot.\
    \ As a result of the simulation illustrated in the chart of Figure 7a,\nthe farm\
    \ manager receives the information that the irrigation time, relative to the “central\
    \ pivot 8”\nstudied, is equal to November and December of 2019 and January of\
    \ 2020. Regarding the irrigation\nscheduling, the function depicted in Figure\
    \ 5, on the ﬁrst day of November 2019, informs the farm\nmanager that the “central\
    \ pivot 8” will be activated in the time window “beginning at 21:00 on the ﬁrst\n\
    day of November 2019 and ending at 6:00 on the second day of November 2019, based\
    \ on irrigation\nscheduling procedures. This scheduling is replicated for all\
    \ the days in the irrigation time.\nThe model of irrigation operations management\
    \ also answers to the suggestion of [21], as the\nanalysis carried out can facilitate\
    \ the establishment of operational solutions to explain the unexplored\npotential\
    \ of PA in agricultural operations. The inspiration for Industry 4.0 led to consider\
    \ some\nadvantages that can be introduced in agriculture, such as improvements\
    \ in planning and control,\nwhich is related to one of the key categories (operations\
    \ planning and control) of the proposed model.\nIn addition, the formulation of\
    \ the model includes the factors associated with the challenges analyzed\nin Section\
    \ 2.3. Regarding the interaction between agricultural ﬁeld operations and biologically\
    \ active\nsystems [21], the sensing technologies allow monitoring the development\
    \ of the crop along the\ngrowth stages, thus mitigating the risk and uncertainty\
    \ relating to operating in a biologically active\nenvironment. In this way, the\
    \ farmer will be able to make decisions, also considering this challenging\nfactor.\
    \ Data collected by IoT sensing technologies of weather station and satellite\
    \ can be used to\nsupport the farmer decision-making process challenged by uncertainty\
    \ and risk relating to operating\nin a biologically active environment, as shown\
    \ during simulations carried out. As for the mobility\ndegree of production facilities\
    \ [17], this factor seems to be not challenging in irrigation planning,\nbut its\
    \ inﬂuence on irrigation execution and irrigation control should be investigated\
    \ in future research,\nas well as the availability and bandwidth of wireless connections.\n\
    The exploration of the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0 of this\
    \ work leads to expand\nthe possibilities of the IoT in the domain of PA since\
    \ the IoT can also be studied concerning the operation’s\nmanagement. The availability\
    \ and adoption of diﬀerent IoT sensing technologies allow managing\nirrigation\
    \ operations in terms of access to data, planning and control of operations, performance\n\
    measures, compared with the current management in the farms studied. Furthermore,\
    \ the focus on\nfarmer behavior and on his perceptions, related to the advantages\
    \ and disadvantages of adopting these\nIoT sensing technologies, allows developing\
    \ these possibilities according to farmer needs.\n5.3. Relationships Among Identiﬁed\
    \ Factors in the Proposed Model\nThe simulation results evidence the relationships\
    \ among some factors involved in irrigation\nplanning and, therefore, to study\
    \ the parameters related to these factors. These ﬁndings contribute to\nthe development\
    \ of the theory on Agriculture 4.0 and to a better understanding of what Agriculture\n\
    4.0 is [15,16].\nThe simulation investigates the relationship among some factors,\
    \ shown in Figure 5, encoded in\nthe categories “access to data” (crop characteristics,\
    \ weather data and soil characteristics), “operations\nplanning and control” (irrigation\
    \ planning, irrigation time, irrigation water requirement, farm resources,\nIoT\
    \ sensing technologies). The simulation ﬁndings explain the cause–eﬀect relationships\
    \ among the\nparameters related to these factors and the irrigation planning outputs.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 7091\n23 of 32\nIn line with the literature [39,42,44], reference\
    \ evapotranspiration plays an essential role in\nirrigation planning. The simulations\
    \ results suggest that IoT sensing technologies of the weather\nstation and satellite\
    \ with diﬀerent measured parameters, as shown in Table 7, aﬀect the results of\
    \ the\nFAOPM model in the same geolocation, changing both the crop water requirements\
    \ and irrigation\nwater needs variations.\nAs stated by authors as [42,44,121,122],\
    \ the application of the FAOPM model using more measured\nparameters can lead\
    \ to best performances in the determination of reference evapotranspiration\n\
    compared with calculation with estimated parameters. This has an impact on the\
    \ beneﬁts perceived\nby the farmer in the use of these models [75] and consequently\
    \ has an impact on his intention to\nadopt Agriculture 4.0. However, the FAOPM\
    \ model, using more measured parameters, can lead to\nthe challenge highlighted\
    \ by the expert L: “The planning of operations is a complex process and the more\n\
    data the farmer has, the more he needs to set up a process with less error”. This\
    \ challenge is reported by [18],\nwho states that data by its nature in an Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 scenario become complex to manage both in\nterms of size and complexity\
    \ of the analysis to be carried out. This challenge, however, requires future\n\
    research to study in greater depth the relationships between the factors involved.\
    \ Notwithstanding,\nresearchers as [121,122] elaborate that temperature and radiation\
    \ are promising parameters to estimate\nde reference evapotranspiration. However,\
    \ new models must be studied to perform a better or equal\nprecision of the FAOPM\
    \ and to investigate the relative impact on the adoption of precision agriculture\n\
    in the context of Agriculture 4.0.\nThe sensibility of satellite-based solutions\
    \ have to cloud levels [55,123,124], and the questionable\nresults of the use\
    \ of air humidity, wind speed, and precipitation retrieved from the NASA/POWER\n\
    gridded weather dataset [56] suggest some disadvantages of satellite-based solutions.\
    \ However, gridded\nweather databases provide applicable temperature and radiation\
    \ parameters [56], making room for\nfuture research of models that combine IoT\
    \ sensing technologies shown in Table 1 and the proposed\nmodel of irrigation\
    \ planning. Another advantage related to IoT sensing technology of satellite is\
    \ its\napplicability to irrigation planning applications [125] and its high spatial\
    \ resolution compared with\nthe weather stations [39] been suitable to small farmers,\
    \ such as the two açaí palm producers. Thus,\nfuture research is needed to investigate\
    \ the adoption of IoT sensing technology of satellite in regions\nwith high cloudiness\
    \ like Pará in Brazil.\nThis work also contributes to Agriculture 4.0 discussion,\
    \ since the possibility the farmer must use\ndiﬀerent methods to estimate the\
    \ reference evapotranspiration and the crop water requirement and to\nadopt IoT\
    \ sensing technologies that improve access to data and the operations planning,\
    \ in line with\nliterature on Agriculture 4.0 [17]. Consequently, Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 enables the farmer to strengthen the\ndecision-making process transforming\
    \ the traditional operating model, often experience-based, to a\ndigital data-intensive\
    \ one [69]. Decision-making mechanism is expected to be a complex mix of human\n\
    and computer factors in the future [126], mitigating the challenge posed by Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 to farmers\nwhich lies in the interaction with ICT without necessarily being\
    \ experts in the digital domain, but used\nto “understand” the crop behavior by\
    \ experience and simple tools [127].\n5.4. Limitations and Further Research\n\
    The simulation ﬁndings represent the ﬁrst application of the proposed list of\
    \ factors and model\nof irrigation operations management, depicted in this work.\
    \ However, some limitations should be\nconsidered and addressed in future studies,\
    \ considering the exploratory nature of this study.\nThis work, carried out as\
    \ part of the SWAMP project, involved the MATOPIBA pilot in Brazil and\none of\
    \ the three farms of the CBEC pilot. Moreover, interviews with experts were conducted\
    \ in Brazil.\nTo increase the external validity of the results obtained, the multimethod\
    \ approach of this study will be\napplied to the other farms involved in the SWAMP\
    \ project, and interviews will also be conducted with\nexperts in Italy.\nRegarding\
    \ the relevant factors for the adoption of precision agriculture in the context\
    \ of Agriculture\n4.0, the TPB predictor “subjective norm” was considered out\
    \ of scope. Future research is necessary to\nSensors 2020, 20, 7091\n24 of 32\n\
    include this predictor in the exploration and to investigate the relationship\
    \ between the actors operating\nin the farm ecosystem (for example, the Consorzio\
    \ di Boniﬁca Centrale in the Italian pilot) and the\nfarmer. Future research will\
    \ also focus on studying the factors identiﬁed through semi-structured\ninterviews\
    \ and considered out of scope (such as access to the market of technologies, access\
    \ to the\nmarket of ﬁnancial resources and access to the market of education)\
    \ and their impact on the adoption.\nTo a holistic insight, the system dynamics\
    \ simulation technique will also be applied.\nThe model of irrigation operations\
    \ management is proposed as a framework for directing future\nstudies aimed at\
    \ investigating the cause–eﬀect relationships among the parameters relative to\
    \ the\nidentiﬁed factors involved in the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Therefore, a research\ntopic will be promoted to develop a theory on Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, which in the future will be extended to\nother agricultural operations\
    \ in addition to irrigation. Since the IDEF0 methodology is also used for\nthe\
    \ design of new systems, the proposed model will guide the design of a support\
    \ system for irrigation\nplanning, scheduling and control.\nRegarding the relationships\
    \ among the identiﬁed factors in the proposed model, simulations\nwere carried\
    \ out to compare the IoT sensing technologies of weather station and satellite.\
    \ To choose\nwhich is the best method for estimating the irrigation water requirement,\
    \ it is necessary to study the\nrelationship also with crop yield, as well as\
    \ with the water use. Therefore, future research will be\ncarried out through\
    \ ﬁeld experiments, considering IoT sensing technologies, such as soil probes\
    \ and\nUAV and other crop types, also in order to evaluate the impact of temporal\
    \ and spatial variability on\nthe adoption.\n6. Conclusions\nThe aims of this\
    \ work were to explore the factors that can aﬀect the adoption of precision agriculture\n\
    in the context of Agriculture 4.0, proposing a model to understand and formalize\
    \ agricultural operations\nmanagement based on identiﬁed factors and performing\
    \ simulation scenarios to study the relationships\namong the identiﬁed factors.\
    \ Some research gaps were identiﬁed following the related work. To address\nthese\
    \ gaps, a multimethod approach consisting of interviews with experts, case studies,\
    \ modeling\ntechniques and simulation was adopted. Findings from empirical research\
    \ supported the identiﬁcation\nof a list of categories and factors that can aﬀect\
    \ the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0,\nthe formalization of\
    \ these categories and factors in a model of irrigation operations management,\n\
    the execution of the simulation scenarios to study the relationships among some\
    \ factors involved in\nirrigation planning.\nConsidering the current development\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0 concepts, this work makes a theoretical\ncontribution, proposing\
    \ a list of factors related to farmer behavior and operations management\nthat\
    \ drive the adoption of PA in the context of Agriculture 4.0. Furthermore, this\
    \ multidisciplinary\nresearch, bringing together the diﬀerent perspectives of\
    \ precision agriculture, IoT and operations\nmanagement, complements the extant\
    \ literature on Agriculture 4.0, mainly focused on automation,\nrobotics and sustainability.\n\
    This research also makes a contribution to Agriculture 4.0 discussion since the\
    \ possibility the\nfarmer must use diﬀerent methods to estimate the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration and the crop water\nrequirement and to adopt several IoT\
    \ sensing technologies allows to improve access to data and\nthe irrigation planning,\
    \ highlighting the key role of IoT in the evolution of the precision agriculture\n\
    towards the Agriculture 4.0.\nThe model of irrigation operations management is\
    \ proposed as a framework for directing\nfuture studies, involving the other farms\
    \ of the SWAMP project, the factors considered out of scope,\nother agricultural\
    \ operations in addition to irrigation, other crop types and the design of a support\n\
    system for irrigation planning, scheduling, execution and control.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\

    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\

    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\

    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    The variability of fresh water availability in arid and semi-arid countries poses
    a serious challenge to farmers to cope with when depending on irrigation for crop
    growing. This has shifted the focus onto improving irrigation management and water
    productivity (WP) through controlled deficit irrigation (DI). DI can be conceived
    as a strategy to deal with these challenges but more knowledge on risks and chances
    of this strategy is urgently needed. The availability of simulation models that
    can reliably predict crop yield under the influence of soil, atmosphere, irrigation,
    and agricultural management practices is a prerequisite for deriving reliable
    and effective deficit irrigation strategies. In this context, this article discusses
    the performance of the crop models CropWat, PILOTE, Daisy, and APSIM when being
    part of a stochastic simulation-based approach to improve WP by focusing primarily
    on the impact of climate variability. The stochastic framework consists of: (i)
    a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate variability; (ii)
    a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling
    with limited water supply; and (iii) the above mentioned models for simulating
    water transport and crop growth in a sound manner. The results present stochastic
    crop water production functions (SCWPFs) that can be used as basic tools for assessing
    the impact on the risk for the potential yield due to water stress and climate
    variability. Example simulations from India, Malawi, France and Oman are presented
    and the suitability of these crop models to be employed in a framework for optimizing
    WP is evaluated. Similar content being viewed by others Modelling impacts of precision

    that lack sufficient rainfall to sustain agriculture rely heavily on irrigation
    and thus other freshwater resources to water their lands. Water used for crop
    growing in arid and semi-arid environments can account for more than 90% (FAO
    2010) of the total freshwater supply making water a limited resource there. The
    variability of the water availability in these climates adds to the problem. Additional
    socio-economic pressure is being exerted through the current development in the
    world’s population. Hence strategies are needed that improve crop growth, make
    irrigation more efficient and sustainable as well as preserve farmland through
    better cultivation practices. This has led to a renewed interest in techniques
    to improve irrigation management as well as water use efficiency (WUE) or water
    productivity (WP) of irrigation systems. Molden et al. (2010) see great potential
    for improvements for irrigation through techniques such as water harvesting, supplemental
    irrigation, deficit irrigation (DI), precision irrigation techniques and soil-water
    conservation practices. Considerable improvements in WP are feasible in areas
    that suffer from imminent water scarcity, low productivity and high poverty, which
    is often accompanied by severe degradations of the ecosystem such as falling groundwater
    tables from excessive pumping. The preferred irrigation management practice in
    irrigated or rainfed systems that are only limited in land targets most likely
    at maximizing crop yields. With water being the limiting factor the benefits of
    a higher WP are that water and land resources are used more effectively. Fraiture
    and Wichelns (2010) consequently request to lower risks in rainfed agriculture
    by a better prediction of precipitation and, more importantly, by supplemental
    irrigation applications. Several definitions exist for WUE and WP depending on
    the area of operation. In general, WUE represents a gain (i.e. assimilated carbon,
    yield, biomass or others) over its expenses (i.e. irrigation water, transpiration
    sum, evapotranspiration). WUE could also be defined as how effectively provided
    irrigation water is used by crops (Molden et al. 2010). The term WP in the following
    is defined as crop yield per unit of depleted water but other expressions including
    monetary value are possible as summarized in Vazifedoust et al. (2008). Dealing
    with improvement of WP is closely related to the irrigation practice of regulated
    deficit irrigation where an intentional reduction in applied irrigation water
    would result in a yield drop. The ratio, however, would benefit from the cuts
    in water and yield with its productivity increasing to a certain point. More profound
    knowledge of DI is also needed to cope with severely limited water availability,
    e.g. during a drought. In such cases impacts by water stress on the yield cannot
    be avoided and DI could therefore be conceived as part of a strategy to minimize
    this impact on yield. Efforts to investigate WP are numerous and can mainly be
    divided into two groups; (a) field experiments which focus on crop growth and
    the evaluation of its effects on plants sustaining drought stress and (b) simulation-based
    studies where parameterized crop growth models that were calibrated and validated
    by appropriate field experiments in advance calculate the impacts of drought stress
    for a diverse range of environmental boundary conditions. A fairly comprehensive
    overview of conducted field experiments provide Geerts and Raes (2009) where investigations
    of different crops (among them maize, wheat and cotton) and their respective shapes
    of crop water production functions (CWPFs) are summarized. Additionally, advisable
    DI practices are presented. These vary within the crops without favoring an irrigation
    strategy in particular and reflect the diversity of genotypes of the investigated
    crops, the location they were grown at, and the crop development stages they sustained
    water stress. WP is governed by these factors and it becomes clear that mere crop
    growth experiments are not sufficient to explain the findings and therefore present
    no explicit solution on how to improve WP. Field experiments are in addition laborious
    and expensive and furthermore cannot account for all possible combinations of
    water stress or yield-affecting environmental boundary conditions. Pursuing a
    simulation-based approach to investigate and improve WP is another reasonable
    strategy. Khaledian et al. (2009) carried out a study where the applicability
    of the crop model PILOTE for corn and durum wheat under different direct seeding
    methods was investigated. The model was calibrated and validated against data
    of a 7-year trial in Mediterranean climate and the method “direct seeding into
    mulch” compared to conventional tillage. According to the authors PILOTE simulated
    leaf area index (LAI), soil water reserve, grain yield and dry matter for both
    methods satisfactorily. Potato under water saving regimes was investigated by
    Plauborg et al. (2010) where experimental data on transpiration and crop yield
    were compared to simulated results obtained by the model Daisy. The 2D soil water
    flow module was used and the model found to be capable of simulating the water
    saving effects of partial root zone drying compared to full irrigation treatments.
    The investigation concludes with the need for more experimental studies since
    simulated effects on crop yield and water use were negligible. Moore et al. (2011)
    applied a conceptual framework based on different water use efficiencies to evaluate
    the productivity and sustainability of fields in Australia that were comprised
    of wheat and different proportions of lucerne pastures by employing APSIM. Wang
    et al. (2009) simulated the productivity of wheat and the requirement of nitrogen
    under spatial climate effects with APSIM as well. In a study that focuses rather
    on hydraulics, Ismail et al. (2005) investigated the water productivity and yield
    production of Cotton grown in Egypt with CropWat. The model was used to determine
    whether optimal continuous flow or optimal surge flow is the more effective tool
    for irrigating short fields, which is the predominant field type in Egypt. The
    investigation was carried out by utilizing observed data of the amount of water
    stored in the ground along a furrow (and there distinguishing between beginning,
    middle and end section of the furrow) for the both flow types and their respective
    application efficiency into CropWat. The authors conclude that optimal surge flow
    resulted in higher crop yield. The applications of the simulation-based approach
    are limited since the variability of relevant climate factors (such as precipitation
    and temperature) and soil properties are not considered in many of the investigations.
    Studies carried out by (Semenov 2007), Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007), Soltani
    and Hoogenboom (2007), Gonzalez-Camacho et al. (2008), Garcia y Garcia et al.
    (2008), Tao et al. (2008) among others employ crop growth models to examine WP
    under the influence of climate variability and climate change but look only at
    rainfed or non irrigated sites or deal with full irrigation. Studies by Schütze
    and Schmitz (2010) and Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007) investigate deficit irrigation
    systems and the influence of climate variability on crop water production functions.
    Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007) employed data of climate change scenarios of
    the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to derive probability distribution
    functions of CWPF (CWPF-PDs). Schütze and Schmitz (2010) developed the concept
    further and proposed a stochastic framework in form of a planning tool for Optimal
    Climate Change Adaption Strategies for Irrigation (OCCASION) for generating site
    specific stochastic CWPF (SCWPF). In this context, this article discusses the
    performance of in total four crop models that are being subjected to a stochastic
    simulation-based approach to improve WP. The yields and corresponding water demands
    for different crops were calculated and their respective CWPFs generated by utilizing
    the stochastic framework OCCASION. Afterwards, the CWPFs were statistically analyzed
    and evaluated. The findings were used to test the crop models for their applicability
    within this framework. OCCASION was tested by Schütze and Schmitz (2010) and was
    found to be a valuable tool when investigating WP of irrigation systems and improving
    suchlike since stochastic water productivity function, profit function and water
    demand function can easily be derived from the generated SCWPF (Schütze et al.
    2011a). Furthermore, different crop models and consequently their locations of
    application were chosen to show that OCCASION can successfully be applied to a
    wide spectrum of crop growth models and for many environments suggesting a sound
    and robust approach to improve WP. 2 Materials and Methods The stochastic framework
    in which the crop models are implemented is discussed in Schütze and Schmitz (2010).
    Details about the working principle of OCCASION are therefore hereinafter summarized
    briefly. Based on Fig. 1, the stochastic framework consists of (i) a weather generator
    that provides a statistically sound number of site specific climate time series,
    (ii) a problem specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling under limiting
    water supply, and (iii) a crop model for simulating plant growth and water consumption.
    The application of OCCASION results in a number of site-specific CWPFs for a certain
    crop because of the number of climate time series used. These CWPFs are evaluated
    by means of descriptive statistical analysis and form the basis for the SCWPF.
    Fig. 1 The framework OCCASION for generating stochastic crop water production
    functions (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image The weather generator applied
    in OCCASION is LARS-WG (Semenov et al. 1998). Daily synthetic and statistically
    equal weather data of arbitrary length of global radiation, minimum and maximum
    temperatures, and precipitation from historical climate time series were created.
    Additionally, IPCC climate change scenarios for the year 2080 are implemented
    in the software and were considered. The optimization algorithm used in the framework
    (loop 1) is a problem specific evolutionary optimization algorithm named GET-OPTIS
    (Global Evolutionary Technique for Optimal Irrigation Scheduling) (Schütze et
    al. 2011b). Its structure differs in some aspects from conventional evolutionary
    algorithms by employing the steps selection, crossover, mutation, and recombination
    in that order. In conjunction with a crop model GET-OPTIS results in an irrigation
    schedule where the maximum yield per growing season by any given but limited amount
    of total irrigation water including application rates for each irrigation event
    is determined. SCWPF are then derived within three loops (see Fig. 1). The objective
    of loop 1 is to maximize the yield for one crop one climate time series and for
    a fixed amount of total irrigation water during that one growing cycle. With loop
    2, a complete CWPF is calculated by iterating through a range of available total
    irrigation water amounts. This CWPF represents the maximum yield that can be achieved
    with those amounts of total irrigation water available and can be viewed as the
    potential CWPF for a specific crop and for a specific climate time series. In
    loop 3, numerous CWPF are generated by iterating through all available synthetic
    climate time series. These are provided by the weather generator which can be
    interpreted as a Monte Carlo sampler. The resulting CWPFs are analyzed and the
    SCWPF obtained through parameters of descriptive statistics such as mean, median,
    quantiles and other moments. SCWPFs are empirical probability functions where
    for every value of applied irrigation water the marginal distribution function
    of the yield attached to it can be derived. Its quantiles can be understood as
    a reliability a certain yield can be achieved. The crop models investigated are
    CropWat, PILOTE, Daisy, and the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM).
    Except for APSIM, all models were calibrated by field experiments in advance to
    the optimization runs which were then carried out by only taking site specific
    data on meteorology and soil into account. Wind and relative humidity had to be
    excluded since the weather generator cannot determine those quantities. Soil salinity
    or other factors affecting crop growth were also not considered as well as possible
    different agricultural management practices. Instead, this investigation was kept
    as simple as possible in order to focus only on weather and climate variability
    and its effects on water consumption and crop yield. All water demands calculated
    are net amounts with irrigation efficiency assumed to be 100% (by reason of general
    applicability) and where applicable observed values were corrected prior to their
    use for calibration. In general, the irrigation efficiency is difficult to determine
    and has to be estimated. Three sources are feasible; from empirical studies such
    as provided by the FAO, from field experiments (Mailhol et al. 2011) or from simulation
    studies (Schmitz et al. 2002, 2007). 2.1 CropWat CropWat (Smith 1992) is an empirical
    decision support system developed by the Land and Water Division of the FAO and
    is well known to farmers for its easy estimation of crop water demands under different
    irrigation practices. The model considers climate, soil and crop data. The model
    is based on the FAO Irrigation and Drainage papers No. 56 “Crop evapotranspiration”
    and No. 33 “Yield response to water”, and for the latter its fundamental equation
    described by Jensen (1968) where the relative loss in yield is proportional to
    the relative reduction in evapotranspiration. The Penman-Monteith equation and
    respective crop coefficients are used to calculate evapotranspiration rates. Crop
    growth is simulated by the so-called linear model where gross dry matter production
    of a standard crop is empirical calculated and crop-dependent correction factors
    for climate, growth and yield are applied (Doorenbos et al. 1979). In this investigation
    a reimplementation of CropWat was used that calculated the soil water balance
    on a daily basis and was designed to run in batch mode. The model was applied
    in a study where the development of maize and wheat on a field in Kharagpur, India
    was investigated. The 17-year (1991 to 2007) climate time series consisted of
    weather records on rainfall, evaporation, relative humidity, maximum and minimum
    temperatures, wind speed and solar radiation. The climate in Kharagpur can be
    described as sub-humid and tropical with the growing season from September to
    March. 2.2 PILOTE PILOTE (Mailhol et al. 1997) is an empirical crop growth model
    for simulating plant development and calculating crop yield. The effects of water
    stress are taken into account by using a water stress index. The model follows
    a cascading layer approach for determining the water balance and is based on three
    soil water reservoirs. From these reservoirs, amongst others, water transport,
    evapotranspiration and plant available water content are managed. For yield calculations
    it is assumed that water is the only limiting factor and that all other variables
    meet plant requirements. The impacts of water deficit are considered by its effects
    on the LAI which in turn is governed by the water stress index. This water stress
    index accounts for reductions in evapotranspiration rates. The actual grain yield
    is calculated by the ratio of average LAI (affected by water availability) to
    optimal LAI (no water stress occurred). The final yield under non-water-limited
    conditions, which is also part of the equation, is determined by the harvest index
    and LAI-dependent intercepted solar radiation. The model operates on daily time
    steps. Further descriptions and examples for application can be found in Mailhol
    et al. (1997) and Khaledian et al. (2009), respectively. The development of maize
    grown on a sandy loam in the tropical continental climate of Bwanje, Malawi was
    investigated in conjunction with PILOTE. The model was parameterized with LAI
    and crop yield data to fit the observations of an irrigation scheme that was introduced
    to farmers to fight famine. The irrigation water was applied by furrow irrigation.
    Observed weather data of 35 years (1972 to 2006) were used to generate 400 climate
    time series in order to obtain the SWPF. In addition, the future climate change
    scenarios A2 and B1 for the year 2080 were included in this investigation. At
    the end, the effectiveness of the current irrigation practice was compared with
    the results of the optimized irrigation schedule. 2.3 Daisy Daisy (Abrahamsen
    and Hansen 2000) is a well-tested dynamic 1D soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer
    (SVAT) model comprising of the main modules bioclimate, vegetation and soil. These
    modules account for water balance, heat balance, solute balance and crop growth.
    The water balance module includes a surface and a soil water balance model where
    interception, evaporation, infiltration and surface run-off are considered for
    the former, and water transport in macropores as well as in the soil matrix for
    the latter. Root water uptake by plants is also regarded and modeled by a single
    root concept. Daisy calculates plant development through simulation of crop growth,
    photosynthesis, respiration and root water uptake. The development of the leaf
    area index is also considered. Driving variables are weather data of daily or
    hourly values of at least global radiation, temperature and precipitation. Adding
    values of relative humidity and wind speed is also possible. Crop growth is simulated
    by dividing plant development into the three stages emergence, flowering and maturation
    where the length of each stage is governed by the thermal time (Hansen 2002).
    The data used to calibrate Daisy was derived from the experimental site Lavalette
    in Montpellier, France where maize (variety Pioneer PR36K67) had been cultivated
    on a loamy soil in the year 2007. The model was verified by an experimental run
    in 2009 that confirmed crop parameters as reliable with measured vs. simulated
    yields of 16 t ha−1 to 17.5 t ha−1 for full irrigation (478 mm of total applied
    water of which 96 mm came from precipitation) and 11.8 t ha−1 to 12.1 t ha−1 for
    a deficit irrigation treatment (339 mm of total applied water of which 96 mm came
    from precipitation). Daily weather data records for 17 years (1991 to 2007) were
    used to generate 500 realizations of synthetic weather data for this Mediterranean
    climate. A subset that covered the growing period from May to October was selected
    and applied for optimization runs within OCCASION. Three cases were examined.
    In the first case, the SCWPF under no-rain condition was investigated; in the
    second case rainfall was included. For both cases, the IPCC baseline climate scenario
    was chosen. The third case comprised rainfall and the IPCC A2 climate scenario.
    Initial water stress was set to zero in all cases. Even though improbable, the
    first case was conceived to identify governing variables for crop yield in comparison
    to the second case by focusing solely on meteorological parameters. In the third
    case yield development under climate variability was investigated and compared
    to resulting yields of the second case. The overall model performance was subject
    to investigation in all three cases. 2.4 APSIM The Agricultural Production System
    Simulator (APSIM) (Keating et al. 2003) is a mechanistic crop growth model. It
    was developed by the Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit in Australia
    to simulate biophysical processes in farming systems by a modular approach to
    crop modeling. There are sets of modules for simulating biological and physical
    processes as well as management modules that specify management practices for
    the intended scenario and those control the simulation. Physical processes include
    soil water movement and solutes transport, soil nitrogen, soil phosphorous, soil
    pH and erosion. The soil water balance is implemented by two commonly used approaches;
    cascading layer and Richards equation. The matter transport is managed by the
    combined numerical solution of Richards equation and convection–dispersion equation.
    APSIM can be utilized for a wide range of grain and fiber crops mostly grown in
    temperate and tropical climates. Where biophysical modules are available, the
    model simulates growth, development, and yield. Crops currently included are barley,
    cotton, maize, peanut, sorghum, sunflower, wheat and others (Wang et al. 2002).
    The model operates on daily time steps (Keating et al. 2003). Maize (variety Katumani)
    and sorghum grown and irrigated at a hypothetical site in the coastal plain of
    Al-Batinah, Oman were investigated. Observed weather data for 16 years (1991 to
    2006) from Seeb weather station were used and baseline scenarios as well as IPCC
    scenarios B1 and A2 for the year 2080 applied. 500 realizations for each climate
    scenario were calculated whereas as subset of 100 realizations was selected for
    simulation/optimization runs in APSIM. An exemplary loamy soil from the APSIM
    soil database was selected which had similar properties to soils in the region;
    selected crop management practices such as sowing density resembled practices
    in the region. Sowing date was set to 15 January with no initial water deficit
    present. Fertilizer was only applied when nutrient stress was imminent. An overview
    of the crop models in this study is given in Table 1 with major model criteria
    and site information summarized. Table 1 Major characteristics of investigated
    crop models and study area Full size table 3 Results for the Individual Crop Models
    and Discussion 3.1 CropWat The resulting SCWPFs for maize and wheat are shown
    in Fig. 2. where the relative yield is plotted against the net irrigation amount
    with the quantiles of 10%, 50% and 90% (from top to bottom). For both crops, full
    irrigation is reached at around 600 mm of irrigation water. For no or low irrigation,
    the span in relative yield is notably high with around 0.6 and decreases with
    additional supply of irrigation water. For full irrigation, another extreme can
    be observed; the differences in quantiles are equal zero. The reason lies within
    the model structure of CropWat and its yield response proportional factor. The
    factor is unable to take variability in temperature and global radiation into
    account and cannot substitute photosynthesis processes. CropWat therefore does
    not seem predestined for calculation runs to improve water productivity by simulation-based
    optimization and climate change investigations in general. Fig. 2 SCWPFs and their
    empirical quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 from top to bottom respectively for maize
    and wheat at Kharagpur, India Full size image 3.2 PILOTE The statistical analysis
    of generated CWPFs resulted in the SCWPF for baseline, B1 and A2 climate scenarios
    which are shown in Fig. 3. with triangles representing a traditional irrigation
    scheme and squares representing a season independent optimized irrigation schedule.
    For the season independent schedule the average yield of the 400 weather scenarios
    was optimized. Thus, the optimized schedule is robust to weather and climate variations.
    Fig. 3 SCWPFs and their empirical quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 respectively for
    maize for IPCC scenarios A2, B1 and baseline with respective quantiles for the
    traditional irrigation scheme (triangles) and season independent optimized irrigation
    schedules for different total irrigation amounts (squares) Full size image As
    the SCWPFs show, there is a certain degree of variability within the quantiles
    in all climate scenarios once full irrigation is reached. There is also a decline
    in yields for the climate change scenarios A2 and B1. Looking at the baseline
    scenario, optimizing the irrigation shows that the maximum potential yield may
    already be achieved by applying a net irrigation amount of 350 mm. The traditional
    irrigation scheme on the contrary requires a net irrigation amount of 522 mm.
    This is equal to water saving of 33%. Additionally, by investigating the traditional
    irrigation scheme in the future IPCC climate scenarios the schedule resulted in
    even less total achieved yield and in higher yield variability. An alternative
    irrigation schedule with better yield reliability was found for a total of 400
    mm, 450 mm and 500 mm of net irrigation water. Up to this point, PILOTE produced
    satisfactory results. In a next step, the maize crop parameters applied for Bwanje
    were taken and used to set up the model for the site in Montpellier, France. The
    outline of these experiments was already presented in the Daisy section in part
    2. The model was parameterized and a plot of maize irrigated according to the
    model predictions of an irrigation schedule generated with PILOTE. Predicted outcome
    was 14 t ha−1 whereas actual yield harvested was 12 t ha−1. Furthermore, the development
    of the LAI did also not match the predictions. A closer investigation revealed
    unstable crop parameters and concluded in their non-transferability to other locations.
    Beyond that, crop parameters taken from the same location varied for different
    growing seasons as well. These circumstances make it difficult to apply PILOTE
    in performance studies for optimizing water productivity. Reliable results may
    be obtained, however, once stable crop parameters are found. 3.3 Daisy The results
    for the no-rain case are shown in Fig. 4. with generated CWPF on the left side
    and their corresponding SCWPF on the right. In there, applied water amounts ranging
    from 0 mm (no irrigation) to 500 mm (full irrigation) and crop yields between
    10 t ha−1 to 13 t ha−1 at full irrigation are plotted. The variability in crop
    yields (in absolute and relative terms) is greatest at full irrigation and decreases
    rapidly with less water applied. Since precipitation can be ruled out, it is believed
    that temperature and global radiation are the only major governing variables for
    crop growth and are therefore the reason for the variability in yields near full
    irrigation. This assumption is supported by the nearly normal distributed marginal
    distribution of the yield at full irrigation (not shown in the Figure). In contrast
    to this observation Daisy calculates crop yields for no or little irrigation but
    results are implausible for such low water applications. In theory it is possible
    to deprive the crop of water for almost the entire growing season and apply water
    only at the end and still get a fair amount of crop yield. This is caused by Daisy’s
    inability to simulate irreversible damage to the crop during drought stress. Though
    photosynthesis is reduced, once fully irrigated again, full transpiration rates
    are restored. Another reason is the initial soil moisture content which is used
    to calculate small but still unreliable amounts of yield. In any case, this range
    of water application is only of little scientific interest and may therefore be
    neglected. Fig. 4 Samples of generated CWPFs (left) and SCWPF (right) under no
    rain conditions for maize grown at Lavalette site, Montpellier, France (Schütze
    and Schmitz 2010) Full size image In a next step, the variability of rainfall
    was added to the simulation by taking precipitation into account (second case).
    Figure 5 shows the 500 generated CWPFs and the derived SCWPF. In comparison to
    case one (no-rain) yields range from 0.5 t ha−1 to 7 t ha−1 where no irrigation
    water was applied. Besides temperature and global radiation, the yield variability
    is now dominated by irrigation events; a left skewed marginal distribution at
    0 mm irrigation water (not shown) seems to confirm that explanation. With increasing
    amounts of irrigation water, however, global radiation and temperature become
    the main factors until a point where they almost entirely govern the variability
    in yields. Differences in the quantiles at full irrigation between this case and
    the no-rain case are however present indicating that a slight influence of precipitation
    remains. The marginal distribution at 500 mm follows a rather symmetrically distributed
    curve (not shown) which supports that conclusion. Fig. 5 Samples of generated
    CWPFs (left) and SCWPF (right) under rain conditions for maize grown at Lavalette
    site, Montpellier, France (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image In Fig. 6
    the results for case three (IPCC A2 climate scenario) are shown. The resulting
    SCWPF, which is comprised of 500 CWPFs, shows potential yields of 8 t ha−1 to
    11 t ha−1 at full irrigation. Compared to case two (IPCC baseline climate scenario),
    increased temperatures have caused a notable drop in crop yield of almost 2 t ha−1
    at full irrigation. Additionally, the higher skewness coefficient of the yield
    marginal distribution at 0 mm irrigation water is an indicator for an increased
    probability of dry conditions. The highest variance in potential yields can be
    observed between 60 mm and 210 mm due to the superposition of rainfall and radiation/temperature
    variability. The highest crop water productivity seems to be around 310 mm. Fig.

    IPCC A2 scenario (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image Daisy performed well.
    Projected crop yields, their respective water demands and the overall SCWPF curve
    progression seems plausible for the applied scenarios of no-rain and rain condition
    as well as the climate change scenario A2. By comparison of these scenarios, major
    meteorological variables influencing the variability of potential yields, i.e.
    global radiation, temperature and precipitation, could be identified. A set back
    in the Daisy model application is its inability to simulate permanent damage to
    the crop if heavy drought stress is sustained since the crop’s ability to photosynthesize
    at a full rate is restored afterwards. This together with the initial soil water
    reserve explains the implausible simulated crop yields in the CWPFs when total
    irrigation sums are very low (below 50 mm) which are however of little scientific
    interest and therefore negligible. 3.4 APSIM The results for maize and sorghum
    are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. In both figures the impact on potential
    yield for one growing cycle for baseline (top row), B1 (middle row) and A2 (bottom
    row) scenarios are presented. Furthermore, the figures are separated into SCWPF
    shown in the left column, and the yield histogram at an irrigation amount of 150
    mm in the middle column as well as near full irrigation in the right column (400
    mm for maize and 450 mm for sorghum). Comparing the three climate scenarios with
    each other, the yield for maize is reduced from 7.1 t ha−1 (baseline) over 6.1
    t ha−1 (B1) to 5.7 t ha−1 (A2). The temperature and radiation driven changes not
    only affect crop development in early stages and thus leading to faster plant
    development and shorter vegetative phases but also increase water requirements
    in a way that e.g. 400 mm are not sufficient anymore to reach near full yield
    potential. At the same time, standard deviations decrease with available amount
    of water (within the scenarios) as well as with temperature (between the scenarios)
    meaning the reliability to reach a certain crop yield increases. Fig. 7 SCWPFs

    irrigation amount at Al-Batinah site, Oman (Schütze et al. 2011a) Full size image
    Looking at the baseline and A2 climate scenarios the drop in sorghum yields is
    not as high as for maize. This indicates a lighter impact of water stress and
    climate variability on the development of sorghum with yields decreasing from
    10.3 t ha−1 (for baseline) to 9.6 t ha−1 (for A2). There is also a change in the
    histogram distribution between 150 mm and 450 mm within each climate scenario
    from skewed to normal indicating a dominating impact of temperature and radiation.
    The changes in the B1 climate scenario are not as strong. These results seem to
    indicate that the cultivation of sorghum as a crop with high water stress resistance
    could be a viable option when considering future cropping patterns. The results
    suggest that APSIM can cope with climate variability and calculates plausible
    potential crop yields for the different climate scenarios. Values for maize and
    sorghum suggest good model performance when investigating systems to improve water
    productivity. The true potential of APSIM, however, may only be fully discovered
    once field experiments have been carried out and findings used for calibration.
    Until then APSIM remains a promising candidate for the framework presented. 4
    Summary and Conclusion This study, and its application of OCCASION, is limited
    to the investigation of water productivity under the influence of climate variability
    where only global radiation, temperature and precipitation were considered. There
    are, however, more variables affecting water productivity such as soil salinity,
    agricultural management practices and soil variability. In theory, all these variables
    could be implemented into OCCASION with no increase in complexity of the optimization
    problem since the random variables are independent. Hence, it must be mentioned
    that presented results are only valid within the boundaries specified. CropWat
    showed unsatisfying performance for the investigated scenarios. Quantiles of yield
    of the SCWPF did not differ once full irrigation was reached. Reason is the yield
    response proportional factor that accounts for the relative loss in yield. The
    factor is no adequate substitute to describe plant physiology and reaction to
    climate variability and climate change. The successor of CropWat is AquaCrop where
    fundamental changes were made by replacing the yield response proportional factor.
    Main changes include the separation of evapotranspiration into crop transpiration
    and soil evaporation. Beyond, crop yield now depends on crop biomass and harvest
    index. Another improvement is the change in time steps to days which now enables
    the plant response to drought stress adequately (Steduto et al. 2009). This makes
    AquaCrop a possibly more suitable candidate for water productivity improvements
    within a stochastic framework. This conclusion is supported through results presented
    by Geerts et al. (2009) and Heng et al. (2009). Unfortunately, batch processing
    remains an unsolved problem in AquaCrop. PILOTE did perform well and plausible
    results were obtained for the investigated site for the baseline, A2 and B1 climate
    scenarios. Unlike CropWat, there was certain variability in quantiles once full
    irrigation was reached. Transferring the model to another location, however, showed
    less satisfactory results. A more detailed investigation revealed that applied
    crop parameters were not transferable to other locations. Therefore, once a conservative
    set of cop parameters is found PILOTE might be well suited for optimizing water
    productivity. Daisy has convinced in most of the cases. The model is capable of
    plausibly simulating potential yields and the respective supply of irrigation
    water for no-rain and rain conditions. Daisy can also take scenarios with different
    climate settings, historic as well as future, into account and produces results
    that are well in the range of expectation. All this, however, applies only for
    light drought stress where no permanent damage occurs to the crop. Cases that
    yet result in irreversible damage to the plant are neither of scientific nor practical
    or economic relevance and are limited to values in the range of the lower third
    of the generated SCWPF. This set back is outweighed by the fact that model and
    crop parameters were successfully applied in another study for a location in Germany
    where an irrigation experiment was carried out with different treatments for water
    stress (Walser et al. 2011). Irrigation schemes and projected yields were simulated
    by OCCASION prior to the experimental run. Results indicate that model and crop
    parameters in particular are robust and transferable. Values taken from the upper
    third of the generated SCWPF can therefore be used reliably. Limitations in the
    range of the middle section of the SCWPF have not yet been determined. It can
    be concluded that Daisy seems to be a suitable candidate to be used in a simulation
    based approach to improve water productivity within a stochastic framework. APSIM,
    the only SVAT model that was not calibrated by field experiments in advance but
    where observed weather and soil input data were used, showed plausible results
    for potential yields and water demands for baseline, A2 and B1 climate scenarios
    for maize and sorghum. The results also imply that substituting plants by crops
    better suited to drier conditions, such as sorghum compared to maize, could be
    part of an approach to cope with climate change when considering future cropping
    patterns (besides other factors affecting this choice). Even though carried out
    as a hypothetical study, APSIM remains to be a promising candidate for optimization
    within the applied framework. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to conduct a
    limited number of experiments in order to obtain cultivar-specific crop parameters
    for model calibration. The results presented show that not all crop growth models
    are eligible for simulation-based optimization that targets at the improvement
    of water productivity within a stochastic framework. Certain criteria have to
    be met for obtaining plausible values of potential yields and their respective
    water demands. These criteria are most importantly (i) the good representation
    of plant physiology within the crop growth model with modules for assimilation,
    respiration, partitioning of carbon, senescence and others along with (ii) the
    realistic and plausible response of crop to water stress. Beyond that, minor considerations
    are (iii) the model’s ability to account for spatial distribution of water in
    soil when dealing with modern irrigation systems such as micro irrigation and
    (iv) favoring a time resolution of days instead of weeks for better consideration
    of plant response to water stress. Finally, all models are in need of (v) robust
    crop parameters that allow for their transferability and application in a wide
    range of locations. Beyond that, it became apparent during the investigation that
    crop growth models also have to fulfill certain basic requirements for being efficiently
    utilized as part of this stochastic framework at all. The model has to (i) be
    able to consider climate variability to take full benefit from the weather generator’s
    built-in IPCC climate change scenarios. (ii) Model parameters have to be transferable
    in space and time for a robust model application. And there is the practical aspect
    that (iii) the model should have the ability for batch processing since several
    hundred simulations have to be evaluated in order to obtain the SCWPF. All crop
    growth models complied with the last point except for CropWat. Computational effort
    and therefore runtime for a simulation might be an issue but can be mitigated
    by high-performance computing (HPC). References Abrahamsen P, Hansen S (2000)

    Poplars are fast-growing, high-yielding forest tree species, whose cultivation
    as

    second-generation biofuel crops is of increasing interest and can efﬁciently meet

    emission reduction goals. Yet, breeding elite poplar trees for drought resistance

    remains a major challenge. Worldwide breeding programs are largely focused on

    intra/interspeciﬁc hybridization, whereby Populus nigra L. is a fundamental parental
    pool.

    While high-throughput genotyping has resulted in unprecedented capabilities to
    rapidly

    decode complex genetic architecture of plant stress resistance, linking genomics
    to

    phenomics is hindered by technically challenging phenotyping. Relying on unmanned

    aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing and imaging techniques, high-throughput

    ﬁeld phenotyping (HTFP) aims at enabling highly precise and efﬁcient, non-destructive

    screening of genotype performance in large populations. To efﬁciently support
    forest-

    tree breeding programs, ground-truthing observations should be complemented with

    standardized HTFP. In this study, we develop a high-resolution (leaf level) HTFP
    approach

    to investigate the response to drought of a full-sib F2 partially inbred population

    (termed here ‘POP6’), whose F1 was obtained from an intraspeciﬁc P. nigra controlled

    cross between genotypes with highly divergent phenotypes. We assessed the effects

    of two water treatments (well-watered and moderate drought) on a population of

    4603 trees (503 genotypes) hosted in two adjacent experimental plots (1.67 ha)

    by conducting low-elevation (25 m) ﬂights with an aerial drone and capturing 7836

    thermal infrared (TIR) images. TIR images were undistorted, georeferenced, and

    orthorectiﬁed to obtain radiometric mosaics. Canopy temperature (Tc) was extracted

    using two independent semi-automated segmentation techniques, eCognition- and

    Matlab-based, to avoid the mixed-pixel problem. Overall, results showed that the

    UAV platform-based thermal imaging enables to effectively assess genotype variability

    under drought stress conditions. Tc derived from aerial thermal imagery presented
    a

    good correlation with ground-truth stomatal conductance (gs) in both segmentation

    techniques. Interestingly, the HTFP approach was instrumental to detect drought-

    HTFP of Poplar Response to Drought

    INTRODUCTION

    Fast growing Populus clones are among the most common

    lignocellulosic

    feedstocks

    for

    second-generation

    bioenergy

    production in Europe (Amichev et al., 2010; Sannigrahi et al.,

    2010; Sabatti et al., 2014; Djomo et al., 2015). A recent report of

    the International Poplar Commission indicates that the total area

    of short rotation coppice (SRC) Populus across Europe is about

    23,502 ha (FAO, 2016). However, the current surface area planted

    with SRC Populus in Europe was estimated at about 45,000 ha by

    Alasia Franco Vivai (Franco Alasia, Personal Communication),

    taking into account the establishment of few thousands ha in

    recent years in Poland. Compared to alternative bioenergy crops,

    SRC plantations oﬀer versatile year-round coppice cycles and

    high yield to input ratio (Sims and Venturi, 2004). To alleviate

    the conﬂict between food and biofuel production (Rockwood

    et al., 2004; Edrisi and Abhilash, 2016), SRC plantations are

    typically grown on marginal lands, which are inadequate for

    high productivity crop growth (Herr and Carlson, 2013), thus

    generating an income without the need for a land remediation

    period (Paulson et al., 2003).

    Short rotation coppice Populus clones are selected from world-

    wide breeding programs based on interspeciﬁc hybridization,

    whereby black poplar (Populus nigra L.) is a fundamental parental

    pool (Stanton et al., 2013); being widely and naturally spread

    in Europe, typically associated with riparian ecosystems, and

    characterized by large phenotypic and genetic variability (van

    der Schoot et al., 2000; Richardson et al., 2014; DeWoody et al.,

    2015). Moreover, P. nigra has been thoroughly studied due

    to its numerous adaptive characteristics, including easy clonal

    propagation, good coppicing ability, resistance to pathogens and

    parasites (Benetka et al., 2012), prolonged growing season (Rohde

    et al., 2011), and high plasticity in response to environmental

    conditions (Chamaillard et al., 2011). Breeding strategies based

    on recurrent selection and testing are frequently implemented

    for gradual population improvement (Neale and Kremer, 2011).

    Acceleration of the Populus domestication is also expected

    through recurrent intraspeciﬁc crossing and higher order species

    mixes, yet to be supplemented by genomic selection, association

    genetics, and genetic engineering (Harfouche et al., 2012). While

    ﬁrst-generation hybridization (F1) is adopted to obtain heterosis

    for growth rate (Stettler et al., 1988), advanced generation

    breeding, such as F2 hybridization, among closely related Populus

    species, has proved to be an eﬃcient strategy toward genetic

    improvement (Stanton et al., 2010).

    Field-grown trees are routinely exposed to environmental

    stress and are likely to experience unprecedented rises in

    temperature and increases in the frequency and severity of

    summer drought episodes in the future (Lindner et al., 2014;

    IPCC, 2014). The physiological responses to drought are complex

    and traits vary in their importance depending on intensity,

    duration, and timing of the drought (Bréda and Badeau, 2008;

    Tardieu and Tuberosa, 2010; Harfouche et al., 2014). These traits

    present as reduced leaf size, decreased leaf growth rate, lowered

    stomatal aperture and density, reduced stomatal conductance

    (gs), and altered patterns of root development (Tardieu and

    Tuberosa, 2010). Furthermore, inside the leaf, prolonged drought

    periods reduce CO2 assimilation rates and the extra energy

    dissipation, with a consequent increase in reactive oxygen species

    production, leading to leaf senescence and yield loss (Pintó-

    Marijuan and Munné-Bosch, 2014). Physiological and molecular

    studies on drought tolerance in Populus have shed light on the

    considerable divergence in response to water deﬁcit between

    diﬀerent genotypes (Marron et al., 2002; Monclus et al., 2006;

    Street et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2009; Regier et al., 2009; Cocozza

    et al., 2010; Viger et al., 2016).

    Plant tolerance to abiotic stresses is an ambiguous concept,

    even after distinguishing diﬀerent strategies such as avoidance,

    tolerance, and escape (Levitt, 1972). Depending on their

    genetically dictated molecular and physiological attributes, plants

    budget their water in very diﬀerent ways, along a continuum

    that ranges from the water-conserving or risk-aversion behavior

    displayed by isohydric plants to the risk-taking behavior

    displayed by anisohydric plants (Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998;

    Moshelion et al., 2014; Sade and Moshelion, 2014; Attia et al.,

    2015).

    In reduced water availability conditions, the relationship

    between gs and leaf temperature has been utilized as a valid

    indicator of trees’ response (Chaves et al., 2003; Bréda et al., 2006;

    Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011; Costa et al., 2013; Rebetzke et al., 2013;

    Struthers et al., 2015). Therefore, relating the leaf temperature of

    individuals to the average value of a population exposed to similar

    environmental conditions may be indicative of the trees’ state of

    stress.

    A major obstacle to a more eﬀective dissection of plant

    response to drought is the diﬃculty in properly phenotyping in

    a high-throughput fashion. To relieve a phenotyping bottleneck,

    phenotypic traits should be turned into quantiﬁable, objective,

    and consistent measures. Furthermore, automated and high-

    throughput phenotyping (HTP) on large-scale plant populations

    is expected to increase the probability of detecting crucial traits

    and, thus, identifying eﬀective genotype-phenotype relationships

    (Goggin et al., 2015). HTP envisions a suite of strategies to

    speed up the phenotyping process and maximize the number

    of studied plants per experiment (Goggin et al., 2015). These

    methods enable automated, non-destructive, and non-invasive

    screening of high dimensionality populations, and thus, allowing

    the same plants and their responses to changing environmental

    factors to be monitored throughout their life cycle (Fahlgren

    et al., 2015a). To facilitate data interpretation, HTP platforms

    often involve observations in controlled conditions, such as

    growth chambers and greenhouses. However, plant performance

    in highly controlled conditions is poorly correlated with breeders’

    target commercial and real-world environments (White et al.,

    2012; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Deery et al., 2014; Ghanem et al.,

    2015; Izawa, 2015; Poland, 2015). With regards to the speciﬁc

    case of drought, phenotyping under controlled conditions is

    highly challenging. In fact, the declining soil moisture content

    and increasing mechanical impedance typical of droughts are

    diﬃcult to replicate in pots that are much smaller than the

    volume of soil available in the ﬁeld (Cairns et al., 2011; Passioura,

    2012). This fact may result in fast plant response through

    stomatal closure, which may, in turn, mask slower adaptive

    processes.

    HTFP of Poplar Response to Drought

    High-throughput phenotyping approaches seek to gather

    remote information; however, close-range (proximal) sensing

    is frequently required to provide the adequate resolution to

    decipher phenotypic traits (White et al., 2012). Proximal HTP

    combines robotic technology and imaging to enable high-

    dimensional phenotype screening and capture. Unmanned aerial

    vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras and sensors are proximal

    remote sensing that bridge the gap between time consuming

    ground-based measurements and satellite/airborne observations

    (Gago

    et

    al.,

    2015).

    Compared

    to

    traditional

    ground-

    based techniques, UAVs enable rapid and non-destructive

    measurements. They also oﬀer much quicker turnaround

    times than satellites at competitive costs (Berni et al., 2009).

    In terms of spatial resolution, diﬀerent from satellites, UAVs

    allow the acquisition of images whose pixels are signiﬁcantly

    smaller than objects of interest, thus minimizing the bias eﬀect

    due to background intensity (mixed-pixel problem) (Jones

    and Sirault, 2014). In contrast to aircrafts, such as manned

    helicopters, UAVs can safely hover at low altitudes in the

    proximity of plants, thus allowing high resolutions at low costs

    (White et al., 2012). In light of such advantages, UAVs are

    expected to open new avenues in ﬁeld-based phenotyping of

    multiple stress traits and large populations rapidly, precisely, and

    accurately.

    With

    regards

    to

    the

    evaluation

    of

    drought

    response,

    conventional

    ground-based

    methods

    typically

    require

    gs

    measurements, which involve time consuming contact with

    leaves (Maes and Steppe, 2012; Costa et al., 2013). Alternatively,

    based on the relationship between gs and leaf temperature, UAVs

    have been furnished with thermometers and thermal infrared

    (TIR) cameras to capture images of large-scale populations

    (Berni et al., 2009). TIR cameras show great potential in

    phenotyping as thermal images contain spatially distributed

    information about the energy emitted from body surfaces, such

    as plant leaves. Thermal images can be used to detect the state

    of stress due to drought and indirectly estimate gs through the

    leaf energy balance equation (Jones, 1992, 1999). Since canopy

    temperature (Tc) has long been recognized as a measure of plant

    water status (Jones et al., 2009), UAVs mounting sensors have

    been used for mapping drought response of agricultural crops at

    20–40 cm spatial resolution (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006, 2007;

    Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012).

    Although imaging has revolutionized plant phenotyping

    through the early and quantitative detection of plant traits in

    objective terms (Dhondt et al., 2013; Goggin et al., 2015), massive

    image data handling and processing remains the rate-limiting

    step in HTP (Fahlgren et al., 2015b). Image post-processing

    may include several steps, such as calibration and undistortion

    (Berni et al., 2009; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013; Araus and Cairns,

    2014), which should be automated in data management pipelines

    to boost HTP. Within data post-processing, the identiﬁcation

    of objects of interest in images against other objects and the

    background (segmentation) (Jähne, 2005) is often the most

    critical step (Dhondt et al., 2013). In phenotyping studies,

    segmentation algorithms have been developed for plant three-

    dimensional measurements (Chéné et al., 2012) and to estimate

    crown architecture parameters (Díaz-Varela et al., 2015). For

    imaging to substantially contribute to HTP, standardized semi-

    automated image processing tools should be introduced and

    complemented with ground-truthing through well-established

    point measurement sensors (Fahlgren et al., 2015b).

    Here, we developed a novel methodology for ﬁeld HTP

    (HTFP) of drought stress in a P. nigra F2 partially inbred

    population using TIR images recorded from a UAV platform.

    The objectives of this study were to establish a ﬁeld-scale HTP

    procedure to rapidly and precisely examine drought stress in

    trees; to provide objective image-based tools and statistical

    protocols to quantify phenotypic traits of moderately stressed

    and non-stressed trees; and to use HTFP to identify promising

    drought-tolerant genotypes for potential use within Populus

    breeding programs.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    The workﬂow of the developed methodology is illustrated in

    Figure 1. The HTFP method involves the following four steps: (1)

    UAV-based thermography to capture tree Tc; (2) semi-automatic

    georeferencing, orthorectiﬁcation, and mosaicking of TIR

    images; (3) tree canopy identiﬁcation against bare soil through

    two independent image segmentation approaches; and (4)

    ground-truthing validation of UAV-based thermal data with gs

    data.

    Field Experiments

    Plant Material and Experimental Design

    POP6 is a full-sib F2 partially inbred population consisting of

    691 genotypes obtained from an intraspeciﬁc controlled cross

    between two P. nigra parents, P64 and P36. Parents have been

    randomly selected from an F1 breeding population (POP5) of

    457 genotypes, obtained from an intraspeciﬁc P. nigra controlled

    cross between genotypes 58-861 and Poli (Figure 1A). Such

    genotypes originated from natural populations in divergent

    environmental conditions: 58-861 is from cold/wet climates

    typical of Val Cenischia (Northern Italy; 45◦09′N, 07◦01′E, 597 m

    above sea level), whereas Poli originates from warm/dry climates

    typical of Policoro (Southern Italy; 40◦09′N, 16◦41′E, 7 m above

    sea level). These genotypes are characterized by contrasting

    responses to water stress (Regier et al., 2009; Cocozza et al., 2010).

    In January 2012, F2 genotypes were used to establish a stool

    bed and produce 1-year old material. Such material was harvested

    in January 2013 to produce hardwood cuttings. A large number of

    hardwood cuttings (20 cm long) was obtained per each genotype,

    and cuttings whose diameter was within 3–4 cm and with a large

    number of intact buds were labeled and stored at +4◦C.

    The experimental ﬁeld-scale plots were located in Savigliano

    (Northern Italy; 44◦35′36.97′′N, 07◦37′15.27′′E, 349 m above

    sea level), and were established in April 2013. Two adjacent

    plots (1.67 ha of total extension) were developed to expose

    POP6 genotypes to two diﬀerent water treatments (see Section

    “Water Treatment”) (Figure 1B). Each plot featured a completely

    randomized block design with four blocks. A single hardwood

    cutting per genotype was randomly assigned to each block to

    minimize variability attributable to eventually uncontrollable

    Savigliano (Italy) to host POP6 genotypes exposed to well-watered (WW) and moderate
    drought (mDr) stress conditions. In a plot, WW conditions were maintained,

    whereby water lost during the day through tree evapotranspiration (ETc, mm) was
    daily restored via drip irrigation. In the other plot, mDr conditions were maintained

    by withholding irrigation. In each plot, soil water content was daily monitored
    through a time domain reﬂectometry SM150 Soil Moisture Sensor installed at 50

    underneath the soil surface. (C) Leaf stomatal conductance gs was collected using
    a dynamic diffusion porometer. Measurements were taken on three biological

    camera. The UAV campaign allowed for capturing TIR images of both experimental
    plots. (E) The ﬂight mission was planned using the open source autopilot Mission

    Planner. The UAV was ﬂown in the autonomous mode at a nominal speed of 3 m/s.
    (F) Fish-eye undistortion, image orthorectiﬁcation, georeferencing, and

    two alternative automatic image segmentation approaches (an in-house algorithm
    in Matlab and eCognition).

    environmental factors (such as soil composition and fertility).

    Diﬀerently, for P64, P36, 58-861, and Poli, four cuttings were

    replicated per each block to ensure larger data availability.

    Cuttings were planted at a distance of 2.5 m × 1 m, between

    and within rows, respectively. In addition, the border eﬀect, i.e.,

    trees planted at external locations of plots display better growth

    conditions, was minimized by planting a double border row of

    P. nigra cv. Jean Pourtet around the sides of each plot. Therefore,

    a total of 6716 trees were planted in the experimental plots.

    In March 2013, multiple sprouts were thinned to a single stem

    per stamp, choosing the most vigorous. During the ﬁrst growing

    season in 2013, drought treatment was not applied to ensure

    a homogeneous root system development and, thus, minimize

    eﬀects on shoot growth due to diﬀerent cutting dimensions. In

    the same growing season, both plots were regularly irrigated

    with a drip irrigation system during dry periods, and weeds

    were controlled using mechanized and chemical practices. In

    February 2014, experimental plots were coppiced, and for the

    second growing season in 2014, plots were managed similarly

    to 2013. In February 2015, trees were again coppiced and, in

    March 2015, re-sprouts were thinned to a single stem. Finally,

    due to a mortality of 12.7% of the original trees planted in 2013,

    4603 plants (503 genotypes) were available at the beginning of the

    drought experiment in July 2015.

    Weather and Soil Condition Analysis

    Weather data at the experimental setup were obtained from

    a meteorological station managed by Agency for Protection

    of Environment – Piemonte (ARPA-Piemonte1) and located at

    10 km from the experimental plots. Observations gathered from

    1994 to 2013 indicate an annual mean temperature of 11.8◦C

    and a total annual rainfall of 740 mm at the site. According to

    Köppen-Geiger classiﬁcation (Kottek et al., 2006), climate was

    classiﬁed as Cfb, that is, warm temperate, fully humid and with

    warm summers. During the experiment in 2015, a 2 km distant

    meteorological station (Delta-T Devices Ltd., United Kingdom)

    was also used to record hourly air temperature (Tair), air

    humidity, and precipitation.

    Soil samples were collected from the middle of plots to

    quantify soil texture and to estimate ﬁeld capacity and permanent

    wilting point. These samples were taken from topsoil down

    to a maximum depth of 0.5 m. The soil type was a sandy

    loam (50.5% sand, 35.5% loam, and 14.0% clay), using the

    United States Department of Agriculture soil taxonomy. Soil ﬁeld

    1http://www.arpa.piemonte.it

    capacity and permanent wilting point were estimated to 34 and

    9.5%, respectively. Soil texture was estimated using gravimetric

    analysis, whereas soil ﬁeld capacity and permanent wilting point

    were evaluated using the pressure-based method (Richards and

    Weaver, 1944).

    Water Treatment

    Response to drought stress was investigated by exposing POP6 to

    diﬀerent water regimes for a period of 26 days, from 2nd July 2015

    (day of the year; DOY 183) to 28th July 2015 (DOY 209). In one

    plot, well-watered (WW) conditions were maintained, whereby

    water lost during the day through tree evapotranspiration

    (ETc, mm) was daily restored via drip irrigation, see Figure 1B.

    Water provisioned through drip irrigation was estimated based

    on site-speciﬁc reference evapotranspiration (ET0, mm) and

    on Populus crop coeﬃcient (kc). ET0 was found according to

    FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998), and

    kc was set to 0.84 in July and to 1.21 in August (Guidi et al.,

    2008). In the other plot, moderate drought (mDr) conditions

    were established by exposing plants only to natural rainfall.

    Drought was imposed by withholding irrigation from DOY 183,

    and monitoring the progressive reduction of soil moisture until

    a pre-wilting (i.e., sub-lethal) level of soil water content was

    achieved.

    In each plot, soil water content was daily monitored through a

    time domain reﬂectometry SM150 Soil Moisture Sensor (Delta-T

    Devices Ltd., United Kingdom) installed at 50 cm underneath

    the soil surface. Four measures per day were recorded using

    a DL6 Data Logger (Delta-T Devices Ltd., United Kingdom),

    and the daily average soil water content was estimated. Such

    system allowed controllability over the experiment, by ensuring

    that WW and mDr conditions were maintained in the plots.

    During the drought experiment, daily average Tair (◦C), daily

    rainfall (mm), daily water deﬁcit (mm), and soil water content

    expressed as percentage of water ﬁeld capacity (%FC) in WW and

    mDr plots were reported (Supplementary Figures S1A–C). Soil

    permanent wilting point is reported as a percentage of the water

    ﬁeld capacity (%FC = 27.9%). Daily water deﬁcit was calculated

    as the diﬀerence between precipitation and ETc, according to

    Cantero-Martínez et al. (2007).

    powerful (24V-6S motors) hexacopter (120 cm diagonal size)

    with a highly resistant carbon ﬁber frame and oﬀering a 7 kg

    take-oﬀ weight. Its maximum transmission distance is 2 km

    and its maximum ﬂight time is 20 min. The FLIR A35 was

    equipped with a 9 mm f1.25 lens. Its thermal sensitivity is less

    than 0.05◦C at 30◦C and the camera enables measurements in

    the range −25◦C to +135◦C. The image sensor is a Focal Plane

    Array (FPA) based on uncooled microbolometers with a spectral

    response in the range 7.5–13 µm. The camera ﬁeld of view is

    equal to 48◦ (horizontally) × 39◦ (vertically), its resolution to

    320 pixels × 256 pixels, and its spatial resolution to 2.78 mrad.

    The camera captures images at an acquisition frequency of 60 Hz.

    Pictures are stored as 14 bit digital raw images. The camera

    is radiometrically calibrated, and its high accuracy and pixel-

    to-pixel sensitivity circumvent the need for ground infrared

    calibration targets and temperature correction during post-

    processing (Deery et al., 2016; Gómez-Candón et al., 2016). The

    camera is controlled by an embedded computer (Pico PC with a

    Cortex 9 processor) that stores raw images on an internal micro

    SDD memory card for the entire duration of the ﬂight.

    A total of 16 highly visible targets were positioned along

    the borders of the experimental plots (8 targets per plot were

    located at the corners and in the middle of each side) and

    used as ground control points (GCPs). The targets were used

    for georeferencing thermal images. A Real-Time Kinematic

    global positioning system (GPS; Leica Geosystems, Switzerland)

    GS08plus model with an accuracy of 3 mm was used for capturing

    GCP locations.

    Flight Plan and Thermal Imaging

    The ﬂight mission was planned using the open source autopilot

    Mission Planner (APM Mission Planner, United States). The

    UAV was ﬂown in the autonomous mode (GPS-waypoint

    navigation) at a nominal speed of 3 m/s. Experimental plots

    were scanned during two 11-min ﬂights conducted on 28th July

    2015 under stable cloudless and low-wind conditions. To ensure

    similar solar illumination angles and consistent proportions

    of sunlit and shaded leaves (Deery et al., 2014), ﬂights were

    performed at 13:41 local time above WW and at 14:30 local time

    above mDr.

    To capture the experimental plots in a single ﬂight pass while

    maximizing image resolution, ﬂight plan consisted of transects

    parallel to the plant rows, see Figure 1E. A ground station

    processed the UAV safety manual control and sent telemetry

    data (position, attitude, and status data) through a radio link at

    2.4 GHz to a laptop computer. This communication link also

    allowed operation of the onboard TIR camera.

    Thermal images were recorded at an elevation of 25 m

    from ground level, thus yielding an 8.9 (vertical) m × 11.1

    (horizontal) m and a pixel size of 6 cm × 6 cm. Such a

    resolution is within POP6 average leaf area (46.47 cm2 or

    1.3 pixels, unpublished data). Flying at such an elevation

    minimizes

    image

    distortions

    due

    to

    atmospheric

    eﬀects.

    The selected ﬂight plan enabled capture of thousands of

    high quality single images presenting 30% overlap and 50%

    sidelap. Since images captured during take-oﬀ, landing, and

    ﬂight maneuvers were discarded from further processing,

    acquisition of images took a few minutes per experimental

    plot.

    Stomatal Conductance Ground-truthing

    To validate the UAV-based approach, we studied the relationship

    between ground-based midday stomatal conductance (gs, mmol

    m−2 s−1) and Tc collected from the UAV for selected genotypes,

    see Figure 1C. At the same time of UAV ﬂights, we collected

    abaxial gs data using a dynamic diﬀusion porometer (AP4,

    Delta-T devices Ltd., United Kingdom). Measurements were

    taken on three biological replicates per two water treatments on

    each of the four parental genotypes (3 × 2 × 4 = 24 trees). On

    each tree, two gs technical replicates were taken on the ﬁrst sunlit

    fully expanded leaf from the canopy top. For each plot, before

    measurements, the porometer was calibrated according to the

    experimental site Tair and humidity. Instrument calibration, gs

    measurements, and moving within and between plots required

    approximately 3 h.

    Thermal Image Processing

    We collected a total of 7836 thermal images (“.ﬀf” ﬁles) during

    the UAV campaign. Given the high overlap and sidelap, one

    frame every 20 (392 images) was converted to radiometric “.jpg”

    through IRT Analyzer (Grayess, United States), and ﬁsh-eye

    undistorted through Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe Systems,

    United States) (lens adjustment tool) by setting the camera

    focal length to 9 mm, see Figure 1F. Image mosaicking was

    performed with the Image Composite Editor software (Microsoft

    Corporation, United States), and radiometric mosaics were

    then converted to grid data with Surfer (Golden Software,

    United States). Mosaics were orthorectiﬁed and georeferenced

    with ArcGIS 9.2 (ESRI, United States). Orthomosaics were

    georeferenced by manually matching the surveyed 16 GCPs

    (Figure 1F).

    Mosaics were processed to remove bare soil pixels (Jones

    and Sirault, 2014), and used to estimate average Tc (◦C) for

    each tree. In particular, radiometric mosaics were combined

    with the position of the tree centers and spacing in the

    experimental plots (Figure 2). Firstly, radiometric mosaics were

    segmented to automatically identify regions depicting trees.

    Canopy identiﬁcation was achieved through two independent

    semi-automatic image segmentation approaches (Figure 1G).

    We utilized the eCognition commercial software (eCognition

    Developer 9, Tremble Inc., United States) that is commonly

    adopted in image-based analysis for environmental applications.

    Further, we in-house developed a second segmentation algorithm

    in a Matlab environment (Matlab R2014a, The Mathworks Inc.,

    United States).

    In the eCognition segmentation, parameters such as canopy

    shape (set to 0.1), compactness (set to 0.5), and scale (set to 10)

    were used to identify trees. To address bare soil pixel removal,

    two pixel classes were introduced. One class included pixels at

    temperatures ranging from 15 to 27◦C and from 14 to 28◦C

    for WW and mDr, respectively (named “Poplar” in Figure 1G).

    Conversely, the second class consisted of pixels at temperatures

    lower and higher than the above ranges (named “Weed” and

    “Soil” in Figure 1G). We visually ascertained in the radiometric

    pertaining to “Soil” and “Weed” are assigned null temperature values (white areas)
    in the intersected buffer, whereas pixels relative to “Poplars” range from 15
    to

    27◦C and display different colors for segmented areas at homogeneous temperatures.
    Tc for each plant is estimated by averaging values of pixels lying inside each

    intersected buffer.

    mosaics that the ﬁrst class of temperatures was related to plants,

    and the second to soil and weed. Segmented areas “Weed” and

    “Soil” were discarded in the subsequent temperature extraction

    analysis.

    In the alternative segmentation approach, Otsu’s threshold

    selection method was implemented on the entire radiometric

    mosaics (Otsu, 1979). Mosaic histograms were thresholded to

    obtain nine level-segmented images. The eﬀectiveness of the

    segmentation was assessed through Otsu’s objective criterion

    (N = 0.99 in case of eight thresholds). Based on visual inspection

    of the mosaics, pixels at temperatures ranging from 15 to 27◦C

    (WW) and from 14 to 28◦C (mDr) were retained for estimating

    average Tc.

    After segmentation, pixels relative to soil and weed were

    assigned null temperature values in the radiometric mosaics.

    Then, 40 cm-radius circular buﬀers centered on the trees

    were intersected with the segmented mosaics (Figure 2).

    Since neighboring plants were spaced by 1 m within a row,

    such conservative buﬀer was selected to guarantee the precise

    identiﬁcation of each plant canopy. Finally, Tc for each tree was

    calculated by averaging pixel values lying inside each intersected

    buﬀer.

    Statistical Analysis

    Phenotypic variance of a total of 503 genotypes was investigated

    using R software (R v.3.1.3, R Foundation for Statistical

    Computing, Austria). Due to natural replicates mortality since

    plot establishment, only genotypes with at least three replicates

    in both WW and mDr were retained in the analysis. Two-way

    ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) inferential statistic procedure

    was used to describe the eﬀects of genotype, treatment, and

    their interaction on total phenotypic variance observed in POP6.

    To respect ANOVA assumptions, the Box-Cox procedure (Box

    and Cox, 1964) was performed on the additive model to yield

    optimal data transformation, and Bartlett’s test was used to

    test the homogeneity of variance. When statistically signiﬁcant

    diﬀerences among blocks were found, block eﬀect adjustment

    was conducted to minimize the inﬂuence of competition among

    neighboring trees on genotype-speciﬁc response to drought

    conditions. Adjustment was performed according to Dillen et al.

    (2009), and it was repeated separately for each experimental plot.

    The generalized linear mixed model was built to test

    diﬀerences among genotypes within each treatment and between

    the two treatments, and diﬀerences due to the genotype by

    treatment interaction (G × T). G × T aims at testing the

    consistency in the relative performance of genotypes grown in

    diﬀerent conditions (White et al., 2007). Statistical signiﬁcance

    was considered for p-values ≤ 0.05. To capture the proportion

    of total phenotypic variance due to genetic variation, broad-

    sense heritability (H2) was estimated for Tc in each treatment

    according to Sehgal et al. (2015):

    H2 = σ2

    G/[σ2

    G + (σ2

    ε/r)]

    (1)

    Here, σ2

    G and σ2

    ε are the genetic and residual variance

    components, respectively, and r is the average number of

    replicates for a genotype within treatment (i.e., 3.5).

    Moreover, to provide a better estimation, H2 was calculated

    over combined treatments, taking into account the G × T eﬀects

    on total variance:

    H2 = σ2

    G/[σ2

    G + (σ2

    G × T/n) + (σ2

    ε/nr)]

    (2)

    Here, σ2

    G × T is the G × T variance component, n is the number

    of treatments, and r is the average number of replicates for a

    genotype in the experiment (i.e., 7.3).

    Variance components were obtained using the restricted

    maximum likelihood (REML) procedure, with treatment as ﬁxed

    eﬀect, and genotype and G × T as random eﬀects.

    Finally, to evaluate the robustness of the independent

    segmentation procedures, diﬀerences between Tc

    datasets

    obtained with eCognition and Matlab, and the precision of

    both procedures was tested using the Student’s t-test and the

    Spearman’s rank correlation test. Statistical signiﬁcance of the

    correlation coeﬃcient (ρ) was considered for p-values ≤ 0.05.

    Stress Susceptibility Index

    Populus nigra genotype response to drought was dissected by

    computing the Stress Susceptibility Index (SSI) on UAV-based Tc.

    Such an index has proved to be an eﬃcient tool to classify plants

    according to their tolerance or sensitivity to water stress (Sánchez

    et al., 2015). SSI was calculated based on genotypic mean Tc

    according to Fischer and Maurer (1978):

    SSI = [1 − (TcmDr/TcWW)]/[1 − (TcmDr/TcWW)]

    (3)

    Here, TcmDr and TcWW correspond to genotypic means

    under mDr and WW conditions, respectively, and TcmDr and

    TcWW correspond to POP6 means in mDr and WW conditions,

    respectively.

    Negative SSI values correspond to a decrease in the genotypic

    mean TcmDr with respect to TcWW together with an increase

    in TcmDr with respect to TcWW. SSI values equal to 0

    indicate consistent genotype means in mDr and WW conditions,

    regardless to POP6 mean responses. SSI values comprised

    between 0 and 1 indicate that Tc increase in mDr with respect

    to WW in the genotype is lower than Tc increase observed in

    the population. SSI values equal to 1 correspond to consistent

    deviations between mDr and WW conditions for both genotype

    and population means. SSI values greater than 1 indicate that

    Tc increase in mDr with respect to WW in the genotype is

    greater than Tc increase observed in the population. Therefore,

    genotypes whose index lies between 0 and 1 suggest an improved

    response to drought as compared to the overall population

    behavior.

    RESULTS

    UAV-Based HTFP for Detecting

    Response to Drought

    The UAV-based methodology allowed collection of high-

    throughput thermal data on experimental plots covering an area

    of 1.67 ha in only 22 min. While ground-truthing required

    3 h to obtain gs data on 24 trees, by performing only

    two low-elevation UAV ﬂights, we were able to capture the

    response to drought of 6716 trees with a spatial resolution

    of 6 cm × 6 cm, that is, at POP6 sub-leaf deﬁnition. The

    methodology was simple to implement in the ﬁeld: TIR

    camera required no infrared target-based calibration; standard

    GCPs were located in the experimental plots; and the UAV

    was autonomously navigated based on pre-planned mission

    (Figure 1). Data processing was almost fully automated: images

    were undistorted, mosaicked, and orthorectiﬁed with commercial

    user-friendly software. The supervision of an expert was

    mandatory to georeference the orthomosaics and to segment

    images. Image segmentation allowed for addressing the mixed-

    pixel problem and automatically identifying tree canopies

    through two independent algorithms. Both methodologies

    required an expert user to set parameters and classes based on

    visual inspection of the orthomosaics, and their implementation

    was computationally inexpensive. The extraction of tree Tc

    from radiometric orthomosaics for both treatments was executed

    within 1 h, and computational time devoted to statistical analyses

    was on the order of a few minutes.

    To validate UAV-based data, we utilized Tc of selected

    genotypes to recover the well-known inverse correlation between

    gs and the diﬀerence between Tc and Tair (Farooq et al., 2009;

    replicates. Both sets of data are ﬁtted with a linear function (R2 = 0.49). Data
    relative to mDr conditions are displayed as white symbols, whereas WW data are

    shown as black symbols. During the UAV ﬂights, Ta was equal to 28.75◦C. Statistically
    signiﬁcant (p-value ≤ 0.05) regressions are indicated with the symbol ∗.

    Costa et al., 2013; Virlet et al., 2014). Figure 3 illustrates the

    relationship between gs and the diﬀerence between Tc and the

    air temperature at the time of the UAV ﬂight (Ta) for parental

    genotypes. They were chosen due to speciﬁc morphological

    and ecological traits, which were expected to lead to divergent

    drought responses. In Figure 3A, we show eCognition-based

    data, and, in Figure 3B, we report Matlab-based data. In both

    graphs, data relative to mDr conditions are found at high values

    on the X-axis and with gs ranging from 154–434 mmol m−2 s−1

    on the Y-axis, whereas lower WW data correspond to higher gs

    values (ranging from 422 to 700 mmol m−2 s−1). Both data sets

    were ﬁtted with a linear regression, statistically signiﬁcant at an

    R2 of 0.49 (p-value < 0.05), suggesting that UAV-based thermal

    data accurately captured plant response to drought conditions.

    Tc and gs mean values, with relative standard errors, are shown

    in Table 1.

    Remarkably, both segmentation approaches led to consistent

    relationships. To further assess the robustness of the independent

    segmentation methodologies, we computed the Student’s t-test

    on POP6 genotypic mean Tc, separately for mDr and WW

    conditions. Notably, diﬀerences in data obtained with eCognition

    and Matlab were not statistically signiﬁcant for both treatments

    (WW: p-value = 0.82 and mDr: p-value = 0.36). Moreover,

    on data sets obtained with eCognition and Matlab, we also

    evaluated the Spearman’s rank correlation test, and ρ-values of

    0.98 (p-value < 0.001) were found for both WW and mDr

    conditions. Based on such strongly signiﬁcant correlation, both

    segmentation methods showed consistent Tc estimations and,

    therefore, could be interchangeably utilized to extract Tc from

    thermal images. In the succeeding ﬁgures, we report results for

    eCognition data; genotypic mean Tc along with standard error

    and SSI values for both eCognition and Matlab are provided in

    the Supplementary Tables S1, S2.

    POP6 Response to Drought

    We report results for 503 genotypes (out of the original

    691, due to tree mortality) for eCognition and Matlab-based

    segmentations. We only retained genotypes with at least three

    survived replicates in both mDr and WW conditions.

    To show within-population and within-genotype variability in

    Tc, Figure 4 displays genotypic mean Tc in WW (A) and mDr

    (B) conditions as obtained after segmentation with eCognition.

    In addition, in Figure 4C, we compared the genotypic response to

    drought by reporting the relative increase in TcmDr with respect

    to TcWW (TcmDr/TcWW). Genotypes were ordered based on

    increasing Tc (Figures 4A,B) and TcmDr/TcWW (Figure 4C).

    Dashed red lines show POP6 mean Tc (Figures 4A,B) and

    TcmDr/TcWW (Figure 4C).

    In Figure 4A, a percentage of 49.3% of genotypes lies above

    the average Tc of 19.55◦C. For Matlab, 48.4% of genotypes were

    found above a consistent average Tc of 19.55◦C. Further, the

    standard error of each genotypic mean ranges from 0.05 to 2.86

    for eCognition and from 0.05 to 3.24 for Matlab. In Figure 4B,

    a percentage of 46.3% of genotypes lies above the average Tc

    of 21.60◦C. For Matlab, 47.4% of genotypes were found above

    a similar average Tc of 21.55◦C. Further, the standard error of

    each genotypic mean ranges from 0.08 to 3.56 for eCognition and

    from 0.16 to 3.17 for Matlab. Genotypic mean Tc in mDr was

    on average warmer than in WW conditions. In WW settings, in

    eCognition, average Tc ranged from 16.62 to 23.33◦C (Matlab: Tc

    ranged from 16.62 to 23.06◦C). With regards to mDr settings, in

    eCognition, average Tc spanned from 18.16 to 26.00◦C (average

    Tc in mDr ranged from 18.14 to 24.87◦C for Matlab).

    In Figure 4C, the average ratio is equal to 1.11 for both

    eCognition and Matlab. The percentage of genotypes lying above

    such value (up to a maximum value of 1.41) is equal to 49.7 and

    48.6% for eCognition and Matlab, respectively. A total of 37.38%

    (Matlab: 38.49%) of genotypes are found between 1 and 1.11,

    whereas only 12.92% (Matlab: 12.90%) of genotypes have ratios

    ranging from 0.79 to 1.

    To inspect the frequency distribution of genotypic response

    to drought, in Figure 5 we report histograms for genotypic

    mean Tc obtained with eCognition for WW (A) and mDr (B)

    conditions. Such frequency distribution is expected to provide

    insights into POP6 average response to treatments and also the

    population response with respect to 58-861 and Poli. Both graphs

    display an approximately symmetric distribution (skewness lower

    than 0.4) with a slightly platykurtic shape (kurtosis almost

    equal to 0). Similar data distributions were found for Matlab

    (Table 2). Further, we show average Tc for 58-861 and Poli

    genotypes. In WW, parental genotypes present a similar Tc

    (58-861 equal to 19.84 and 19.80◦C; Poli equal to 19.76 and

    19.75◦C in eCognition and Matlab, respectively). Conversely, a

    greater diﬀerence in Tc between parental genotypes was found in

    mDr than in WW (58-861 equal to 20.88 and 20.93◦C; Poli equal

    to 21.78 and 21.66◦C in eCognition and Matlab, respectively).

    Diﬀerent from parental genotypes, POP6 showed a large range of

    variation within WW and mDr treatments for both segmentation

    procedures. Indeed, for eCognition, average Tc ranged from

    16.62 to 23.33◦C in WW, and from 18.20 to 26.01◦C in mDr.

    For Matlab, a very similar range of variation (with respect to

    eCognition) was found in WW (from 16.62 to 23.05◦C), whereas

    a narrower range was observed in mDr (from 18.16 to 24.84◦C).

    To quantitatively assess the eﬀect of the treatments on POP6,

    a two-way ANOVA was used to analyze Tc diﬀerences among

    genotypes, between treatments, and due to G × T interaction

    (Table 3). Notably, diﬀerences among genotypes were not

    statistically signiﬁcant. On the other hand, diﬀerences between

    treatments were statistically signiﬁcant. Finally, G × T interaction

    was not statistically signiﬁcant for both eCognition- and Matlab-

    based Tc.

    the

    between

    genetic

    and

    environmental sources of variance, H2 of the Tc was estimated.

    Within treatment analysis resulted in very low H2 for both

    eCognition (WW: 0.09, mDr: <0.01) and Matlab-based Tc

    (WW: 0.10, mDr: <0.01). Similarly, very low H2 (0.015 in

    eCognition and <0.01 in Matlab) was observed for combined

    treatments.

    Selection of Putative Drought-Tolerant

    Genotypes

    Although the genotypic eﬀect did not show a statistically

    signiﬁcant inﬂuence on trait variance, we further analyzed Tc

    data to identify genotypes with improved drought tolerance.

    Genotype performance in response to drought is illustrated

    in Figure 6. Herein, the diﬀerence between single genotypic

    mean TcmDr and POP6 TcmDr is plotted against the diﬀerence

    between genotypic mean TcmDr and TcWW conditions. Data

    are located at the tails of the distribution and correspond to a

    less frequent behavior. Genotypes are mostly evenly distributed

    above and below the X-axis; however, stressed conditions lead to

    a majority of data points lying in the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants.

    From a drought-response perspective, the fourth quadrant in

    the biplot in Figure 6 provides the most relevant information.

    Genotypes lying in the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants [436 (86.68%) in

    eCognition and 438 (86.88%) in Matlab] present a TcmDr greater

    than TcWW. While genotypes in the ﬁrst quadrant have a TcmDr

    greater than TcmDr, those in the fourth quadrant show a TcmDr

    smaller than TcmDr. A few genotypes display greater TcWW

    than TcmDr [data points in the second and third quadrants, 67

    (13.32%) out of the total number of genotypes in eCognition and

    66 (13.12%) in Matlab].

    Due to mDr treatment, in genotypes found in the fourth

    quadrant (TcmDr > TcWW and TcmDr < TcmDr), Tc increased

    less than POP6 TcmDr. This suggested the onset of acclimation

    mechanisms and, therefore, an improved response to drought

    stress with respect to the overall population. Among such

    drought-tolerant genotypes, 25% of the total number of tested

    ones (25.65% in eCognition and 25.79% in Matlab) presented an

    SSI ranging from 0 to 1, that is, the relative increase in Tc from

    WW to mDr conditions was lower than the increase observed on

    average in the population. Genotypes 58-861 and Poli were also

    located in the fourth quadrant; however, none of them had an SSI

    comprised between 0 and 1.

    DISCUSSION

    In this study, we developed a UAV-based HTFP approach to

    investigate the response of P. nigra to mDr conditions in the ﬁeld.

    We assessed the eﬀects of two water treatments on the observed

    phenotypic variance of an F2 partially inbred population of

    503 genotypes. Notably, we remotely captured high resolution

    images, whereby image pixels were several orders of magnitude

    smaller than a single tree crown, and smaller than POP6 average

    leaf area. Such a resolution could be essential to uncover

    physiological diﬀerences within single crowns. A large leaf-to-

    leaf variability has been observed for gs and leaf temperature in

    wheat (Triticum aestivum), which has led to low values of H2

    when estimated on a single-leaf basis (Rebetzke et al., 2001, 2013).

    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2012) detected in mildly stressed almond

    (Prunus dulcis) that few areas within the crown had substantial

    stomatal closure while, in the rest of the crown, the stomata were

    still open and this increased heterogeneity of the Tc. It has also

    been proposed that in cotton (Gossypium sp.) the variability of

    leaf temperature may provide important information about the

    degree of stomatal closure (Fuchs, 1990). In apple trees (Malus

    pumila) grown under drought conditions, the spatial variability

    of leaf temperature and gs was higher for the whole crown

    than for the top crown (Ngao et al., 2017). By contrast, our

    UAV-based thermal imaging provides an ideal approach for the

    collection of the large number of individual leaf temperatures,

    which are necessary for methods based on temperature frequency

    distributions simultaneously in one image, rather than point-wise

    approaches for investigating tree response to drought. We also

    expect gs to be consistently homogeneous in the upper canopy,

    that is, where gs measurements were conducted herein.

    High image resolution enabled the extraction of biologically

    meaningful data; in fact, plant leaves were attributed several

    image pixels, thus allowing accurate estimations of Tc. Such

    a rapid and non-invasive UAV-based procedure is expected

    to highly beneﬁt phenotypic-based assisted-mass selection in

    early generation screening in breeding programs for bioenergy

    purposes. UAVs could, indeed, be adopted to capture high

    resolution images over sparsely vegetated environments, such

    as orchards (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006; Sepulcre-Canto

    et al., 2007), or over very extended areas, such as natural

    forests (Torresan et al., 2016). While UAV-based phenotyping

    approaches have been already tested in agriculture, screening

    high dimensionality populations is a remarkable bottleneck in

    forestry applications and this is the ﬁrst time that these measures

    have been applied to forest species.

    Image processing at high speeds is a central challenge in

    the ﬁeld of HTFP. Thermal imaging also allows leaves to be

    distinguished from the background. If done manually, however,

    the necessary image processing can be rather labor−intensive

    and may also be dependent on subjective image interpretation.

    Our images also identiﬁed thousands of tree canopies against

    background soil and weed through two independent semi-

    automated segmentation procedures. Segmentation was utilized

    to reduce the mixed-pixel problem by extracting contours of

    areas at consistent temperatures. Then, areas relative to trees

    were identiﬁed based on visual inspection of orthomosaics

    and retained for data processing. Alternative approaches,

    which are based on manually drawing tree canopies (Virlet

    et al., 2014), would be extremely time-consuming and may

    lead to user-biased results. In this study, we developed and

    standardized a semi-automated image-based analysis procedure

    and directly applied it on thermal orthomosaics. Without relying

    on RGB images, we evaluated the sensitivity of the method to

    image segmentation by experimenting with two independent

    algorithms. Remarkably, both segmentations led to statistically

    similar tree responses to drought, thus supporting the robustness

    of the methodology.

    The level of stress induced by the treatment was fully captured

    through thermal images. This was indicated by the inverse linear

    relationship between gs and Tc. An increase in the diﬀerence of

    Tc with respect to Ta corresponded to a decrease in transpiration

    ﬂux and, therefore, to a decrease in the ratio of actual to

    potential transpiration (Farooq et al., 2009; Virlet et al., 2014).

    Similar linear regressions with slightly higher R2 have also been

    observed for orange (Citrus sinensis) (R2 = 0.70–0.78) (Zarco-

    Tejada et al., 2012; Ballester et al., 2013a), persimmon (Diospyros

    kaki) (R2 = 0.46) (Ballester et al., 2013b), and almond (Prunus

    dulcis) (R2 = 0.59–0.66) (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2012), using

    UAV, small airplanes, and ground screening techniques. However,

    comparable results for forest tree species through UAV-based

    phenomics are still undocumented.

    As already pointed out in a previous greenhouse study on early

    eﬀects of drought on P. nigra, Poli tended to quickly respond

    to stress by closing stomata due to the fact that Poli is adapted

    to dry/hot climatic conditions. However, 58-861 reacted more

    slowly to drought as it is considered better adapted to cool and

    moist climates (Cocozza et al., 2010). This behavior could be

    explained by proved geographical and environmental gradients

    of gs, with higher gs values observed in northern proveniences of

    Populus sp. (McKown et al., 2013; Kaluthota et al., 2015). This

    motivates lower Tc values for 58-861 than Poli as observed in

    Figure 5B.

    Due to drought stress, POP6 Tc increased and tended to

    the temperature of the environment as similarly seen in Mahan

    and Upchurch (1988). During the UAV ﬂights, Ta was equal

    to 28.75◦C; in WW conditions, the average diﬀerence between

    Tc and Ta was equal to −9.19◦C. Similar diﬀerences (from

    10 to 15◦C) between air and leaf temperatures have already

    been demonstrated to be plausible (Jackson et al., 1981). As

    expected, such a diﬀerence decreased to −7.14◦C in case of

    HTFP of Poplar Response to Drought

    FIGURE 6 | Biplot of genotype performance in response to drought stress.

    The difference between genotypic mean Tc (◦C) and POP6 mean Tc in mDr is

    plotted against the difference between genotypic mean Tc in mDr and WW

    conditions. Genotypes are indicated with gray circles. White circles and white

    triangles correspond to Poli and 58-861, respectively. Black crosses indicate

    genotypes with (TcmDr – TcmDr) less than 0 (genotypes are less stressed

    than the average POP6 response), and whose stress susceptibility index (SSI,

    deﬁned in Section “Stress Susceptibility Index”) lies between 0 and 1 (the

    temperature increase in mDr with respect to WW in the genotype is lower than

    the temperature increase observed in the population). Such genotypes

    suggest an improved response to drought stress as compared to the overall

    population behavior.

    mDr conditions, when transpiration ﬂux was reduced. These

    ﬁndings are consistent with previous drought studies (Zarco-

    Tejada et al., 2012; Ballester et al., 2013a,b). Also, in agreement

    with Ballester et al. (2013a,b), and Costa et al. (2013), the

    treatment resulted in a diﬀerence of 2◦C between WW and

    mDr POP6 average Tc. Figures 5A,B demonstrated that drought

    induced high phenotypic variability (large ranges of variation in

    frequency distributions). In fact, genotypic mean Tc followed

    a Gaussian distribution with a high degree of transgressive

    segregation in both treatments (thermal response of POP6 was

    extreme as compared to parental response). The high variability

    in F2 populations may be due to the transgressive segregation

    as was previously observed by Wu and Stettler (1994) and Rae

    et al. (2009) for growth-related traits in similar populations. This

    suggests that thermal response to drought is a quantitative trait

    controlled by several genes (polygenic trait) (White et al., 2007),

    and that Tc is under complex but repeatable genetic control

    (Rebetzke et al., 2013). In our study, the lack of statistically

    signiﬁcant G × T interaction suggests that POP6 response

    is consistent between both treatments (i.e., stressed genotypes

    increase their Tc, and genotypes with higher TcWW with respect

    to other genotypes also display higher TcmDr). Such consistency

    may facilitate the selection of genotypes of interest.

    Poplar Tc response to water stress was further explored by

    investigating H2. A very low H2 was observed for POP6, due

    to a large residual error and a modest genetic inﬂuence on

    the phenotypic variance. Generally, H2 of a trait varies across

    diﬀerent populations and environments (Griﬃths et al., 2000),

    and it is overestimated when G × T interaction is signiﬁcant

    (White et al., 2007). To the best of our knowledge, H2 estimation

    of Tc in forest tree species is still not reported. Yet, it was observed

    in the range from 0.05 to 0.91 in T. aestivum, with higher

    values of H2 obtained for multi-year and multi-environment

    trials (Rebetzke et al., 2013). Such a large variation supports

    the urge to conduct experiments in diﬀerent environments

    and water limitation conditions. Moreover, it is noted that

    recurrent selection is optimal for improving traits with low

    H2 (Hopkins et al., 2009). Therefore, recurrent selection of the

    herein identiﬁed putative drought-tolerant genotypes would be

    a promising approach to accumulate favorable alleles in future

    crosses of POP6.

    In addition, our technique aids in identifying genotypes that

    appear to be risk-takers versus those that are risk-averse; such an

    observation is known to occur in response to drought (Sade et al.,

    2012; Moshelion et al., 2014; Attia et al., 2015). In our experiment,

    Poli exhibits a risk-averse strategy by limiting transpiration and

    allowing Tc to increase, as opposed to 58-861, which appears

    to be a risk-taker genotype. In fact, Poli considerably increases

    its Tc from WW to mDr conditions. This response supports

    the fact that Poli could have a sensing mechanism that detects

    reduced water availability, and thereby closes stomata to avoid

    stress due to drought. Closed stomata at high light intensities

    could lead to photo-damage, and thus drought stress may become

    photo-oxidative stress, ultimately leading to biomass yield loss.

    In 58-861, a lower Tc increment (1.05◦C in eCognition and

    1.12◦C in Matlab) than Poli was observed between treatments.

    This suggests that 58-861 could employ a less conservative

    strategy, and thus, being a putative risk-taker, which developed

    an anisohydric survival strategy to drought. This adaptive choice

    may be beneﬁcial in moderate stress conditions; however, it

    may not provide any advantages in case of prolonged and

    more intense drought conditions. The likelihood of anisohydric

    genotypes to succumb earlier to drought would increase, and that

    of isohydric genotypes to more likely die of carbon starvation is a

    function of drought intensity and duration.

    Our ﬁndings show that, among trees exposed to mDr

    conditions, 63 (13.32%) out of 503 genotypes were found in

    the third quadrant in Figure 6, thus indicating greater TcWW

    than TcmDr. This behavior may be attributed to lower-density

    canopies (with short and sparse branches and with a small

    canopy surface area covered with leaves) in WW than in mDr.

    Conversely, 129 genotypes (25%) were located in the fourth

    quadrant and displayed an SSI comprised between 0 and 1. Even

    though gs measurements are required to validate this response,

    these POP6 genotypes could be considered more risk-takers,

    which supposedly maintain high gs and lower Tc. However,

    whether or not these risk-taker genotypes could be considered

    drought tolerant would depend on the period and severity of

    drought, and on the rate at which plants recover from drought

    exposure (Sade et al., 2012). For example, in Alvarez et al. (2007),

    HTFP of Poplar Response to Drought

    anisohydric purple lovegrass (Eragrostis spectabilis) maintained

    higher gs and CO2 assimilation, and showed better performance

    than isohydric miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis) plants under

    optimal and mild-to-moderate drought conditions, but little

    diﬀerence was noted when both plants were subjected to severe

    drought. A greater research eﬀort is currently needed to better

    understand the physiological mechanisms involved when plants

    tend to be risk-takers in stressed and risk-averse in non-stressed

    conditions.

    Even if genotypic eﬀect was not statistically signiﬁcant,

    risk-taking genotypes accounting for 25% of the tested ones

    support that crossing genotypes with divergent morphological

    and ecological traits, such as 58-861 and Poli, resulted in

    augmented phenotypic variability (see also the large ranges of

    variation in Figure 5) in the early F2 POP6 generation. Higher-

    order crossings with diﬀerential breeding techniques based on

    selection are expected to lead to higher H2 and improved genetic

    gains. Promising genotypes were capable of controlling stomatal

    closure to raise their Tc by less than 2◦C with respect to

    non-stressed conditions (SSI ranging from 0 to 1). Interestingly,

    in Rizhsky et al. (2002, 2004), upon similar drought conditions,

    leaf temperature increased by 2–5◦C. This supports our ﬁnding

    that trees whose Tc increases by less than 2◦C showed a better

    response within POP6.

    The extensive HTP executed in this study was done in

    drought trials under natural ﬁeld conditions. The results

    of this study prove that this methodology enabled high-

    throughput data analysis in the ﬁeld upon fast and non-

    invasive acquisition of thermal images. Notably, this approach

    allowed eﬃcient and precise phenotyping of large population

    of individuals at the same time, thus minimizing the inﬂuence

    of variable meteorological conditions on control (in this case

    WW) and treated (in this case mDr) trees. Image resolution

    was remarkably higher than in previous studies (Berni et al.,

    2009) and highly suﬃcient for accurately characterizing tree

    response even at crown and leaf levels. We indicate that ﬂight

    elevation was also standardized to 25 m to ensure high image

    deﬁnition while guaranteeing that UAV rotor downwash did

    not disturb Tc. Finally, the degree of automation employed

    in the developed HTFP method is highly desirable and will

    be widely adopted in ﬁeld-based phenomics for forest trees

    genetics and genomics research. Since Tc is strongly related

    to gs, photosynthetic rate (Way and Oren, 2010), and leaf

    water potential (Testi et al., 2008), UAV-based thermal sensing

    may be an eﬃcient, robust, and high-throughput tool for

    indirectly screening breeding populations, for selecting drought-

    tolerant, as well as risk-takers and risk-averse genotypes. This

    methodology is also promising toward monitoring the dynamics

    of stomatal movement in response to environmental stresses

    through rapid and repeated surveys. Improved knowledge of

    stress response will also be enabled through the synergistic

    integration of UAV remote sensing with more direct ground-

    based measurements (i.e., leaf ﬂuorescence, leaf gas exchange,

    leaf water potential, leaf morphology, tree sap ﬂow, and

    biomass production). Coupled with ground-penetrating radar,

    ﬁeld-based phenomics will accelerate screening for drought

    tolerance by multi-scale analysis of root, crown, and leaf

    traits. Currently, UAVs have been outﬁtted with multispectral,

    hyperspectral, thermal, RGB, and near-infrared cameras, which

    are useful to evaluate plant response to stress (Costa et al.,

    2013; Shi et al., 2016). Future technological ameliorations

    will aﬀord unprecedented measurements such as chlorophyll

    ﬂuorescence imaging and 3D mapping using light detection and

    ranging (LIDAR) sensors, directly from drones, thus opening

    novel avenues in high-throughput stress phenotyping in forest

    trees. Promising examples of this vision can also include

    UAV integrated platforms equipped with multiple sensors for

    simultaneous data collection.

    In breeding programs, this new aerial screening method may

    sensibly alleviate the eﬀect of environmental factors such as

    varying exposure to sunlight according to time of the day, local

    climatic conditions, background radiation due to soil vegetative

    cover and soil water content, being precise, automated and quick.

    In fact, utilizing highly sensitive radiometrically calibrated TIR

    cameras may speed up tree screening, thus enabling repeated

    observations over longer periods of time and larger scale areas.

    Furthermore, augmenting breeders’ visual deﬁnition by selecting

    low ﬂight altitudes may provide novel insights on the response to

    drought stress at the single leaf scale.

    CONCLUSION

    In this study, we developed a high-resolution and high-

    throughput

    UAV-based

    phenomics

    method

    to

    investigate

    drought in the ﬁeld. We applied this screening method to

    precisely and eﬃciently assess the response to drought of a

    P. nigra F2 population consisting of 503 genotypes planted on

    an area of 1.67 ha. We captured thermal images of stressed and

    non-stressed trees from an elevation of 25 m. We reconstructed

    thermal mosaics and extracted the average Tc by using two

    independent image segmentation techniques. We statistically

    analyzed

    genotypic

    temperatures,

    and

    identiﬁed

    putative

    drought-tolerant genotypes. This newly developed approach

    enabled high resolution thermal orthomosaics from quick

    UAV-based acquisitions and simultaneous screening of a

    signiﬁcant number of individuals.

    Two segmentation techniques for accurately analyzing TIR

    images, one developed in-house using Matlab, and another

    relying on commercial software eCognition, were successfully

    implemented to eliminate the mixed-pixel problem. They both

    led to consistent results, indicating that it is possible to

    use HTFP-based thermography for the screening of tolerance

    to drought stress in forest trees. However, considering the

    complexity of drought tolerance, we suggest it can only act

    as an accessory means in an active breeding program for

    drought by contributing signiﬁcantly to phenotyping of tree

    response to water stress. Future studies will aim at extending

    the methodology to rapidly generate environmentally nuanced

    temporal measurements of physiological diﬀerences to contribute

    to predictive environmental stress response models. Through

    the approach developed here, candidate genes for drought stress

    responses can also be identiﬁed when this HTFP is combined

    with advanced genomics approaches.

    HTFP of Poplar Response to Drought

    Based on our analysis, a good correlation was found

    between UAV-based parental genotypic mean Tc and ground-

    truth gs measurements. Genotypic mean temperatures exhibited

    a Gaussian distribution centered about parental behavior.

    Furthermore, the statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences observed

    between treatments were attributed to environmental conditions.

    Finally, based on SSI values, 25% of the population exhibited

    increase in temperature under mDr conditions by less than

    2◦C, and, thus, can be regarded as candidate drought-tolerant

    genotypes.

    The use of UAV for ﬁeld-based tree phenotyping under

    drought conditions is novel, but is expected to become

    an important tool for improving eﬃciency in forest-tree

    breeding for climate change. To date, no studies have been

    carried out attempting to use UAV-based HTFP for forest

    tree phenotyping in managed stress trials in which speciﬁc

    deploy such platform in a breeding program. Thanks to

    its high resolution aerial imagery, accurate data processing,

    and

    shows

    promise as a precise and eﬃcient tool for use in phenomics

    \ Despite being the driest inhabited continent, Australia has one of the highest\
    \ per capita\nwater consumptions in the world. In addition, instead of having\
    \ ﬁt-for-purpose water supplies\n(using different qualities of water for different\
    \ applications), highly treated drinking water is used\nfor nearly all of Australia’s\
    \ urban water supply needs, including landscape irrigation. The water\nrequirement\
    \ of urban landscapes, particularly urban parklands, is of growing concern. The\
    \ estimation\nof evapotranspiration (ET) and subsequently plant water requirements\
    \ in urban vegetation needs to\nconsider the heterogeneity of plants, soils, water,\
    \ and climate characteristics. This research contributes\nto a broader effort\
    \ to establish sustainable irrigation practices within the Adelaide Parklands\
    \ in\nAdelaide, South Australia. In this paper, two practical ET estimation approaches\
    \ are compared to\na detailed Soil Water Balance (SWB) analysis over a one year\
    \ period. One approach is the Water\nUse Classiﬁcation of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS)\
    \ method, which is based on expert opinion on\nthe water needs of different classes\
    \ of landscape plants. The other is a remote sensing approach\nbased on the Enhanced\
    \ Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n\
    (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. Both methods require knowledge of reference\
    \ ET calculated\nfrom meteorological data. The SWB determined that plants consumed\
    \ 1084 mm¨ yr´1 of water in ET\nwith an additional 16% lost to drainage past the\
    \ root zone, an amount sufﬁcient to keep salts from\naccumulating in the root\
    \ zone. ET by MODIS EVI was 1088 mm¨ yr´1, very close to the SWB estimate,\nwhile\
    \ WUCOLS estimated the total water requirement at only 802 mm¨ yr´1, 26% lower\
    \ than the SWB\nestimate and 37% lower than the amount actually added including\
    \ the drainage fraction. Individual\nmonthly ET by MODIS was not accurate, but\
    \ these errors were cancelled out to give good agreement\non an annual time step.\
    \ We conclude that the MODIS EVI method can provide accurate estimates of\nurban\
    \ water requirements in mixed landscapes large enough to be sampled by MODIS imagery\
    \ with\n250-m resolution such as parklands and golf courses.\nKeywords: evapotranspiration;\

    \ (ET) Estimates for Urban Landscapes\nThe UN Population Reference Bureau [1]\
    \ states that 51% of the world population is settled in\nurban areas and that\
    \ this ratio will reach 60% by 2030 [2]. Rapid urban population growth necessitates\n\
    sustainable urbanisation planning and management. To avoid severe environmental\
    \ consequences and\nclimate change impacts, green urbanisation needs to be facilitated\
    \ [3]. Preserving and even expanding\nurban green spaces is one of the principles\
    \ of green urbanisation. Despite this, the water management\nof urban green spaces\
    \ such as inner-city parklands compared with natural vegetation and agricultural\n\
    areas has received much less attention [4]. In addition, the increasing application\
    \ of wastewater\nirrigation in urban green spaces also highlights the need for\
    \ sustainable irrigation management of\nurban vegetation [5–7].\nWater demand\
    \ and subsequent evapotranspiration (ET) through vegetation is a fundamental\n\
    concept of sustainable irrigation [8]. “The combination of two separate processes\
    \ whereby water\nis lost on the one hand from the soil surface by evaporation\
    \ and on the other hand from the crop\nby transpiration is referred to as evapotranspiration”\
    \ [9]. In many agricultural systems, there is\na uniformity of density, height,\
    \ and water availability which facilitates a conventional approach\nfor ET measurement,\
    \ although these approaches are not without their challenges. In the case of\n\
    non-agricultural systems, such as inner-city gardens and urban parks, the heterogeneous\
    \ nature of\nvegetation and landscapes, together with the high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability of soil and water\ncharacteristics, and the variability of management\
    \ and watering practices [10] contribute to greatly\nincreased complexity in the\
    \ ET estimation of urban vegetation [11,12]. This is of even more concern\nwhen\
    \ wastewater irrigation is occurring due to the risk of nutrient leaching that,\
    \ in the long term, can\nresult in soil and groundwater contamination [10,13].\n\
    In this study, we compared two practical methods for ET estimation in Veale Gardens,\
    \ an\nurban park in Adelaide, Australia with a detailed estimation of ET based\
    \ on a soil water balance\n(SWB) approach. One method was the Water Use Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Landscape Species (WUCOLS), an\nobservation-based program calibrated for\
    \ the type of landscape plants and local climate at the study\nsite. The second\
    \ method was based on satellite imagery combined with meteorological data. Our\n\
    goal was to ﬁnd a reliable yet convenient method for estimating actual water requirements\
    \ of urban\nlandscapes in a hot Mediterranean climate.\n1.2. Soil Water Balance\n\
    For almost a century, ET has been determined through monitoring of temporal changes\n\
    in soil moisture status.\nSoil sampling and gravimetric analysis are primary techniques\
    \ of soil\nmoisture measurement. These techniques have been gradually improved\
    \ through the application\nof electromagnetic devices such as capacitance-based\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) and neutron\nthermalization methods. The SWB\
    \ technique is one of the conventional methods of ET estimation\nthat has beneﬁtted\
    \ from the application of these electromagnetic devices in soil water monitoring.\n\
    SWB is an account of all volumes of water added, removed, or stored over a given\
    \ time interval [14].\nPrecipitation or irrigation that reaches the soil surface\
    \ may inﬁltrate or run off. The inﬁltrated water\nmay evaporate from the soil\
    \ or be captured by vegetation where it is either used by plants for growth,\n\
    transpired from stomata, or drained from the effective root zone [15]. Monitoring\
    \ all these inﬂows and\noutﬂows is the fundamental principle of the SWB method.\n\
    The SWB method has - sources of error and inaccuracy, particularly when applied\
    \ in large areas.\nFinding representative sample points that perfectly characterize\
    \ soil water properties, such as drainage,\nsoil bulk density, water holding capacity,\
    \ and saturated hydraulic conductivity, is challenging. This\nis of more concern\
    \ in urban landscape plantings due to the heterogeneity of vegetation, soil, water,\n\
    and urban microclimates. Testi et al. [16] compared the SWB and eddy covariance\
    \ methods in an\norchard. They recommended that ET estimation of young orchards\
    \ should be a mechanistic approach\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 492\n3 of 15\nthat deals\
    \ with evaporation from soil and plants separately. Kizito et al. [17] conﬁrmed\
    \ the suitability\nof the application of the SWB for native shrubs. Scott [18]\
    \ compared the eddy covariance and SWB\nmethods in a watershed covering shrub\
    \ land, grass land, and savannah sites. The results from the two\nmethods showed\
    \ a better agreement in drier years. Trambouze et al. [19] compared ET estimation\
    \ of\na row-cropped vineyard using the SWB and energy balance methods. They reported\
    \ that the SWB\nmust be used over a period longer than one week (preferably a\
    \ year or more) to provide acceptable ET\nestimation. While the SWB approach can\
    \ provide accurate data, it is not practical to apply it to routine,\nnear-real-time\
    \ monitoring of landscape ET, as is needed for irrigation scheduling.\n1.3. The\
    \ WUCOLS Method\nNouri et al. [20] compared three observational-based methods\
    \ of ET estimation in urban landscape\nvegetation. Three adjustment factors, or\
    \ landscape plant coefﬁcients, for reference ET (ETo), namely\nWUCOLS, plant factor\
    \ (PF), and a crop stress factor for the Irrigated Public Open Space (IPOS_2008)\n\
    method, were estimated. The predicted irrigation rates using these three landscape\
    \ factors were\ncompared with actual irrigation rates for Veale Gardens, the site\
    \ of the present study.\nIn the IPOS-2008 method, the landscape factor is the\
    \ product of a plant factor and plant stress\nfactor that varies from 0.4 for\
    \ passive recreational turf to 1.0 for elite sport turf. This method is mainly\n\
    focused on turf grasses. In this approach, plant evapotranspiration (ETL) is calculated\
    \ by relating ETo\nto a turf grass coefﬁcient (Kc) and a crop stress factor (Kst).\n\
    ETL “ ETo ˆ Kc ˆ Kst\n(1)\nThe Plant Water Use Factor (PF), which deﬁnes a landscape\
    \ coefﬁcient for the minimum irrigation\nneeded to maintain acceptable function\
    \ aesthetics aspects, was also tested. This method was very\nlimited in species\
    \ and did not cover a majority of species in the study area.\nETL “ ETo ˆ PF\n\
    (2)\nThe results conﬁrmed that the WUCOLS method produced the best estimation\
    \ of urban vegetation\nwater requirements for the study area, so it was adopted\
    \ for the present study. WUCOLS is based on\nthe expert opinion of a panel of\
    \ 36 landscape horticulturists regarding water requirements for different\nclasses\
    \ of landscape plants, and it is calibrated for local conditions using estimates\
    \ of reference ET\n(ETo), plant types and species, vegetation density, and microclimate\
    \ factors:\nET “ KL ˆ ETo\n(3)\nwhere KL is a coefﬁcient similar to the crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ used for agricultural crops, but incorporating\nfactors speciﬁc for urban landscaping\
    \ plants. ETo is based on meteorological data and represents the\nmaximum ET expected\
    \ for a well-watered grass crop [9]. The WUCOLS method is practical because it\n\
    does not require actual local measurements of ET. However, it is qualitative in\
    \ the sense that it depends\non expert opinion rather than measured properties\
    \ of the landscape, and it is difﬁcult to extend to\nlandscapes beyond those for\
    \ which it was developed and validated.\n1.4. Remote Sensing Method\nSatellite\
    \ imagery has been used to estimate ET in agricultural and natural ecosystems\
    \ for the\npast 25 years [21]. Vegetation index methods, as applied in this study,\
    \ use optical bands to estimate\ncanopy greenness, which is directly related to\
    \ the transpiration component of ET. These methods\nare appropriate for monitoring\
    \ urban landscapes where maintaining healthy green vegetation is\nthe ultimate\
    \ goal [11,12]. Nouri et al. [22] showed that ET could be predicted at the study\
    \ site\nusing high-resolution WorldView 2 imagery by creating masks denoting individual\
    \ classes of plants.\nHowever, WorldView 2 images are expensive, and digitizing\
    \ individual landscape units is tedious.\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 492\n4 of 15\n\
    A much simpler remote sensing method using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\
    \ (MODIS)\nsensors on the Terra satellite was also tested by Nouri et al. [22]\
    \ and yielded promising results, but\nactual ET rates were not available for comparison\
    \ with any of the methods.\n1.5. The Present Study\nThis study compared SWB, WUCOLS,\
    \ and MODIS methods for estimating ET at Veale Gardens.\nThe SWB method was accepted\
    \ as the most accurate reference estimate of ET since it measured all input\n\
    and outputs; the two practical methods were compared to SWB estimates to determine\
    \ the best method\nfor routine monitoring of ET for parks and other urban landscapes\

    \ SWB equation uses conservation of mass principles in a closed system to describe\
    \ the water\nﬂow in and out of a hydrological domain [24,25]. Plant water requirements\
    \ are supplied through soil\nwater storage (∆S), which is the residual of input\
    \ and output water to the soil (Equation (4)).\nP ` I ` W ´ ET ´ R ´ D “ ˘ r∆Ss.\n\
    (4)\nThe input and output components are precipitation (P), irrigation (I), upward\
    \ contribution from\nwater table (W), surface runoff (R), and drainage (D) [26–28].\
    \ To estimate the in-situ ET of mixed\nvegetation in VG, the differences between\
    \ the total amounts of input water (irrigation and precipitation)\nand the amounts\
    \ of output water (soil moisture changes, drainage, and runoff) were measured.\n\
    2.1.2. Precipitation and Irrigation Data\nPrecipitation data during the experiment\
    \ were collected by an automated wireless weather station\nlocated in VG less\
    \ than 200 m away from the sampling points. An automatic sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system\nwas used in VG. Irrigation data was provided by Adelaide City Council\
    \ (ACC) for the study period.\nThree different pop-up sprinkler types (Hunter\
    \ I-31, Hunter I-20 ultra, and Hunter institutional) were\nused. The irrigation\
    \ rates of the sprinklers varied from 11.9 mm/h to 23.8 mm/h depending on the\n\
    pressure and effective radius. ACC, who manage the Adelaide Parklands, reported\
    \ an irrigation\nefﬁciency (uniformity of application) of 70% for the entire park\
    \ (ACC, personal communication).\n2.1.3. Soil Moisture Content Measurement Using\
    \ Neutron Probes\nThe moisture status in the soil proﬁle was monitored using a\
    \ Neutron Moisture Meter (NMM),\nwhich is a method that has been broadly employed\
    \ to quantify soil water content in research and\ncommercial applications [29–32].\
    \ NMMs contain a radioactive source that emits fast neutrons and\na detector of\
    \ slow neutrons. Both the source and the detector are placed in a probe. Soil\
    \ protons\n(commonly soil water) and fast neutron interactions slow down by collision\
    \ with hydrogen in the\nsoil water molecules, and the returned signal is captured\
    \ and quantiﬁed by the NMM probe. In VG,\nelectro-galvanized access tubes with\
    \ internal diameters of 50 mm were installed at the four sample\npoints of L1,\
    \ L2, L3, and L4 (Figure 1). These four points were selected from different vegetation\n\
    densities and species status. The tubes were capped on top to prevent entry of\
    \ any soil, water, or\nanimals. The NMM readings were taken monthly at 0.2-m depth\
    \ intervals down to 1 m and then at\n0.5-m intervals down to 4 m.\nConsidering\
    \ the inherent heterogeneity of soil and water conditions from site to site, an\
    \ in-situ\nNMM calibration was conducted [29,31]. The NMM calibration exercise\
    \ and all the subsequent NMM\nreadings utilized a CPN503 DR Hydro-probe and 32\
    \ s count rates. A standard count was undertaken\nby taking a NMM reading of a\
    \ suspended access tube in the middle of a water drum. A ﬁeld calibration\nwas\
    \ conducted by taking NMM readings at the same interval in the monitoring tubes\
    \ down to 4 m. The\nguideline by Goyne and Williams [31] was employed to follow\
    \ a step-by-step procedure of installing,\nsetting up, calibrating, reading, and\
    \ processing the data of NMM. Yao et al. [33] employed a similar\napproach of\
    \ calibration. Destructive soil sampling down to a 4 m depth next to the access\
    \ tube (20 cm)\nenabled measurement of the gravimetric soil moisture content for\
    \ each interval corresponding to the\nNMM reading locations. This procedure was\
    \ repeated for two soil moisture conditions representing the\nupper and lower\
    \ limits of soil moisture in VG (total of 20 data points). Statistical analysis\
    \ of the NMM\nrecords in the upper limit (soil saturation condition) and the lower\
    \ limit (soil dry condition) produced a\ncalibration curve relating soil volumetric\
    \ moisture to count ratio and conﬁrmed a calibration equation\nthat was developed\
    \ for VG:\nSoil Moisture pcm3¨ cm´3q “ 80.9CR ´ 30.0, r2 “ 0.83, p ă 0.001 CV\

    \ Using Lysimeters\nTwo zero-tension pan lysimeters were installed in VG to measure\
    \ the drainage during the period\nNovember 2011 to November 2012. Based on the\
    \ landscape variation in the park, two landscape zones\nwere deﬁned, one being\
    \ largely covered with turf grasses containing a few trees and shrubs and the\n\
    second zone consisting mostly trees and shrubs with intermittent turf grasses.\
    \ Lysimeters were placed\nhorizontally and 100 cm below the ground to capture\
    \ water draining from the above lying undisturbed\nsoil. The lysimeter in landscape\
    \ zone 1 was located below turf grasses with the closest tree 15 m away.\nThe\
    \ lysimeter in landscape zone 2 was buried close to a tree with effective root\
    \ zone of one meter. The\ninstallation method for the pan lysimeters is described\
    \ in detail by Nouri et al. [13].\n2.1.5. Monitoring of Water Table Heights and\
    \ Surface Runoff\nSince the commissioning in 2010 of the recycled wastewater irrigation\
    \ scheme used in the Adelaide\nParklands, groundwater levels have been measured\
    \ at least every three months using a calibrated\nwater level probe to take into\
    \ account the upward contribution from the water table (W) in the SWB\nequation.\
    \ Surface runoff is mainly generated by the two mechanisms of saturation excess\
    \ runoff and\ninﬁltration excess runoff [34].\nPrevious studies showed that surface\
    \ runoff was not a factor in the water balance [35].\nPirone et al. [36] stated\
    \ that runoff can be neglected in the SWB approach in dry seasons. Moreover, we\n\
    did not observe any surface runoff during the study period.\n2.2. Water Use Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS)\nThe water demand of urban vegetation is directly\
    \ related to the amount of water that is lost\nthrough the landscape evapotranspiration\
    \ process, which is fulﬁlled by effective precipitation (PE) and\nnet irrigation\
    \ (IN):\nIN “ ET ´ PE\n(6)\nNet irrigation is the required water to satisfy vegetation\
    \ evapotranspiration excluding effective\nrainfall. The heterogeneity of mixed\
    \ vegetation in urban environments provides a situation that\ncannot be readily\
    \ replicated by conventional crop coefﬁcient methods. WUCOLS was developed by\n\
    Costello and Jones [37] as a more practical approach for estimating ET from urban\
    \ landscape plantings.\nWUCOLS introduces an adjustment factor to ETo in order\
    \ to estimate the ET of urban landscape\nplantings, as expressed in Equation (3).\n\
    KL takes into account a species factor (Ks) that accounts for differences in vegetation\
    \ species,\na density factor (Kd) that accounts for the variation of canopy cover/vegetation\
    \ density, and a\nmicroclimate factor (Kmc) that accounts for the effects of typical\
    \ urban features such as buildings,\npaving, and shading (Equation (7)).\nKL “\
    \ Ks ˆ Kd ˆ Kmc.\n(7)\nA comprehensive description of assigning species, density,\
    \ and microclimate factors for VG is\nreported by Nouri et al. [20]. It should\
    \ be noted that VG is operated by the Adelaide City Council,\nirrigating by an\
    \ adequate resource of the recycled wastewater. Therefore, soil moisture stress\
    \ is not\nincluded, and plants are assumed to not be water-stressed.\n2.3. MODIS\
    \ ET Method\nMODIS images are obtained at a near-daily rate for most areas of\
    \ the Earth. MODIS MOD\n13-gridded 250-m-resolution vegetation index products\
    \ are supplied to end-users by NASA as\natmospherically and radiometrically corrected\
    \ 16-day composite images (for details of image\nacquisition and processing see\
    \ [38]. MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images for the years\n2000 to 2013\
    \ were obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory DAAC site (Oak Ridge National\n\
    Remote Sens. 2016, 8, 492\n7 of 15\nLaboratory, 2014). The pixel selection tool\
    \ at the website displays the approximate MODIS pixel\nfootprint on a high-resolution\
    \ Google Earth image; hence, it is possible to positively co-locate ground\nsites\
    \ with pixel acquisition sites if images or maps are available for the ground\
    \ site locations. A single\nEVI pixel wholly contained within the Veale Gardens\
    \ was obtained for this study. Pixels for two\nadjacent parks, Lundie Garden and\
    \ Kurranga Park, where obtained for comparison. The choice of\nEVI as the VI product\
    \ was based on its superior performance in predicting ET, as noted in previous\n\
    studies [39]. EVI is calculated from band reﬂectance values as:\nEVI “ 2.5 ˆ pNIR\
    \ ´ Redq{p1 ` NIR ` p6 ˆ Red ´ 7.5 ˆ Blueqq\n(8)\nwhere the blue and red coefﬁcients,\
    \ 6 and 7.5, minimize residual aerosol variations [40,41].\nET has been accurately\
    \ estimated by combining MODIS EVI with knowledge of atmospheric\nwater demand,\
    \ as estimated by at a number of agricultural and riparian phreatophyte communities\
    \ in\ndiverse locations [42,43]. We used an algorithm derived from the crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ method of estimating\nET of agricultural crops, where:\nET “ Kc ˆ ETo\n(9)\n\
    where ETo is reference (potential) ET calculated from meteorological data, and\
    \ Kc is an empirical\ncoefﬁcient relating ET of a particular crop to ETo, typically\
    \ on a monthly basis through the crop growth\ncycle [9]. A satellite VI can replace\
    \ Kc in Equation (3), giving an estimate of ET based on a measure\nof the actual\
    \ status of the crop at the time of satellite overpass (reviewed for different\
    \ natural and\nagricultural ecosystems by Glenn et al., 2010):\nET “ fVI ˆ ETo\n\
    (10)\nwhere fVI is a function describing the relationship between the VI and ET,\
    \ determined by regression of\nVI with the measured values of ET and ETo, as from\
    \ moisture Bowen Ration ﬂux towers, lysimeters, or\nwater balance studies. The\
    \ relationship between ET and VI is not necessarily linear because VIs are\ntypically\
    \ non-linear with respect to Leaf Area Index (LAI). The algorithm we used was\
    \ [43]:\nET “ ETo ˆ 1.65 p1 ´ e´2.25EVIq ´ 0.169\n(11)\nThe term (1´e´2.25EVI)\
    \ takes the form of the Beers–Lambert Law as applied to light absorption by\n\
    a canopy, with ´2.25 ˆ EVI replacing LAI. The numerical coefﬁcients were derived\
    \ from the equation\nof best ﬁt between ground-based ET from literature data for\
    \ four irrigation districts and four riparian\nforest in arid and semiarid districts\
    \ in Spain, Australia, and the Western U.S. The algorithm reproduced\nannual ground\
    \ estimates of ET with an average error of 5.5%, ranging from 2.9%–9.3% across\
    \ sites\nand with an overall bias of ´5.3% across sites [43]. We applied this\
    \ algorithm to the Veale Gardens\nsite in this study. A previous study in VG [22]\
    \ showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between\nthe ﬁeld-based approach of\
    \ WUCOLS and remote sensing-based approach using high-resolution\nWorldView 2.\
    \ This strong relationship validated a remotely sensed ET estimation approach.\
    \ Further\nanalysis using coarse resolution MODIS imageries strongly supported\
    \ the feasibility of vegetation\nindices to estimate ET rate of heterogeneous\
    \ urban vegetation.\n3. Results\n3.1. SWB Components\nTotal amount of input water\

    To complete the SWB data requirements, estimates of runoff, groundwater changes,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture storage changes were needed. The depth to groundwater is\
    \ approximately 4 m below the\nground surface, as reported by Martin et al. [35].\
    \ Consequently, there is no input contribution from the\nwater table height in\
    \ the SWB equation. To minimize the risk of excess runoff, an existing automated\n\
    irrigation system was used in VG, and this was managed using real-time meteorological\
    \ data together\nwith soil moisture probe monitoring. Accordingly, there were\
    \ no runoff losses measured during the\nstudy period. Changes in soil moisture\
    \ in the top 4 m of the soil proﬁle were factored into the SWB\ncalculation, but\
    \ the soil was always moist, and changes were small over the one-year study period,\n\
    with soil moisture ranging only from 1051–1175 mm (equal to 0.262–0.293 cm3¨ cm´3).\
    \ While no runoff\nwas observed in previous studies, we did not directly measure\

    \ selected following a survey by a panel\nof six horticulturists who work for\

    \ drought tolerance, moderate tolerance to drought, and drought sensitivity, in\
    \ order to\nmaintain acceptable health and appearance. The panel similarly assigned\

    \ 15\n4. Discussion\nThe SWB shows that water management at Veale Gardens efﬁciently\
    \ maintains the plants without\nover-irrigating the landscaping [13,20]. The observed\
    \ leaching fraction of 0.16 is a reasonable value to\nkeep soil salinity within\
    \ the range tolerated by the mixed plantings [45].\nIn summary, two ET estimation\
    \ approaches of observational-based WUCOLS and the remote\nsensing-based approach\
    \ of EVI from MODIS imagery combined with ETo were applied in the\nheterogeneous\
    \ urban vegetation of the VG within the Adelaide Parklands over a year.\nThese\n\
    approaches were compared with the ﬁeld-based approach of SWB. The SWB determination\
    \ of annual\nwater demand was 1084 mm with an additional 16% drainage loss. Annual\
    \ ET by EVI from MODIS\nwas 1088 mm, 0.3% more than SWB estimate. The total annual\
    \ water requirement estimated by\nWUCOLS was only 802 mm, 26% lower than the SWB\
    \ and 37% lower than actual irrigation rate,\nincluding the drainage fraction.\
    \ In the SWB, the range of soil moisture was small (CV = 11.2%)\nindicating urban\
    \ vegetation in VG was not water-stressed during the study period. In other words,\n\
    our outcomes were mainly affected by vegetation status and meteorological inﬂuences\
    \ rather than\nsoil moisture availability. It should be noted that the individual\
    \ monthly ET by EVI-MODIS was not\naccurate, but these errors were cancelled out\
    \ to give good agreement on an annual time step. Our\nresults show that the EVI-MODIS\
    \ method can provide an accurate estimation of annual ET in urban\nheterogeneous\
    \ urban landscapes. However, the area needs to be large enough to be sampled by\
    \ 250-m\nspatial resolution by MODIS imagery. Nouri et al. [22] found NDVI from\
    \ high-resolution WorldView\n2 imager to be a reliable and effective approach\
    \ for the ET estimation of mixed urban vegetation.\nKumar [46] analyzed RS-based\
    \ VIs to improve the water resource management of urban environments.\nHe found\
    \ VIs valuable indicators for studying soil moisture and ET.\nSustainable irrigation\
    \ and water management necessitates a precise knowledge of ET, particularly\n\
    in a mixed vegetation environment. This study investigated the important challenges\
    \ of determining a\nreliable and practical approach to measuring the water demand\
    \ of heterogeneous urban vegetation,\nwhich is not widely available in the irrigation\
    \ literature. A conventional approach for measuring plant\nwater requirements\
    \ is used in many agricultural systems, as there is a uniformity of crop species\
    \ and\nheight. However, this approach is still not without its challenges. Estimating\
    \ ET and subsequently\nplant water requirements in non-agricultural systems such\
    \ as urban parks, forests, and riparian\nsystems is made more complex due to the\
    \ wide variation in vegetation types involved, including trees,\nshrubs, and grasses,\
    \ with different species, vigour/stress, density, height, microclimate, and water\n\
    demand/availability.\nAllen et al. [47] assessed the accuracy of different methods\
    \ for estimating ET and irrigation\nrequirements. Methods included lysimeters,\
    \ eddy covariance and Bowen ratio ﬂux towers, soil\nwater balance, and satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing, among others. All methods were subject to errors\nand uncertainties,\
    \ which translated into economic losses due to misinformed water management.\n\
    Lysimeter and soil water balance methods had the highest accuracy, with annual\
    \ errors of 5% and\n10%, respectively. Hence, the good agreement between the SWB\
    \ method and the MODIS results in the\npresent study are encouraging. However,\
    \ based on literature results, remote sensing methods had a\nrange of accuracy\
    \ of 5% to 30% depending on method and type of ecosystem. In a previous study,\
    \ the\nMODIS method used here produced results within 5% of the eddy covariance\
    \ ﬂux tower results on an\nannual basis [43], similar to the agreement with the\
    \ SWB results in this study.\nHowever, we do not recommend SWB as a practical\
    \ approach to studying ET of large-scale urban\nparklands, as it is costly and\
    \ needs extensive time, high-level technicians skilled in building and\ninstalling\
    \ drainage compartments, and someone with a radiation license to work with Neutron\n\
    Moisture Meter probes.\nThe high spatiotemporal variation of heterogeneous mixed\
    \ landscape\nvegetation areas introduces sources of errors and biases in representative\
    \ sample points in measuring\nwater balance factors such as drainage and soil\
    \ moisture. Moreover, there are always some restrictions\nwhen undertaking ﬁeldwork\
    \ in public parks that limit the number of sampling points and the duration\n\
    of the study. This research team has investigated the possible capability of remotely\
    \ sensed vegetation\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 492\n12 of 15\nindices, such as NDVI\
    \ from WorldView 2 and EVI from MODIS, to estimate the ET of heterogeneous\nurban\
    \ vegetation in VG. We found high-resolution NDVI to be a precise and valid indicator\
    \ in seasonal\nET estimation. However, due to the high cost associated with high\
    \ resolution imagery, we examined\nMODIS EVI as an alternative. Our results showed\
    \ that the MODIS EVI method works very well\nfor annual ET estimation in urban\
    \ parklands. This ﬁnding supports ﬁndings of other remotely\nsensed vegetation\
    \ indices as a feasible ET estimator in unstressed conditions [9,48]. For example,\n\
    Maselli et al. [49] discuss relevant limitations of ET estimation in mixed, water-stressed\
    \ ecosystems such\nas forests and reported a satisfactory accuracy in using vegetation\
    \ indices from MODIS. Wang et al. [50]\nstudied the water balance cycle over Australia.\
    \ They found satellite products including ET from\nMODIS to be a suitable estimate\
    \ in large time scales of seasonal or annual balance.\n5. Conclusions\nIt would\
    \ be impractical to conduct detailed SWB studies in all the parklands in Adelaide\
    \ as an\nirrigation management tool. MODIS imagery combined with ETo accurately\
    \ reproduced annual ET\nas determined by the SWB, while WUCOLS underestimated\
    \ both ET and total water requirements.\nThe KL coefﬁcient in WUCOLS could be\
    \ adjusted (increased) to force agreement with the SWB, but\nthis would be a static\
    \ estimate of water requirements. On the other hand, water application rates,\
    \ and\nsubsequently their impact on EVI and ET tested by the MODIS method, could\
    \ be adjusted to ﬁne tune\nirrigation practices.\nMODIS vegetation index imagery\
    \ is currently available as pre-processed, atmospherically\ncorrected products\
    \ at no cost; hence, it is a practical method for estimating urban plant water\n\
    requirements. Replacement satellites for Terra and Aqua are planned; hence, imagery\
    \ is scheduled\nto be available in the future. ET is closely related to landscape\
    \ “greenness,” as estimated by satellite\nvegetation indices, which integrate\
    \ leaf area index, plant chlorophyll content, and fractional cover\ninto a single\
    \ predictive variable. Hence, it is not necessary to digitize separate landscape\
    \ units to\nestimate ET to estimate irrigation requirements. As long as the target\
    \ area is large enough to sample\nwith MODIS imagery (each pixel is 6.25 ha),\
    \ it should provide reliable estimates of landscape water\nrequirements. This\
    \ ﬁnding is in line with those of Johnson and Belitz [51] that employed Landsat\
    \ to\nestimate urban irrigation rates. They stated that the monthly irrigation\
    \ rate for fully irrigated urban\nsites in large sizes could be calculated using\
    \ NDVI, weather data, and scaling functions. Additionally,\nLiu et al. [52] employed\
    \ Landsat 5 data to estimate actual ET in the Oklahoma County. Their ﬁndings\n\
    approved the accuracy of remote-sensing-based ET measurements validated by ﬂux\
    \ towers and SWB.\nAcknowledgments: This study was funded by the SA Water Corporation\

    \ population and rising living standards are increasing the\ndemand for agricultural\
    \ products. Under higher pressure over natural resources, environmental\nconcerns\
    \ are increasing as well, challenging current water use decision-making processes\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. Higher agricultural productivity means water should\
    \ be applied more eﬃciently, which\nrequires instant information on weather, soil,\
    \ and plant conditions throughout the growing season.\nAn information-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling application tightened to the spatiotemporal variability of\nthe ﬁelds\
    \ is critical for enhancing the current irrigation system and making better irrigation\
    \ scheduling\ndecisions. The aim of this study is to review current irrigation\
    \ scheduling methodologies based on\ntwo case studies (woody and ﬁeld crops) located\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain. We realize\nthat optimal irrigation programming\
    \ requires consistent investment in equipment, expenditure on\noperation and maintenance,\
    \ and qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services. These technological\napproaches\
    \ will be worthwhile in farms with low water availability, high proﬁtability,\
    \ and signiﬁcant\ntechnical-economic capacity.\nKeywords: water proﬁtability;\
    \ water scarcity; sensors; big data; information and communication\ntechnologies;\
    \ irrigation scheduling\n1. Introduction\nA growing international population and\
    \ rising living standards are increasing the demand for\nagricultural products.\
    \ At the same time, globalization, markets liberalization, growing pressure on\n\
    natural resources, and environmental concerns are heightening the need for improved\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nIn the case of irrigated agriculture, meeting\
    \ this requirement involves a paradigm shift. Maximizing\nnet proﬁts will demand\
    \ a more economic approach than simply maximizing crop yields. This is\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ complex and challenging, requiring that water be applied in a wiser, more precise,\
    \ and\naccurate fashion because the margin for error narrows [3].\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785; doi:10.3390/w12030785\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n2 of 26\nFrom an engineering standpoint, achieving the above depends on\
    \ having more information, using\nenhanced irrigation systems and making better\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. Instant information is\nrequired for a thorough\
    \ understanding of weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing\n\
    season. Enhanced irrigation systems are needed for a uniform application of water\
    \ depths tailored to\nthe spatiotemporal variability of the ﬁelds. Better decisions\
    \ are necessary to convert these capacities\ninto proﬁts.\nThe scientiﬁc community\
    \ and industry work to meet these needs, taking advantage of geolocated\nand internet-enabled\
    \ devices. As a result, a wide range of technologies has been developed. Multiple\n\
    sensors for weather, soil and plant measurements can supply data continuously\
    \ and automatically in\nﬁxed points located within the ﬁeld. Weather conditions,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature, plant sap ﬂow,\ntrunk diameter, and leaf turgor\
    \ pressure are some of the variables monitored by these sensors [4,5].\nData can\
    \ also be obtained for the whole ﬁeld area. Remote and proximal sensing based\
    \ on radar\nand spectral sensors onboard satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ tractors and even centre-pivots and\nlinear-moving irrigation systems allow\
    \ high spatial and/or temporal resolution monitoring of soil\nmoisture and plant\
    \ water and nutrient status. Proximal electromagnetic induction sensors can also\
    \ be\nused for mapping soil properties along with soil sampling and testing [6–8].\n\
    High quality equipment for water application has also been developed. If adequately\
    \ selected\nand dimensioned modern irrigation systems can provide excellent performance\
    \ under a wide range of\nenvironmental conditions. Furthermore, variable rate\
    \ technology enables the application of site-speciﬁc\nwater depths according to\
    \ the spatial variability of the soil and plant conditions throughout the ﬁeld\
    \ [8].\nDealing with all these data and irrigation system capabilities involves\
    \ great analytical complexity.\nAutomated irrigation controllers have been designed\
    \ for this purpose. These controllers include\na module that computes an optimized\
    \ irrigation scheduling (and a prescription map in the case\nof variable rate\
    \ systems) according to a predeﬁned irrigation strategy and goal. The optimization\n\
    process is based on sensor data or/and output data from simulation models. Given\
    \ the complexity of\nthe soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and the uncertainty of\
    \ the available data, artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques are used to search for\
    \ the optimal solution. These techniques are also applied in other\nrelated processes,\
    \ such as model calibration and weather and water demand forecasting [4,8,9].\n\
    Despite the sophistication of this cutting-edge hardware and software, their prices\
    \ have become\naﬀordable for commercial use. Recent advances in sensors and information\
    \ and communication\ntechnologies have slashed the cost of generating, transmitting,\
    \ storing and processing large amounts\nof data. Consequently, the implementation\
    \ of these technologies in commercial farms is considered\nfeasible, in practice,\
    \ for improving their economic and environmental footprint. Likewise, its use\n\
    could improve the adaptation to climate change and to changing water demand and\
    \ supply patterns,\nenhancing food security [10–13].\nAs a consequence, these\
    \ technologies for irrigation and agriculture are generally being considered\n\
    by governments and international organizations as promising tools to achieve a\
    \ sustainable\nintensiﬁcation of agricultural production [14–16]. However, some\
    \ studies carried out in industrialized\ncountries conclude that their adoption\
    \ is not widespread, and, on average, their economic proﬁtability\nis low [17,18].\n\
    Farmers readily adopt technologies, such as auto-steer machinery and irrigation\
    \ pivots, which\nrequire limited new training and skills. However, adoption of\
    \ information-intensive technologies,\nsuch as soil or plant moisture sensors\
    \ and related software, is often limited. These technologies\nrequire further\
    \ investments in learning and/or hiring external services for data analysis. Changes\
    \ in\nmanagement practices are also often needed to accommodate data-driven decisions.\
    \ Such requirements\nmay even aﬀect the proﬁle of farmers, shifting from that\
    \ of a land manager, who grows crops according\nto his/her practical experience,\
    \ to farm technician, whose work should also be based on technical\nknowledge\
    \ [18–20].\nFarmers can adopt very diﬀerent information technology levels to ﬁne-tune\
    \ their management\npractices. Each level encompasses the use of diﬀerent layers\
    \ of information. Assessing the value\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n3 of 26\ngiven by\
    \ each information layer is essential for selecting the most suitable technological\
    \ level for each\nfarm [5,19,21].\nThe value of information is the increase in\
    \ the expected value of the outcome arising from the\nintroduction of an additional\
    \ layer of information in the decision process [22]. It depends on the\nquality\
    \ of the data (e.g., precision, trueness and timing), its total cost (e.g., investment,\
    \ operation\nand maintenance) and the conditions of the farm (e.g., environmental,\
    \ agronomic, socio-economic,\nand technical). Therefore, a particular technology\
    \ can provide diﬀerent economic and environmental\nresults depending on the region\
    \ and farm where it is used [5,18,21].\nSelecting and managing the most suitable\
    \ technological level requires technical knowledge and\nskills, as well as unbiased\
    \ information about the performance of the available technologies. Poor\ninformation\
    \ and/or low knowledge and skills mean decisions are made in a context of uncertainty,\n\
    which in turn, means cultural factors and cognitive biases may lead to the adoption\
    \ of sub-optimal\nsolutions or simply to no decisions being made. Thus, the early\
    \ adopters of new technologies are usually\nyounger farmers, with higher education\
    \ levels and larger farms in terms of economic size [17–19,23,24].\nFarms located\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries of the EU are usually smallholdings managed\n\
    by aged farmers with a low level of technical education. These features hamper\
    \ the uptake of new\ntechnologies [24]. An example of this situation is Spain,\
    \ where 59% of the farmers are older than\n55 years and only 18% have agricultural\
    \ technical training for the implementation of information and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies (ICTs) on their farms. The mean economic farm size is 37,284 €\
    \ in terms\nof standard output, which is lower than two thirds of the EU15 average\
    \ (member states of the EU on\n30 April 2004), although the 1% largest farms (≥0.5\
    \ M€) accounts for 32% of the national standard\noutput [25].\nThe Government\
    \ is tackling this problem by promoting and subsidizing the modernization of\n\
    irrigation infrastructures. As a result, water transport and distribution facilities,\
    \ as well as on-farm\nirrigation systems have been modernized across 1.5 Mha since\
    \ the beginning of this century [26].\nHowever, a number of studies have suggested\
    \ that irrigation management should be enhanced in\norder to capture the full\
    \ economic and environmental value that modern infrastructure can potentially\n\
    provide [27–31].\nMuch research has been speciﬁcally conducted to bridge this\
    \ gap [32–36]. Nevertheless, there are\nvery few analyses focused on identifying\
    \ the farm conditions that make the techniques developed\nin these studies proﬁtable.\
    \ Such analyses, along with a strengthening of extension services, training\n\
    programs, and regional trials among other measures, would enhance farmers’ capabilities\
    \ to select and\nuse technologies that help them to optimize the management of\
    \ their irrigation infrastructures [18,21,24].\nIt is clear from the above overview\
    \ that carrying out an optimal irrigation scheduling is essential\nfor improving\
    \ water and energy use in irrigated agriculture. Accordingly, methodologies focused\
    \ on\nthis issue and advances in new technologies and equipment to be implemented\
    \ in this sector have been\ndeveloped. However, in the majority of farms, these\
    \ advances have not properly got oﬀ the ground due\nto the low technical training\
    \ of farmers and the reduced proﬁtability of agricultural products, making\nthe\
    \ investment of new technologies unaﬀordable. Hence, the aim of this study is\
    \ to review the main\nfactors inﬂuencing irrigation scheduling and document the\
    \ impact of ICTs on these factors to identify\nthe conditions that drive the return\
    \ on investment of various irrigation scheduling methodologies.\nThis review is\
    \ supported by the analysis of several case studies located in semi-arid areas\
    \ of Southeast\nSpain, a country with a 30% of irrigated cropland [37] and most\
    \ of this area being under Mediterranean\nnatural conditions. The review starts\
    \ by describing the main factors that should be considered for\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Then, several case studies methodologies focused on optimal irrigation\n\
    scheduling applied in both woody and ﬁeld crops under semi-arid conditions are\
    \ presented. In the\nﬁnal section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of\
    \ these irrigation scheduling methodologies,\nbased on the case studies evaluated.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n4 of 26\n2. Factors that Aﬀect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated,\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 1. Diﬀerent combinations of these factors enable optimal\
    \ irrigation schedules to be achieved\ndepending on the technological level of\
    \ the farms (low, intermediate, or high) as regards the technological\nelements\
    \ used, as described below.\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n4  of  25 \n \n2. Factors that Affect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling \n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated, as shown in \n\
    Fig.1.  Different  combinations  of  these  factors  enable  optimal  irrigation \
    \ schedules  to  be  achieved \ndepending  on  the  technological  level  of \
    \ the  farms  (low,  intermediate,  or  high)  as  regards  the \ntechnological elements used, as described below. \n\
     \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors. \n \nCrop \n\
    The crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to satisfy the fraction \n\
    of crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisfied with rainwater during the crop season. WR \n\
    are equivalent to the amount of water evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the \n\
    agro‐climatic variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coefficient, Kc [38]. It depends \n\
    on  the  crop  characteristics,  taking  into  account  crop  height,  the  crop‐soil \
    \ surface  resistance,  and \nalbedo of the crop soil surface [39].   \nRecommended Kc values for different crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there \n\
    are  no  available  Kc  values  for  certain  crops,  or  the  recommended  values \
    \ are  suited  to  different \nenvironmental  conditions  [40].  Thus,  different \
    \ works  have  focused  on  setting  specific  Kc  values \nconsidering on‐site environmental conditions by relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44]. \n\
    Alternatively, other authors have used crop simulation models to determine specific Kc values for \n\
    non‐stressed and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]). \
    \  \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors.\n• Crop\nThe\
    \ crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to\
    \ satisfy the fraction\nof crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisﬁed\
    \ with rainwater during the crop season. WR are\nequivalent to the amount of water\
    \ evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the\nagro-climatic\
    \ variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coeﬃcient, Kc [38].\
    \ It depends\non the crop characteristics, taking into account crop height, the\
    \ crop-soil surface resistance, and albedo\nof the crop soil surface [39].\nRecommended\
    \ Kc values for diﬀerent crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there\n\
    are no available Kc values for certain crops, or the recommended values are suited\
    \ to diﬀerent\nenvironmental conditions [40]. Thus, diﬀerent works have focused\
    \ on setting speciﬁc Kc values\nconsidering on-site environmental conditions by\
    \ relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44].\nAlternatively, other authors\
    \ have used crop simulation models to determine speciﬁc Kc values for\nnon-stressed\
    \ and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]).\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 785\n5 of 26\nThe use of speciﬁc crop coeﬃcients can improve irrigation\
    \ programming, generating both higher\nyields and water use eﬃciency [46].\n•\
    \ Weather data\nLocal weather determines crop irrigation requirements (IR) and\
    \ consequently irrigation programming.\nRainfall and air temperature are the basic\
    \ data required to calculate IR using values of eﬀective\nprecipitation (Pe) and\
    \ ETo estimated by low-parameter procedures like the Hargreaves equation [47].\n\
    However, many weather stations can now also record data such as humidity, solar\
    \ radiation and wind\nspeed, among others (e.g., [48]). When this information\
    \ is available, physically based ETo calculation\nmethods, such as the Penman-Monteith\
    \ model [38], can be used to provide accurate estimations of\nETo [49,50]. Thus,\
    \ in many cases, there is either a lack of data or their quality is not guaranteed,\n\
    or the weather station is located too far from the area studied [51,52]. This\
    \ leads to non-accurate ETo\nestimations [53] which means uncertainties in the\
    \ irrigation programming.\n• Soil data\nSoil characteristics such as soil condition,\
    \ slope, texture, structure, depth, organic matter content,\nbulk density, salinity,\
    \ acidity drainage, fertility and chemical parameters aﬀect soil water distribution\n\
    and root water absorption [54]. Standard numerical soil properties at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 250 m and at\na global scale can be obtained from systems such\
    \ as SoilGridsTM [55]. However, soil measurements are\npoint measurements that\
    \ show spatiotemporal variability in the same ﬁeld during the irrigation season.\n\
    Accordingly, these authors evaluated the time and spatial variability of soil\
    \ hydraulic characteristics\nduring the cropping season, showing that soil variations\
    \ during the season are important and lead to\ninaccurate irrigation programming.\
    \ Irrigation events also aﬀect soil hydraulic characteristics, which\nhighlights\
    \ the importance of carrying out soil hydraulic parameter analysis during the\
    \ cropping season\nto improve irrigation programming [56].\nIn sandy soils, with\
    \ a low water retention capacity, spatiotemporal hydraulic characterization is\n\
    crucial [57,58]. As an example of watering diﬃculties in sandy soils, in a two-season\
    \ study of irrigated\npotato cultivated in a sandy soil in USA, soil water storage\
    \ and deep drainage at several zones across\nthe farm were evaluated [57], detecting\
    \ a signiﬁcant spatiotemporal variability in soil water storage\nand temporal\
    \ diﬀerences on deep drainage. To reduce deep drainage, soil water movement models\n\
    like Hydrus 2-D were used to set the optimum duration of irrigation pulses in\
    \ strawberries cultivated\nin extremely sandy soils in Spain, for each crop development\
    \ stage [58].\n• Irrigation scheduling criteria\nIrrigation scheduling consists\
    \ of setting the timing and the amount of water to be applied to the\ncrop [59]\
    \ to either maximize the production or to maximize the beneﬁt [59]. Over recent\
    \ decades, these\ngoals have also been linked to eﬃciency criteria in the use\
    \ of both water and energy resources [60].\nTo achieve them, several “irrigation\
    \ criteria” have been used to establish the irrigation scheduling:\n(1) A farmer’s\
    \ perception/ experience of crop irrigation needs, which usually results in less-than-optimal\n\
    irrigation scheduling (lack of water during some crop stages and over-irrigation\
    \ in others) and hence,\nlower production and proﬁts [61]; (2) Rational estimation\
    \ of daily crop irrigation requirements using\nhistorical climate data that are\
    \ daily updated during the irrigation season [62]; (3) Rational estimation\nof\
    \ daily crop irrigation requirements based on both climate information and on\
    \ daily soil water\nbalance [63,64]; (4) Estimation of daily irrigation needs\
    \ using soil water data collected from soil\nmoisture sensors [65,66]; (5) Irrigation\
    \ needs estimated from plant water status monitoring using sap\nﬂow sensors [5,67],\
    \ trunk growth rate sensors [68], leaf water potential [69], or leaf turgor pressure\n\
    sensors [70], among others.\nThe above criteria deﬁne the daily irrigation program\
    \ once the irrigation strategy is established.\nSeveral factors condition the\
    \ irrigation strategy: the water allocation for the whole season (from full\n\
    irrigation to diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation [71]); the type of irrigation\
    \ system and its hydraulic\ncharacteristics [62,63]; or water availability at\
    \ ﬁeld scale, according to the management of the irrigation\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n\
    6 of 26\ndistrict (on demand irrigation in which farmers can irrigate 24 h a day\
    \ or by irrigation turns [72,73]),\nto name a few.\n• Water source, water rights,\
    \ and water markets\nWater sources for irrigation include groundwater from wells,\
    \ surface water, rain harvesting and\ntreated water from municipal areas [74].\
    \ The kind and quality of water source aﬀects water availability\nat ﬁeld scale.\
    \ For example, groundwater is a more reliable water source and less vulnerable\
    \ to drought\ncompared to surface water [75]. As for using rain harvesting pond\
    \ or treated water for irrigation, water\navailability will be aﬀected by climatic\
    \ variables, the pond storage capacity, and the legislation on that\nissue [76,77].\n\
    Water rights are required to legally establish the available water at ﬁeld scale.\
    \ “A water right\nis a legal entitlement authorizing water to be diverted from\
    \ a speciﬁed source and put to beneﬁcial,\nnon-wasteful use” [78]. Hence, water\
    \ rights aﬀect irrigation programming.\nTo name a few examples, in England, a\
    \ license is required to abstract water for irrigation and to\nobtain/ renew this\
    \ license, farmers must demonstrate that water is used eﬃciently [79]. In areas\
    \ of\nhigh competition for water, such as the Mediterranean basin, the water authorities\
    \ usually impose\nrestrictions on water use that do not always make the producer\
    \ aware of the eﬃcient use of irrigation\nwater, implementing precision irrigation\
    \ based on optimal irrigation schedules [80]. In Spain, water\nallocations are\
    \ usually assigned per crop, causing occasional disputes between water authorities\
    \ and\nfarmers, who demand more water [81].\nIn other areas, water rights are\
    \ characterized by elements such as priority date, whereby users\nwho ﬁrst acquired\
    \ water rights take preference in accessing water resources over other users who\n\
    obtained their rights later. Hence, during droughts periods, reductions in water\
    \ allocations aﬀect “new”\nfarmers ﬁrst [82]. Accordingly, in a study carried\
    \ out in California’s Central Valley on the eﬀects of\nwater rights on agricultural\
    \ production during drought periods, it was shown that watersheds whose\nfarmers\
    \ have more senior water rights have on average better agricultural productivity\
    \ outcomes than\nwatersheds with more junior rights [83].\nIn some semi-arid countries,\
    \ particularly during droughts, economic instruments to deal with\nwater allocations\
    \ are available. Water markets are one such instrument, enabling voluntary water\n\
    exchanges between users. Australia, and to a lesser extent, Spain and California,\
    \ are three representative\nexamples of water trade [84]. In a study on the eﬀects\
    \ of droughts on water markets in the three regions\nindicated above, the authors\
    \ highlighted that drought periods are a triggering factor for water trade\nbetween\
    \ users [84].\n• Water distribution system and irrigation system.\nOpen channel\
    \ water distribution networks usually entail higher water losses than pressurized\n\
    irrigation networks [85]. Therefore, these losses must be taken into account for\
    \ irrigation programming [86].\nConversely, pressurized irrigation networks show\
    \ higher water use eﬃciency but also increased energy\nrequirements [87]. In these\
    \ kinds of networks, the operating conditions should be considered in the\ndesign\
    \ of such networks. This ensures that hydrant service conditions are adequate\
    \ for the proper\nfunctioning of on-ﬁeld irrigation systems, applying the expected\
    \ water depth and avoiding inadequate\nirrigation schedules that lead to ineﬃcient\
    \ use of water [88].\nThe hydraulic features of the on-farm irrigation system\
    \ must also be considered to establish the\nirrigation programming. These features\
    \ depend on the type of system (surface, sprinkler, or trickle)\nand its design\
    \ (layout) and hydrant operation (sectoring) [63,89].\n• Energy source and its\
    \ management\nPressurized water distribution and application systems are generally\
    \ more eﬃcient in the use of\nwater than open channel systems. For this reason,\
    \ they have become common in recent decades [90].\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n7 of 26\n\
    However, the price to be paid for this improvement is the augmentation of energy\
    \ costs, in many\ncases leading to increases of more than 50% in the cost of irrigation\
    \ compared to previous gravity\nirrigation systems [85].\nIn recent years, numerous\
    \ studies have aimed to optimize the use of water and energy in irrigation\nsystems\
    \ at irrigation district scale considering the operation of the network (sectoring,\
    \ control of critical\npoints or electric tariﬀ selection, [91–93]). The operation\
    \ of the main hydraulic networks designed\nto reduce energy costs may limit the\
    \ available irrigation time for farmers conditioning the irrigation\nschedule\
    \ of their ﬁelds. For example, some irrigation districts (ID) in Spain have reduced\
    \ their energy\ncosts by choosing the lowest electric tariﬀ: farmers can irrigate\
    \ during the night from Monday to Friday\nand for 24 h on Saturdays, Sundays,\
    \ and bank holidays [73]. Their energy costs savings are about 25%\nfor similar\
    \ water use [94].\nHowever, optimal management of irrigation networks does not\
    \ avoid the dependence of irrigation\nagriculture on ﬂuctuations in energy prices.\
    \ Therefore, in recent years, the reduction of electricity\nproduction costs from\
    \ renewable energy sources (wind, solar photovoltaic and micro hydropower)\nis\
    \ facilitating their incorporation into the irrigation sector [64,95,96]. Since\
    \ the generation of energy\ndepends on suitable weather conditions (suﬃcient wind\
    \ or solar radiation for pumping), irrigation\nmust be scheduled around the availability\
    \ of renewably sourced energy [64].\n• Management and control technologies\nThe\
    \ technological development of the last decade has had enormous repercussions\
    \ in irrigation\nmanagement and control. Today’s commercial sensors and irrigation\
    \ controllers, ICs, provide a good\nvalue for money in an aﬀordable price range\
    \ for most farmers. In addition, the constant improvement\nof information and\
    \ communication technologies, ICTs, facilitates the interaction between sensors,\
    \ IC,\nand users through web platforms and applications for mobile devices [62,97].\n\
    ICs open and close pipes remotely enabling or disabling the electro-valves associated\
    \ with each\nirrigation sector according to the irrigation times programmed (input\
    \ data). These are key devices to\nmake irrigation easier for farmers as they\
    \ can start and ﬁnish irrigation at any time, no matter day or\nnight, during\
    \ the daily period available for irrigation with daily, weekly or monthly frequency.\
    \ Input\ndata are introduced by the user, or a baseline irrigation schedule is\
    \ updated periodically according to\nreal time information on the variables that\
    \ aﬀect irrigation (e.g., soil moisture, pressure at the pumping\nstation, irradiance)\
    \ measured by sensors [64]. The IC’s operational rules may be simple (exceedance\
    \ of\nthreshold values) or optimal irrigation schedules based on soil-plant-water\
    \ models and optimization\nprocedures [34,98–101]. Thus, the IC installed on a\
    \ farm conditions the irrigation programming.\nThere currently exists a wide range\
    \ of commercial sensors to monitor and control crop, soil,\nclimatic variables\
    \ and the irrigation network. Their records are stored in data loggers that, in\
    \ most\ncases, can be remotely accessed by ICs and/or web platforms/app for mobile\
    \ terminals.\nWeb platforms funded by either public institutions or private associations\
    \ to support irrigation\nprogramming have become a common tool among technical\
    \ staﬀ and farmers, many of them accessible\nby apps for smartphones/tablets,\
    \ thanks to the exponential development of ICTs in recent years [102].\nIrrigation\
    \ apps allow farmers to visualize the key variables of each event, and even act\
    \ on the system\nfrom almost anywhere, as telecommunication coverage has improved\
    \ in rural areas. Web platforms\nand apps are accessible for both individual farmers\
    \ and irrigators’ associations, expanding the number\nof potential users compared\
    \ to the supervisory control and acquisition data systems, SCADA, which\nmonitored\
    \ and controlled systems from a ﬁxed location and were restricted to associations\
    \ and large\nfarms, but which have been a key factor in the digitization of irrigated\
    \ agriculture [103].\nThe spatiotemporal variability of applied water depth should\
    \ be considered to improve irrigation\nscheduling. Remote sensing techniques based\
    \ on the use of satellite images and unmanned aerial\nvehicles, or geostatistical\
    \ methods that require either detailed soil study and dense sampling or\nestimation\
    \ of soil moisture content from alternative low-cost techniques (e.g., electromagnetic\
    \ induction\nexploration techniques) are complementary tools for monitoring the\
    \ real application of irrigation water.\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n8 of 26\nThis permits\
    \ the visualization of the spatial variability of soil water content, splitting\
    \ the cropped area\ninto irrigation sectors with ad hoc irrigation programs [30,104,105].\n\
    • Data analysis and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nThe modernization of many irrigation\
    \ networks involved not only the change of hydraulic\ninfrastructures, but also\
    \ the installation of telemetry devices, initially aimed at automating billing,\n\
    recording consumption at user level at certain intervals (big data collection)\
    \ [103].\nThe robustness of the current telemetry systems, most of which are based\
    \ on wireless communication,\nfacilitates database feeding with large amounts\
    \ of data. It is increasingly common today for farmers’\nassociations to record\
    \ detailed information on their users’ water consumption (hourly consumption)\n\
    throughout the irrigation campaign. These massive data sets (weather, crop, soil,\
    \ irrigation network\noperation and even markets data) require storage space (e.g.,\
    \ cloud storage) to be further processed by\nAI techniques. There are a wide variety\
    \ of AI techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, fuzzy logic,\nor decision\
    \ trees, that can be applied separately or combined to improve the accuracy of\
    \ irrigation\nprogramming [98,102].\nConsumption data linked to water use features\
    \ at hydrant level (soil, critical periods of crop\ndevelopment, water allocation,\
    \ etc.), agroclimatic information provided by public and/or private\nweb platforms\
    \ and, when available, the knowledge of farmer’s behaviour (related, for example,\n\
    to their perception of weather conditions, national holidays and vacation periods)\
    \ allow accurate\npredictions of irrigation scheduling at farmer scale (when,\
    \ how much and for how long he/she\nirrigates) [106–108]. Accurate individual\
    \ irrigation schedules aggregated at irrigation district level\nprovide valuable\
    \ information for managers to optimize the use of water and energy.\n• Economy\
    \ and farmer’s behaviour\nThe costs of current irrigation scheduling systems (e.g.,\
    \ ICs, sensors, apps, web platforms,\netc.) are generally falling. However, for\
    \ moderate- to low-proﬁt crops, this technology may still be\ncost-prohibitive\
    \ if it doesn’t signiﬁcantly increase farmer income [61]. However, the production\
    \ of\nhigh value crops in areas with low water availability, such as greenhouse\
    \ crops in Southeast Spain, is\nhighly technological, particularly in irrigation\
    \ scheduling [109].\nMarket demands have a great inﬂuence on farmers, as the economic\
    \ factor is the main driver for\nimproving their irrigation management (including\
    \ technology). Markets, especially for fresh products,\ndemand products be obtained\
    \ sustainably. Water plays a crucial role in the concept of sustainability\napplied\
    \ to irrigated agricultural production. For growers, it is increasingly important\
    \ that their\nproducts are identiﬁed as sustainable through the corresponding\
    \ indicators and certiﬁcations, in order\nto maintain or even increase their market\
    \ price. For example, the use of the Water Footprint indicator\n(volume of water\
    \ used throughout the growing season divided by the production obtained) [110],\
    \ which\ncan be estimated by applying diﬀerent methodologies (waterfootprint.org,\
    \ ISO14046 standard [80,111]),\nencourages the use of optimal irrigation scheduling\
    \ systems to make eﬃcient use of water while\nmaintaining production levels.\n\
    3. Actual Cases of Application of Optimal Irrigation Programming\n3.1. Automatic\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling in Woody Crops\nThis study case focuses on the results\
    \ obtained in the implementation of an automated irrigation\nprotocol based on\
    \ water uptake estimated from soil water content data, measured by multi-capacitance\n\
    probes, on two early-maturing Prunus persica L. orchards growing in semi-arid\
    \ conditions in Southeast\nSpain. This area is subject to Mediterranean climate\
    \ where water resources are dwindling, and\nagriculture sector accounts for 80%\
    \ of all water withdrawals.\nUnder this scenario, most water\nuser associations\
    \ must deal with permanent water deﬁcits through the irrigation season. The water\n\
    application for high crop yield and quality must be carried out in such a way\
    \ as to be eﬃcient in relieving\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n9 of 26\nstress in the most\
    \ sensitive phenological phases by applying deﬁcit irrigation (DI) strategies\
    \ [112].\nDI requires the use of sensors for real time monitoring of the soil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ system [113].\nA controlled deﬁcit irrigated peach tree experiment and a full-irrigated\
    \ nectarine tree experiments\nare described in the following subsections. Both\
    \ studies aim to compare irrigation scheduling based on\nsoil water sensors with\
    \ an ETc-based treatment.\n3.1.1. Experimental Site and Plant Material\nThe experiments\
    \ were carried out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station in Santomera,\n\
    Murcia, Spain (38◦06′31” N, 1◦02′14” W, 110 m altitude) in two adjacent early-maturing\
    \ Prunus persica\n(L.) Batsch tree orchards: peach trees (cv. Flordastar) were\
    \ spaced 5 × 5 m, and nectarine trees\n(cv. Flariba) 6.5 m × 3.5 m, both trained\
    \ to an open-centre canopy. The soil in the 0–0.5 m layer was\nstony, highly calcareous\
    \ (45% calcium carbonate), with a clay loam texture (clay fraction: 41% Illite,\n\
    17% Smectite, and 30% Paligorskita). The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3.\
    \ The soil water content\nat ﬁeld capacity and wilting permanent point were 0.29\
    \ and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively.\nThe average electrical conductivity (EC25ºC)\
    \ of the irrigation water was close to 1.3 dS m−1.\nThe irrigation system (97%\
    \ uniformity coeﬃcient) consisted of a single drip line per tree row with\npressure-compensated\
    \ emitters (8 × 2 Lh−1 and 4 × 4 Lh−1 per tree for peach and nectarine trees,\n\
    respectively) evenly distributed along the lateral.\nHarvesting took place in\
    \ the ﬁrst week of May. Other standard cultural practices such as winter\npruning\
    \ (during dormancy), thinning (March) and pest control were performed by experiment\
    \ station\npersonnel. More details on plant phenology can be found in [114].\n\
    Two treatments were considered: a control (conventional 100% ETc as ET0 × Kc computations,\
    \ [37],\nKc from [115] and an automated irrigation scheduling based on soil water\
    \ content values. These were\ndistributed in a completely randomized design with\
    \ four repetitions per irrigation treatment, each\nconsisting of one row of 13\
    \ trees (peach) and six trees (nectarine).\n3.1.2. Measurements\nAgrometeorological\
    \ data, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global\nradiation,\
    \ precipitation, and ET0 (FAO56-Penman Monteith, [37]) were recorded by an automated\n\
    weather station located at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station and integrated\
    \ in a web server\n(http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.html). The\
    \ climate conditions registered were those\ntypical of Mediterranean areas, characterized\
    \ by high seasonality summarized as hot and dry summers\nand cool and wet winters\
    \ with high evaporative demand (ET0 ten-year average values of 1320 mm)\nand low\
    \ rainfall, normally below 250 mm.\nThe volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was\
    \ monitored with multi-depth capacitance FDR\n(Frequency Domain Reﬂectometry)\
    \ probes (EnviroSCAN) assembled with a PCB interface SDI-12.\nFour PVC access\
    \ tubes were installed 0.1 m to the emitter located close to the tree trunk in\
    \ four\nrepresentative trees, one of each replication. Each capacitance probe\
    \ had sensors ﬁtted to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5\nand 0.7 (nectarine), 0.8 (peach) m depth,\
    \ and were connected to a radio transmission unit, which read\nevery 5 min and\
    \ recorded the average value every 15 min. The sensors were previously normalized\
    \ on\nair and irrigation water and, subsequently, converted to VSWC using Sentek’s\
    \ default calibration for a\nclay-loam soil. Average VSWC values in the 0–0.5\
    \ m soil proﬁle were calculated, since they correspond\nto the maximum root density\
    \ area [116]. Volumetric counters were installed for each treatment and\ndrip\
    \ gauges were placed below the emitter, in the same place location as the capacitance\
    \ probe, to\nmonitor real time irrigation amount.\nProbes were connected to a\
    \ radio transmission unit network sending data to a gateway connected\nvia TCP/IP\
    \ to an AddVantage web server. In this server, a feedback condition was in charge\
    \ of triggering\nand closing electrovalves depending on mean ﬁeld values. Irrigation\
    \ alarms were also deﬁned to\nprevent water losses, and electrovalve failures.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n10 of 26\nTree water status was evaluated weekly from March\
    \ to October in one mature leaf per tree and\nreplications (n = 4), by measuring\
    \ midday stem water potential (Ψstem, MPa) using a pressure chamber\n(Soil Moisture\
    \ Equip. Corp. Model 3000). Net CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance\
    \ were\nmeasured along the season with a portable gas exchange system (LI-COR,\
    \ LI-6400) for validating\nirrigation practices.\n3.1.3. Automated Irrigation\
    \ Criteria\nThe automated irrigation treatment was based on VSWC values in the\
    \ 0–0.5 m depth, thus soil\nsensors become practical biosensors of the root water\
    \ uptake. One deeper sensor would monitor the\nwetting front beyond the roots.\
    \ Integration of average VSWC values and the threshold values acted on\nelectro-valves\
    \ by the telemetry system.\nAs described by [117,118] in the peach orchard, the\
    \ ﬁrst approach consisted of monitoring the\nVSWC pattern in the peach orchard\
    \ throughout the season using conventional ETc values for irrigation.\nThis resulted\
    \ in over- and under-irrigation, indicating that better scheduling was needed.\
    \ In the second\napproach, irrigation was automatically managed by checking the\
    \ VSWC at 22:00 h, and irrigation only\nstarted if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer\
    \ at this time was below 95% of ﬁeld capacity (FC) and stopped\nwhen the sensor\
    \ at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded at 22:00 h.\
    \ This\nprocedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive decrease\
    \ in VSWC at 0.8 m,\nwith increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the\
    \ target.\nIn the third approach, real-time irrigation was managed according to\
    \ diﬀerent VSWC threshold\nvalues, as proposed by [119,120], based on the diﬀerent\
    \ sensitivities to water stress depending on the\nphenological stage of the tree\
    \ [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at\n95%\
    \ FC and ended at FC, and during post-harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and\
    \ ended at 95% FC.\nSubsequently, the post-harvest period was divided into two:\
    \ early (mid-May to mid-July, with 90 and\n95% FC, for start and end of irrigation,\
    \ respectively) and late (from mid-July onwards, with 85 and 90%\nFC, respectively).\n\
    The fourth approach consisted of converting previous trigger/stopping criteria\
    \ into the universal\nmanagement allowed depletion (MAD) fraction, derived from\
    \ the original water availability\nconcept [122].\nFor stone fruit tress under\
    \ drip irrigation, the values α = 0.1 MAD during the\ncritical period (fruit growth\
    \ and early postharvest) and α = 0.3 MAD during late-postharvest were\napplied\
    \ (Figure 2). This approach was studied in a nectarine orchard (with a similar\
    \ phenology\ncalendar as in peach) with the aim of fulﬁlling plant water requirements\
    \ [123].\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n10  of  25 \nirrigation only started if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer at this time was below 95% of field capacity \n\
    (FC) and stopped when the sensor at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded \n\

    VSWC at 0.8 m, with increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the target. \
    \  \nIn the third approach, real‐time irrigation was managed according to different VSWC threshold \n\
    values, as proposed by [119,120], based on the different sensitivities to water stress depending on the \n\
    phenological stage of the tree [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at \n\
    95% FC and ended at FC, and during post‐harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and ended at 95% \n\
    FC. Subsequently, the post‐harvest period was divided into two: early (mid‐May to mid‐July, with 90 \n\
    and 95% FC, for start and end of irrigation, respectively) and late (from mid‐July onwards, with 85 \n\
    and 90% FC, respectively). \nThe  fourth  approach  consisted  of  converting \

    \ such as those recorded\nduring spring (46.6 mm in March and 87 mm early September)\
    \ (Figure 2), induced signiﬁcant increases\nin VSWC values at 0.7 m depth, possibly\
    \ causing some water losses through the plant root inﬂuence.\nHowever, VSWC at\
    \ a deeper soil proﬁle remained constant most of the time. Therefore, drainage\
    \ can\nbe assumed to be negligible under these conditions.\nVSWC-based treatment\
    \ induced moderate water deﬁcits in peach trees as indicated the lower Ψstem\n\
    values (up to −1.5 MPa) compared with the control trees (around −0.8 MPa) during\
    \ the postharvest\nperiod [117,120]. Ψstem values for nectarine trees remained\
    \ around −1 MPa in both treatments [123].\nAs many authors have proposed for deciduous\
    \ fruit trees [117,121,124–126], the post-harvest\nperiod is suitable for applying\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation strategies because this stage is less sensitive\
    \ to\nsoil water deﬁcits than during fruiting. Interestingly, in the two studied\
    \ early-maturing Prunus cultivars,\npost-harvest is the longest period of the\
    \ growing season, accounting for 80% of the water requirements\nneeded for the\
    \ entire irrigation season [120], and is important because it is when carbohydrate\
    \ reserves\nare accumulated and the ﬂoral diﬀerentiation process occurs [127].\
    \ Accordingly, water deﬁcits should\nbe managed carefully in order to avoid severe\
    \ plant water deﬁcits that would reduce bloom and fruit\nload in the next season’s\
    \ harvest [117,120,121,125,126,128].\nOther studies have indicated that monitoring\
    \ the VSWC with capacitive FDR probes improved overall\nirrigation, providing\
    \ good calibration, installation, and data acquisition and interpretation [113,114,120,129].\n\
    Ref. [130] suggested pulsed irrigations based on MAD (maintained between 50 and\
    \ 15%) for\nautomated irrigation of watermelons; when the given set point was\
    \ detected, a 30 min irrigation cycle\nwas initiated followed by a 1h wait period.\
    \ Furthermore, [131] compared several irrigation scheduling\nalgorithms including,\
    \ among others, soil-based ones using granular matrix sensors and soil water\n\
    balance. They concluded that the latter seemed to be economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate for\nautomatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees.\n\
    Our ﬁndings indicated that irrigation scheduling based on precise VSWC threshold\
    \ values is a\nuseful tool for monitoring the soil water status, allowing automatic\
    \ and eﬃcient irrigation management.\nWhen probes are located at the maximum root\
    \ exploration volume and the thresholds were precisely\ndeﬁned, an adequate plant\
    \ water status was favoured, resulting in slight water deﬁcits limiting only\n\
    vegetative growth while maintaining high yields with prime quality. A peach yield\
    \ of 18.2 t ha−1\nwas obtained in the soil-based treatment, which was non-signiﬁcantly\
    \ diﬀerent in comparison with\n20.1 t ha−1 in the traditional scheduled trees,\
    \ allowing a 33% of water saving against an irrigation\napplication of 7000–7300\
    \ m3 ha−1) [117,120].\nIn addition, the real-time SWC values led to the automation\
    \ of irrigation without inducing water\nstress in nectarine trees, deriving irrigation\
    \ factors that in a practical, easy and precise manner, allowed\nprecision irrigationto\
    \ be managed [123]. Annual water requirements for early-maturing nectarine trees,\n\
    in the agro-climatic area of Region de Murcia (Southeast Spain), ﬁgured ≈ 6600\
    \ m3 ha−1, with irrigation\nfrequency varying from <1 to 7 days a week depending\
    \ on the phenological period. However, in this\nexperiment only 4500 m3 ha−1 were\
    \ applied, with around 30% of water savings as compared to control\ntrees irrigated\
    \ following traditional FAO-56 approach.\n3.2. Irrigation Scheduling in Arable\
    \ Crops\nAgriculture in Castilla-La Mancha (CLM) occupies an area of 3,773,029\
    \ ha, of which 557,851 ha\nare irrigated lands [132], mainly with sprinkler and\
    \ drip irrigation systems. The use of irrigation in\nthe area is the result of\
    \ low average annual precipitation (around 400 mm year−1) and high reference\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n12 of 26\nevapotranspiration (>1100 mm year−1), characterizing\
    \ the area as semi-arid [133]. The most common\nirrigated crops are grapes, cereals,\
    \ garlic, onion, melon, watermelon, pepper, and others such as\nsunﬂower, potato,\
    \ and alfalfa.\nApproximately 70% of the irrigable area in CLM is located close\
    \ to groundwater sources (average\nelectrical conductivity EC = 0.8 dS m−1, which\
    \ is suitable for irrigation), given that most surface\nwater resources are used\
    \ in other bordering regions. In order to avoid the overexploitation of these\n\
    aquifers, farmers are restricted in the use of water by the water authority in\
    \ the area (“Confederación\nHidrográﬁca del Júcar” in the case of the Eastern\
    \ Mancha aquifer, and “Confederación Hidrográﬁca del\nGuadiana” in the case of\
    \ the Western Mancha and Campo de Montiel aquifers). Every year, the water\nauthority\
    \ determines the amount of water that each farmer can use, depending on the progression\
    \ of\nthe piezometric levels of the aquifers. Consequently, the total area irrigated\
    \ in the region varies each\nyear, as does the crop pattern, which is conditioned\
    \ by the evolution of the harvest prices. Moreover,\nthe increasing cost of energy\
    \ required for pumping groundwater and irrigating crops using pressurized\nirrigation\
    \ systems is another factor conditioning the use of water and the proﬁtability\
    \ of the irrigated\nfarms. Groundwater in the area is free, but farmers must pay\
    \ for the energy and the amortization of\nthe irrigation systems. Thus, the average\
    \ water cost in the area is around 0.12 € m−3 [134].\nLarge areas of rainfed land\
    \ were transformed into irrigated land during the 1970s and 1980s,\nwhereby the\
    \ average size of the holdings (rainfed and irrigated) is about 33 ha, which is\
    \ an appropriate\nsize for farm proﬁtability. However, only 8% of farmers are\
    \ younger than 40 years, and many of them\ncombine agriculture with other activities,\
    \ fostering the adoption of innovative methodologies and the\nmodernization of\
    \ their exploitations [135].\nAs a way to maximize the production proﬁtability\
    \ of irrigated crops in water scare regions such\nas CLM, the Regional Centre\
    \ of Water Research (CREA) of Castilla-La Mancha University (UCLM)\nhas developed\
    \ MOPECO (economic optimization model of irrigation water) [136–138]. The model\
    \ is\nbased on FAO-33 [139] and FAO-56 [38] methodologies, and has been calibrated\
    \ for diﬀerent annual\nextensive crops in several areas of the world [137,140–145].\
    \ MOPECO is designed to provide farmers\nwith a reliable and friendly on-line\
    \ tool for the proper management of farms and crops based on water\nproductivity\
    \ (WP).\n3.2.1. Optimal Distribution of Crops and Optimized Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    MOPECO’s main goal is to maximize the gross margin (GM) of irrigable lands dedicated\
    \ to the\ncultivation of annual crops through the eﬃcient use of irrigation water\
    \ and available irrigable area.\nA set of data (Figure 3) is required for the\
    \ simulation of the optimal “Yield vs. Total Net Water” (Y vs.\nTWN), function\
    \ of each crop under the climatic conditions of a certain year being TWN = net\
    \ irrigation\n(IN) + eﬀective rainfall (Pe). To obtain Y vs. TWN, the model simulates\
    \ a range of deﬁcit irrigation\nschedules using the optimized regulated deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation (ORDI) methodology [137], considering the\neﬀects of irrigation uniformity\
    \ [146] and electrical conductivity of water on yield [141].\nThe ORDI methodology\
    \ maximizes crop yield for a certain actual evapotranspiration value\n(ETa) versus\
    \ maximum evapotranspiration rate (ETm) objective for the whole crop growing period.\n\
    The methodology determines the value of the ETa/ETm ratio for the main Ky (crop\
    \ yield response factor\nby growing stage; [139]) stages deﬁned for each crop\
    \ (i.e., establishment and vegetative development,\nﬂowering, grain development\
    \ and ripening in the case of cereals). This combination of ETa/ETm\nrates maximizes\
    \ the crop yield according to the simulations carried out, using the equation\
    \ proposed\nby [147]. Consequently, this methodology allows the Y vs. TWN function\
    \ to be generated by simulating\nseveral irrigation schedules (the model determines\
    \ 100 points of the function, but the user may vary\nthis number).\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n13 of 26\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n13  of  25 \n \nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These tangent lines define the “Pareto front” [149], \n\
    which represents the maximum GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this \n\
    line, it is impossible to benefit one variable affecting the GM without damaging another. \n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers the most likely \n\
    crop distribution to maximize the profitability of their farms (Fig. 3).   \n\
     \n \nFigure 3. MOPECO flowchart. \nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume of water to crops lower \n\
    than their full irrigation requirements for the climatic conditions of the typical meteorological year \n\
    (TMY) [144,148]. This is because maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths \n\
    lower than that required for the maximum yield (Fig. 3) due to the effect of irrigation uniformity, \n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deficit irrigation [150]. \n\
    Moreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are unknown, and it is consequently impossible \n\
    to determine the optimal irrigation schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season. \n\
    To solve this question, [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which \n\
    modifies  the  ETa/ETm  objective  of  the  different  Ky  stages  in  several \
    \ consecutive  optimizations, \naccording to the progression of the real climatic conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at \n\
    the end of each stage, and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield, \n\
    the methodology determines the deficit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the crop at each Ky \n\
    stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit by using the \n\
    TMY climatic data and the MOPECO simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the first Ky \n\
    stage, the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined \n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end of the first stage, \n\
    the ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should be similar to the target (in the first \n\
    stage there is sufficient irrigation water) or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water \n\
    availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation \n\
    water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model. Consequently, after \n\
    the first Ky stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm targets for the following Ky stages, \n\

    \ MOPECO ﬂowchart.\nIn order to decrease the number of simulations for determining\
    \ the crop irrigation requirements\nunder local climatic conditions, the typical\
    \ meteorological year (TMY) [148] was adapted by [144] for\nirrigation scheduling.\
    \ A TMY consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated\n\
    to form a complete year with daily unmodiﬁed values (maximum and minimum temperature,\
    \ ETo and\nrainfall) which show a perfect interrelationship. In order to consider\
    \ several scenarios of irrigation\nwater requirements, dry, intermediate, and\
    \ wet TMYs were considered [145].\nThe Y vs. TWN function is translated into “Yield\
    \ vs. Total Gross Water” (Y vs. TWG), where TWG\n= gross irrigation (IG) + Pe,\
    \ to include the application eﬃciency of the irrigation system. The Gross\nMargin\
    \ (GM) vs. TWG function is then calculated using crop economic data. Finally,\
    \ the model\ncalculates the optimal crop distribution and the amount of water\
    \ assigned to each crop that fulﬁls\nthe restrictions imposed by the user (selected\
    \ crops, total irrigable area, and total available volume\nof irrigation water)\
    \ for certain climatic conditions through the direct solution algorithm developed\n\
    by [136]. This algorithm calculates the reference points where the tangent lines\
    \ that connect each pair of\nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These\
    \ tangent lines deﬁne the “Pareto front” [149],\nwhich represents the maximum\
    \ GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this\nline, it\
    \ is impossible to beneﬁt one variable aﬀecting the GM without damaging another.\n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers\
    \ the most likely\ncrop distribution to maximize the proﬁtability of their farms\
    \ (Figure 3).\nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume\
    \ of water to crops lower\nthan their full irrigation requirements for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the typical meteorological year\n(TMY) [144,148]. This is because\
    \ maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths\nlower than that\
    \ required for the maximum yield (Figure 3) due to the eﬀect of irrigation uniformity,\n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation [150].\nMoreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are\
    \ unknown, and it is consequently impossible\nto determine the optimal irrigation\
    \ schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season.\nTo solve this question,\
    \ [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which\nmodiﬁes\
    \ the ETa/ETm objective of the diﬀerent Ky stages in several consecutive optimizations,\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n14 of 26\naccording to the progression of the real climatic\
    \ conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at\nthe end of each stage,\
    \ and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield,\n\
    the methodology determines the deﬁcit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the\
    \ crop at each Ky\nstage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required\
    \ to reach that level of deﬁcit by using the\nTMY climatic data and the MOPECO\
    \ simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the ﬁrst Ky\nstage, the objective\
    \ is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined\n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end\
    \ of the ﬁrst stage,\nthe ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should\
    \ be similar to the target (in the ﬁrst\nstage there is suﬃcient irrigation water)\
    \ or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water\navailability do\
    \ not allow that level of deﬁcit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation\
    \ water\napplied to the crop will likely be diﬀerent to that forecast by the model.\
    \ Consequently, after the ﬁrst\nKy stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm\
    \ targets for the following Ky stages, taking into\naccount the actual remaining\
    \ irrigation water (2nd optimization). The same methodology is followed\nat the\
    \ end of each Ky stage. During the optimizations, a certain amount of irrigation\
    \ water is saved\nfor the last stage (that determined in the 2nd optimization)\
    \ in order to avoid the total depletion of\nirrigation water during previous Ky\
    \ stage. This methodology has been successfully applied under real\nmanagement\
    \ conditions in barley and garlic, as explained below.\n3.2.2. Applications\n\
    In order to validate MOPECO and assess its applicability, the following experiments\
    \ were\nconducted in commercial farms under diﬀerent water availability scenarios\
    \ [134,151–154].\nThe time and volume of water supplied to each experiment were\
    \ determined by MOPECO and\nchecked by soil moisture sensors or gravimetric samples.\n\
    Maize\nThe eﬀect of irrigation uniformity on maize (Zea Mays L.) yield and proﬁtability\
    \ was evaluated\nin 2016 in Albacete (Spain), in two adjacent sectors equipped\
    \ with a solid set sprinkler irrigation\nsystem [153]. The ﬁeld was managed according\
    \ to FAO-56 methodology throughout the growing\nseason to maximize grain yield\
    \ without water stress (Sector S1, considering 50% adequacy) or irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ determined by an experienced producer (Sector S2). Irrigation uniformity was\
    \ evaluated\nusing catch cans in both ﬁelds and grain yield was harvested within\
    \ zones exhibiting 75% (Z1), 100%\n(Z2), and 125% (Z3) of area-averaged volume\
    \ applications throughout the year. The average coeﬃcient\nof uniformity (CU)\
    \ in both sectors (S1 and S2) was 83.5%, and the net volume of applied irrigation\n\
    water totalled 709 mm in S1 and 832 mm in S2. Irrigation Water productivity (WP)\
    \ was higher in S1\n(2.20 kg m−3) than in S2 (2.05 kg m−3), highlighting the beneﬁts\
    \ of an accurate irrigation schedule on the\neﬃcient use of water. Nevertheless,\
    \ average grain yield in sector S2 approached the maximum expected\nyield of 18.4\
    \ Mg ha−1 and exhibited no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield among zones. In contrast,\n\
    sector S1 exhibited signiﬁcant yield diﬀerences (p < 0.05) across zones with a\
    \ measured yield in Z3\nof 18.5 Mg ha−1 and a yield reduction of 1.6 Mg ha−1 and\
    \ 4.0 Mg ha−1 in Z2 and Z1, respectively.\nConsequently, the area-averaged yield\
    \ in S1 was 8% lower than in S2. This last treatment was positively\ninﬂuenced\
    \ by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop (17%), which decreased\
    \ the\neﬀect of low CU (83.5%). Because of these yield diﬀerences and the relatively\
    \ low cost of irrigation\nwater (0.07 € m−3), area averaged gross margin in S1\
    \ was 18% lower compared with S2, discouraging\nan eﬃcient use of water by the\
    \ farmer. On the other hand, the grain yields simulated by MOPECO for\neach monitoring\
    \ zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends. Simulations\
    \ with\nMOPECO over a range of CU showed that improved irrigation uniformity increased\
    \ area-averaged\nyields and gross margin when following the S1 instead of S2 strategy.\
    \ In other words, eﬃcient use of\nirrigation water through accurate irrigation\
    \ scheduling and/or the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation\ntechniques requires\
    \ advanced management and maintenance of the irrigation systems.\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n15 of 26\nPurple garlic\nA two years (2015-2016) “Morado de Las Pedroñeras”\
    \ purple garlic ﬁeld experiment was conducted\nin Albacete (Spain) [151]. The\
    \ evaluated volumes of irrigation water were: no deﬁcit “ND”; and four\nvolumes\
    \ of available irrigation water: 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”, and 70% “T70”\
    \ of the net\nirrigation requirements (In = 3400 m3 ha−1 = T100) for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the intermediate TMY).\nORDI treatments reached high yields (between\
    \ 10,055 kg ha−1 of treatment ND and 8260 kg ha−1 of\nT70), also improving the\
    \ productivity of the irrigation water (up to 7.7 kg m−3 with T70). Consequently,\n\
    the blue water footprint (irrigation water) of purple garlic decreased from 0.287\
    \ m3 kg−1 of ND\ntreatment to 0.173 m3 kg−1 of T70. The ND treatment achieved\
    \ the best combination between yield\nand bulb calibre with high commercial value\
    \ in both seasons. In 2015, the deﬁcit treatments reached a\nsimilar distribution\
    \ of calibres than that of the ND. However, the unfavourable climatic conditions\n\
    of 2016 aﬀected the distribution of calibres of ORDI treatments, shifting to calibres\
    \ with lower price.\nThus, the average proﬁtability of the ND treatment was around\
    \ 9800 € ha−1 vs. 6000 € ha−1 of T70.\nReaching the same total production of garlic\
    \ in the productive area of purple garlic in CLM by using\nthe T70 strategy instead\
    \ of ND, it would be possible to reduce the irrigation requirements by around\n\
    37% with reductions in percolation due to better use of rainfall water. Nevertheless,\
    \ the bulbs would\nbe smaller, decreasing the price of the harvests and aﬀecting\
    \ the ﬁnal proﬁtability of the farms. This\nwould be higher in wet years due to\
    \ a larger area of the farm being cultivated with lower stressed\ngarlic. In contrast,\
    \ in dry years like 2016, proﬁtability would decrease notably aﬀecting the proﬁtability\n\
    of the farms. This may diminish the interest in this methodology in a highly proﬁtable\
    \ crop such as\ngarlic, which requires high investment for its cultivation.\n\
    Barley\nThis experiment was similar to the previous one and was conducted during\
    \ 2015, 2016 and 2017\nseasons in Albacete (Spain) [154]. Five irrigation water\
    \ volumes (one with no deﬁcit “ND”, and four\nlimited volumes of available irrigation\
    \ water, corresponding to 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”,\nand 70% of IN =\
    \ 2500 m3ha−1) were evaluated. As an average, ORDI achieved higher yields for\
    \ the\nwater received (between 9040 kg ha−1 of the ND treatment and 6339 kg ha−1\
    \ of the T70), enhancing\nirrigation water productivity (from 2.75 kg m−3 of the\
    \ ND up to 3.64 kg m−3 of the T80). Accordingly,\nthe barley blue water footprint\
    \ was reduced, evolving from 0.360 m3 kg−1 of the ND to 0.275 m3 kg−1\nof the\
    \ T80. All the treatments fulﬁlled the quality requirements demanded by the malt\
    \ industry, which\nwere not aﬀected by the ORDI strategy. As expected, the average\
    \ proﬁtability of ND treatment in the\narea (average 281.84 € ha−1) was higher\
    \ than the others (average 260.63 € ha−1 for T80). Nevertheless,\nthe application\
    \ of the T80 methodology in all the barley area cultivated in the Eastern CLM\
    \ region\ninstead of ND during the three experimental years would involve a 30.1%\
    \ reduction in irrigation water\nand a 13.3% increase in water productivity. This\
    \ water saving (38.3 hm3 in three years) could be used\nto replenish the Eastern\
    \ CLM aquifer (at risk of over exploitation), reducing the pumping energy costs\n\
    and improving the ecosystems depending on the aquifer, and/or to supply water\
    \ to more proﬁtable\ncrops in the area improving the economy of the region.\n\
    Barley, Maize and Onion\nThis experiment was conducted in2014 and 2015 in Albacete\
    \ (Spain) [134]. The objective was to\ncompare the proﬁtability of a 240 ha irrigated\
    \ commercial farm considering two irrigation strategies.\nThe traditional strategy\
    \ (T) consisted of applying full irrigation (F treatments) to a distribution of\n\
    crops (barley, maize and onion), considering several volumes of irrigation water\
    \ (from 2000 up to\n8000 m3 ha−1, varying the total area dedicated to each crop\
    \ by using the direct solution algorithm\nobtained by MOPECO) and four market\
    \ price scenarios considering a water cost of 0.12 € m−3.\nDepending on the availability\
    \ of irrigation water, the MOPECO strategy (M) consisted of applying to the\n\
    same crops full irrigation or the combinations of water deficit per growing stage\
    \ determined by ORDI\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n16 of 26\nmethodology (O treatments).\
    \ The optimal global deficits were: 30% ETm for barley (ETa/ETm = 0.7), 10%\n\
    ETm for maize (ETa/ETm = 0.9), and 10% ETm for onion (ETa/ETm = 0.9). For low\
    \ availabilities of\nirrigation water (between 2000 and 5000 m3 ha−1), the M strategy\
    \ achieved a proﬁtability up to 8.2%\nhigher than T in the most favourable scenario,\
    \ but the average for all the scenarios was around 2.8%,\nwhich was much lower\
    \ than expected (8.0%) according to the simulations carried out by MOPECO\nusing\
    \ historic climatic and economic data. Despite the lower increase in proﬁtability,\
    \ in all the cases,\nthe WP of the ORDI treatments was higher (average 12.4% for\
    \ barley; 3.6% for maize; and 1.4% for\nonion). The causes of these results were\
    \ the drought conditions of the two experimental years during\nspring time that\
    \ increased the amount of water required by barley, the unfavourable climatic\
    \ conditions\nduring 2015 for onion and maize that decreased their yields and\
    \ the price progression during both\nseasons (close to unproﬁtable values for\
    \ onion in the ﬁrst year). Thus, barley, a priori, the crop which\ncould yield\
    \ a water saving (because of its low proﬁtability) required more water than forecast\
    \ and\ndecreased the availability of water for the other two crops. This work\
    \ brought to light the necessity of\nmodifying ORDI, resulting in the development\
    \ of ORDI for limited volumes of water [138]. For higher\navailabilities of irrigation\
    \ water (between 5000 and 8000 m3 ha−1), the results of F and O scenarios\nwere\
    \ similar since there was suﬃcient water for avoiding deﬁcit irrigation.\n4. Discussion\n\
    The above study cases described the response of a wide range of crops to two diﬀerent\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling approaches under semi-arid conditions: one based on real\
    \ time SWC measurements and\nthe other based on simulation models.\nThe automatic\
    \ irrigation system (AIS) eﬃciently processed and sent the user real-time ﬁeld\
    \ data\n(SWC, applied irrigation volume, and weather data). It also activated/deactivated\
    \ the electrovalves\nthat control the beginning and end of irrigation events.\
    \ To this end, the AIS eﬀectively combined the\ninformation collected by a wireless\
    \ sensor (WS) network with climate information available through a\nweb platform\
    \ to actuate the electrovalves using ICT technologies. Likewise, all recorded\
    \ data were\nstored in the cloud, being accessible anywhere/anytime for advisory\
    \ services to farmers.\nAIS can be adapted to diﬀerent crops. In this work, it\
    \ was implemented in woody crops (peach\nand nectarine). A deﬁcit irrigation strategy\
    \ was applied, achieving savings of around 30% in water,\nenergy and labour costs\
    \ compared to the conventional irrigation system.\nIt should be considered that\
    \ the implementation of AIS in commercial farms involves the study of\nthe spatial\
    \ variability of the soil properties before the installation of the soil water\
    \ sensors in order to\nselect the monitoring point or points. A minimum of three\
    \ probes is required to adequately represent\nthe wet bulb. Hence, robust and\
    \ cheap sensors for soil, plant, and atmosphere measurements are\nneeded to promote\
    \ the adoption of AIS in farms.\nRegarding weather variables, real time and forecasted\
    \ weather information provided by public\nand private weather services could be\
    \ integrated in the irrigation schedule (rainfall time, intensity,\nETo) to improve\
    \ its accuracy [155,156].\nSensor, hardware and software providers are currently\
    \ involved in a process to enable the design\nof customized AIS based on SCADA\
    \ or other middleware [155] to process inputs and operate irrigation\nnetworks\
    \ in real time. Additionally, APPs implemented on hand-pocket smart devices will\
    \ provide\ndecision makers with an easy access to real-time data [62,156].\nLikewise,\
    \ the WS networks, as well as the other technological components of AIS, require\n\
    supervision and maintenance and a minimum level of knowledge for their handling\
    \ and interpretation\nof the data. If the user does not have such knowledge, he/she\
    \ should use technical advisory services.\nThe investment in the AIS (from 3000\
    \ €, investment + operation) and the need for knowledge are the\nmain limiting\
    \ factor for commercial application of AIS. These deterrents have also been highlighted\
    \ in\nother studies carried out in Australia, USA or European countries, such\
    \ as Italy and Portugal [61,157–159].\nIn these analyses, authors state that farmers\
    \ tend to maintain traditional agricultural practices and are\nusually reluctant\
    \ to adopt new technologies [157]. In addition, the maintenance costs required\
    \ is also\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n17 of 26\na limiting factor for the incorporation\
    \ of these new technologies [157]. Hence, knowledge exchange\nbetween researchers,\
    \ farmers and other stakeholders is recommended to encourage the technological\n\
    development and automation of irrigated agriculture [61].If this approach is properly\
    \ transferred\nto the irrigation community, it will be a great step forward in\
    \ the eﬃcient use of water in irrigated\nagriculture. Thus, in regions with permanent\
    \ water scarcity and high-value crops (e.g., Mediterranean\nenvironments), AIS\
    \ can be worthwhile by underpinning highly proﬁtable production with lower water\n\
    endowments than traditional systems.\nFurthermore, models like MOPECO are the\
    \ core of decision support systems (DSS) that strengthen\nfarmers’ ability to\
    \ preserve their proﬁtability under low water availability conditions. MOPECO\n\
    provides valuable information to improve crops distributions before planting and\
    \ optimize irrigation\nscheduling in order to maximize water productivity. Additionally,\
    \ at the level of water resource\nmanagers, it is also an adequate tool to analyse\
    \ the eﬀects of water policies on the agricultural sector.\nMOPECO highlights\
    \ the importance of suitable management of irrigation water through proper\nmaintenance\
    \ and use of the irrigation system, as well as determining the most suitable irrigation\n\
    scheduling. In addition, under limited water availability conditions, MOPECO reduces\
    \ water allocation\nfor lower proﬁtable crops (i.e., barley) and reallocates them\
    \ to more proﬁtable crops.\nFarmers sometimes solve the lack of uniformity of\
    \ their irrigation systems by supplying larger\namounts of irrigation water than\
    \ that required by crops. This strategy is evidently not justiﬁable from\nan environmental\
    \ point of view, especially in areas where water is scarce. However, if water\
    \ cost is low\nand/or the water authority does not oﬀer any incentives to save\
    \ water, farmers may use this strategy\nbecause it is easier than evaluating their\
    \ irrigation system.\nIn addition to the lack of uniformity, irrigation schedules\
    \ must be overestimated considering\nevaporation and drift losses in order to\
    \ provide farmers with realistic values but avoiding percolation\nat least in\
    \ mostof the ﬁeld. These questions are even more signiﬁcant when proposing farmers\
    \ apply\nregulated deﬁcit irrigation methodologies in annual crops.\nMOPECO increases\
    \ crop WP as a way to increase the proﬁtability of farms by using the ORDI\nmethodology.\
    \ The drop in yield per unit of area is compensated for by a larger irrigated\
    \ area with a\nhigher WP, using the same amount of water within the farm. Consequently,\
    \ ORDI does not decrease\nthe amount of water used but increases the yield per\
    \ unit of water volume supplied to the crop.\nThis evidence has also been shown\
    \ in previous works carried out in Australia, Spain, Morocco, and\nthe Middle\
    \ East. In these studies, adopting eﬃcient irrigation systems has led to higher\
    \ water use\neﬃciencies but this water conservation has been used to expand the\
    \ irrigated area or to change to more\nproﬁtable crops [157–161].\nNevertheless,\
    \ the eﬀect of ORDI on the quality parameters of certain crops, such as horticultural\n\
    ones, must be analysed before advising farmers to use it. Thus, in crops such\
    \ as garlic or onion,\nORDI increased WP but the decrease in the size of bulbs\
    \ reduced their proﬁtability per unit of yield,\nquestioning the suitability of\
    \ this methodology in this type of crops. Moreover, the increase in the\ncultivated\
    \ area generates higher costs that must also be considered, although the cost\
    \ per unit of area\nis lower (lower amount of water, fertilizers, harvest costs,\
    \ etc.). Consequently, an economic analysis\nvalidated under real cropping conditions\
    \ is required in these cases.\nORDI can be useful for farms where the amount of\
    \ irrigation water is limited. The application of\nORDI in garlic and barley under\
    \ real management conditions showed an increase in WP, a reduced\nwater footprint\
    \ and a clear increase in the proﬁtability of farms and barley cropping areas\
    \ (and probably\nother cereals or low proﬁtable crops). Transferring this methodology\
    \ to the productive sector involves\nadapting these kinds of tools to the skills\
    \ and necessities of farmers and technicians.\nApplying models such as MOPECO\
    \ requires calibration and validation processes before use,\nas well as the availability\
    \ of local climatic data (public or private) and the installation of irrigation\n\
    control devices (ﬂow meters and soil moisture sensors), the number of which may\
    \ vary depending\non the total ﬁeld area and its soil uniformity, using at least\
    \ one monitoring point at two depths in\nthe most representative area of the ﬁeld\
    \ i.e., at the location of the major roots depth concentration\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n18 of 26\nand at maximum root depth for controlling percolation. All these\
    \ aspects entail costs for both the\npublic administration and farmers themselves\
    \ (individuals or associations), which maybe unaﬀordable\nfor certain farms. Thus,\
    \ in addition to developingthe tools and training the farmers and technicians,\n\
    the total cost of the system is around 4650 € + taxes + installation.\nTherefore,\
    \ the positive results of the advanced technologies presented (AIS and DSS) are\
    \ not\nwithout cost. They require investment in equipment, and expenditure on\
    \ operation and maintenance,\nas well as qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services.\
    \ Likewise, they need robust sensors, as well as\nthe availability of advanced\
    \ support services. In the case that such conditions are accomplished, these\n\
    technologies will only be able to provide value to farms with low water availability,\
    \ high proﬁtability,\nand substantial technical-economic capacity.\nBoth irrigation\
    \ programming approaches (AIS and DSS) are adequate tools to use irrigation water\n\
    eﬃciently only if they are properly implemented in high uniformity irrigation\
    \ networks. In irrigation\nsystems with no accurate hydraulic design and poor\
    \ maintenance (e.g., emitter clogging) water will\nnever be used eﬃciently no\
    \ matter how good the available irrigation management tools are.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This work reviews the main variables aﬀecting optimal irrigation scheduling and\
    \ their\ninterrelationships. Two approaches to irrigation scheduling conducted\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast\nSpain are presented: one based on real time\
    \ crop monitoring applied to woody crops at the farm scale\nand the other, for\
    \ arable crops, applicable at the regional, irrigation district, and farm scales,\
    \ based on\nwater management models.\nThe analysis of both evaluated case studies\
    \ shows that computer support and ICTs, availability\nof meteorological information\
    \ and crop data during the growing season, sensors, and irrigation\nprogrammers\
    \ among other elements are required to provide optimal irrigation scheduling solutions\n\
    and improved resource allocation under water scarcity conditions. Additionally,\
    \ to succeed in the\nadoption of these new water management technologies, well\
    \ designed and maintained hydraulic\nfacilities are needed.\nThis implies investment\
    \ and maintenance costs, which could make them\nunsuitable for low proﬁtability\
    \ farms.\nIn addition, adopting these approaches requires from the users technical\
    \ training and willingness\nto accept irrigation schedules based not only on personal\
    \ experience but also on data-driven\ndecision-making processes. Hence, irrigation\
    \ advisory services (public or private) can play a key role\nin driving this technology\
    \ change in the irrigation sector. More robust and cheaper sensors would also\n\
    contribute in this way.\nTherefore, to date, the return of these technologies\
    \ is worth the investments and costs required to use\nthem in the case of farms\
    \ with low water availability, high proﬁtability, and relevant technical-economic\n\
    capacity.\nSociety, as an end beneﬁciary, may also play a key role in this technological\
    \ change.\nThe demand for sustainable crops is closely linked to optimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling, which could raise\nthe price of agricultural products and thus tip\
    \ the balance in favour of the implementation of ICTs in\nirrigated agriculture.\n\

    • Supplemental irrigation is highly important for achieving yield and quality
    assurance to guarantee profitable crop production in dry years. • We modelled
    and mapped the financial benefits of supplemental irrigation in England and Wales.
    • A sensitivity analysis shows the impact of agroclimate, market and water supply
    conditions on irrigation benefits. • A better knowledge of the financial benefits
    of irrigation would support decision making in water resources planning to reduce
    the impacts of low flows on agriculture during drought periods. Abstract Irrigation
    is an essential component of crop production to meet retailer demands for premium
    quality when rainfall is insufficient. Under drought conditions, irrigation can
    be constrained by water resources availability, with consequent impacts on yield,
    quality and revenue. Whilst most agriculture in Europe is rainfed, greater dependence
    on supplemental irrigation could become more important in humid environments due
    to a changing climate with greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of
    droughts. By combining industry and farm level economic data, with geospatial
    information on agricultural land use, agroclimate, soils and irrigation practices
    within a GIS, this paper estimates the total financial benefit of outdoor irrigated
    production in England and Wales assuming no constraints in resource availability
    and optimal irrigation practices. The analysis suggests that the total net benefits
    of irrigation in a ‘design’ dry year are around £665 million, with an average
    irrigation water productivity in excess of £3.3 per m3 (close to £1.1 per m3 excluding
    soft fruit). Map outputs highlight significant regional differences in water productivity
    reflecting the composition of land use and the importance of crop mix in determining
    economic value. A sensitivity analysis to changes in agroclimate, market conditions
    (crop prices) and water supply (costs) illustrates how the benefits might change
    under contrasting scenario. The study highlights the importance of supplemental
    irrigation, even in a humid climate, and the risks that future droughts and/or
    constraints in water resource availability might have on agricultural systems,
    livelihoods and the rural economy. The implications for water resources and drought
    management are discussed. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    is becoming an increasingly scarce resource, not only in arid and drought-prone
    areas but also in more humid and temperate regions where traditionally rainfall
    has been abundant (Santos Pereira et al., 2002, Daccache et al., 2012). A drought
    is normally defined as a natural hazard caused by a period of abnormally low precipitation.
    Three main types of droughts can be distinguished: a meteorological drought, an
    agricultural drought, a hydrological drought. A fourth type, socio-economic drought,
    can also be defined, dealing with drought in terms of supply and demand, taking
    into account the impact of water shortages on socio-economic systems (Wilhite
    and Glantz, 1985). A meteorological drought is characterised by a prolonged period
    of low rainfall; an agricultural drought occurs when a lack of precipitation results
    in low soil moisture that affects crop growth and development; and a hydrological
    droughts typically occurs when precipitation deficits lead to below normal water
    levels in reservoirs and rivers for an extended period (AMS Council, 2013). Over
    the last three decades, the incidence of droughts in Europe has increased in both
    intensity and number, mainly in the Mediterranean region (European Commission,
    2007). The risk of drought and water scarcity is expected to increase in future
    in currently dry regions due to a range of factors including climate change and
    population growth (IPCC, 2014). The agricultural sector is particularly sensitive
    to drought and water scarcity because of its dependence on water, along with other
    weather-related factors (Knox et al., 2010a). Agriculture is the dominant user
    of freshwater in many countries, accounting for 70% of global water withdrawals
    (FAO, 2004, Calzadilla et al., 2010). Most irrigation occurs in arid and semi-arid
    areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support crop growth. In these areas,
    the inter-annual variability in irrigation application is relatively small as
    irrigation provides the majority of crop water requirements to sustain crop growth.
    Whilst such areas have tended to be the focus for most research on irrigation
    demand assessment, water efficiency and economic valuation (Hillel, 1987, Oweis,
    1997, Deng et al., 2006, Prasad et al., 2006), supplemental irrigation can also
    be critical in humid regions where it buffers the effects of rainfall variability
    so that the adverse effects of low soil moisture content on crop development and
    particularly quality are reduced (Oweis, 2005). Given an increasing emphasis on
    quality assurance, rather than solely yield, supplemental irrigation is essential
    to ensure the viability and profitability of particular crops in some regions.
    For example, there has been a marked increase in irrigation of high-value crops
    such as potatoes and field vegetables in the UK (Morris et al., 2014). However
    agricultural irrigation is often given the lowest priority for water allocation
    under drought conditions. This partly reflects a perception that the marginal
    value of water is relatively low in agriculture compared to its use in other sectors
    including public water supply, and that there is scope in drought conditions for
    increasing the ‘efficiency in use’ of agricultural irrigation. However, in humid
    regions, the small application depths applied to high-value crops primarily for
    quality assurance purposes can result in very high financial benefits, and hence
    the potential economic impacts of any water shortages (abstraction restrictions)
    can be substantial (Knox et al., 2000). In order to guarantee public water supply
    and maintain minimum environmental flows during droughts, the water regulatory
    agency in England and Wales (Environment Agency, EA) can impose partial or total
    bans on irrigation abstraction (EA, 2012, Defra, 2014), so water may not be available
    to farmers when needed (Knox et al., 2010b). This has occurred during recent drought
    episodes in 1995, 2003, 2006 and 2011–2012 (ADAS, 1999, Marsh, 2004, EA, 2006,
    EA, 2011a). For instance, formal restrictions were imposed on 600 spray irrigation
    licences during the 2006 drought, and 300 irrigators were affected by abstraction
    restrictions in the 2012 drought (EA, 2011b, Vivid Economics, 2013). Hess et al.
    (2011) estimated that more than half of the total area of irrigated production
    in England and Wales is currently located in catchments designated as being either
    ‘over-abstracted’ and/or ‘over-licensed’; these areas are therefore the focus
    of increasing attention to support more sustainable levels of abstraction through
    regulatory reform and the revocation of so-called ‘time-limited’ licences (perpetuity).
    In order to protect their interests some farmers have formed water abstractor
    groups (WAGs) to collectively share their risks and knowledge (Leathes et al.,
    2008), whilst others have taken individual actions including investment in storage
    reservoirs and precision irrigation. Drought combined with restrictions on irrigation
    abstraction can therefore have important agronomic and economic impacts on crop
    production. Whilst the impacts of drought on the value of output from UK agriculture
    as a whole have been assessed (e.g. ADAS (1999) for the 1995 drought; and Anglian
    Water and University of Cambridge (2013) for the 2010–2012 drought), there is
    much less understanding of the economic impacts of restrictions on supplemental
    irrigation in field-scale agriculture and horticulture. With a changing climate
    expected to increase irrigation demand (Weatherhead and Knox, 2015; Rodriguez
    Diaz et al., 2007; Else and Atkinson, 2010) and the frequency and severity of
    droughts also expected to impact on irrigated agriculture (Fowler and Kilsby,
    2004), this study builds on previous research (Morris et al., 1997, Knox et al.,
    2000) to provide the first comprehensive national spatial assessment of the financial
    benefits of supplementary irrigation, both in terms of yield and quality assurance
    in a dry year. This will support policies to better understand the impacts of
    abstraction restrictions in the sector, and to improve drought management strategies
    which balance impacts across different economic and environmental sectors. As
    a result, the farming community will be better equipped to estimate potential
    losses arising from drought, as will governments and agencies in deciding where
    and when to impose restrictions on agriculture with minimum economic impact. The
    analysis is applied to outdoor irrigated cropping in England and Wales, but the
    approach is applicable in other countries where appropriate datasets are available.
    The methodology and outputs also have significant implications for the implementation
    of abstraction controls within the Water Framework Directive (WFD). 2. Material
    and methods In summary, a four staged approach was developed: 1. Deriving and
    mapping agroclimate variability using potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) as
    an aridity indicator; 2. Modelling and mapping theoretical volumetric irrigation
    water demand for the major irrigated crop categories during a design dry year;
    3. Mapping the financial value of supplemental irrigation, by crop category and
    per unit of water applied (water productivity), and; 4. Conducting a sensitivity
    analysis to assess how the irrigation benefits might change under contrasting
    agroclimate, market (price) and water supply (water price) conditions. A brief
    description of each stage is given below. 2.1. Mapping agroclimate variability
    A dry year in England and Wales in irrigation terms is typically characterised
    by periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration (ET) from June to August
    (Weatherhead et al., 1997). The combined effects of rainfall and ET on irrigation
    demand can be reflected via an aridity index using potential soil moisture deficit
    (PSMD). The advantage of using PSMD over other agroclimatic indicators (e.g. Standardised
    Precipitation Index, SPI) is that the distribution of rainfall and ET throughout
    the year is taken into account. It can also be used to identify the dryness or
    wetness of a specific location for a given year. The index has been widely used
    internationally to quantify irrigation needs at different scales and assess climate
    impacts on water demand (Knox et al., 1997, Knox et al., 2010a, Knox et al., 2010b,
    De Silva et al., 2007, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2007). It is also used by the regulatory
    authority in England and Wales for setting licences (permits) for irrigation abstraction
    (Rees et al., 2003). In this study, the PSMD index for 2010 was calculated using
    a 5 km × 5 km gridded monthly climatic dataset from the UK Meteorological Office
    derived from observed historical weather data collected from a range of meteorological
    stations spatially distributed across the UK (Perry and Hollis, 2004). The rationale
    for using 2010 data was twofold: Knox et al. (2014) reported that 2010 closely
    approximated to a ‘design’ dry year in irrigation terms (statistically defined
    as the unconstrained water demand with an 80% probability of non-exceedance);
    secondly, national irrigated area data were available from the most recent 2010
    Defra Irrigation Survey (Defra, 2011). Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was
    calculated using the gridded monthly temperature, solar radiation, wind speed
    and relative humidity data and the FAO Penman-Monteith combination equation (Allen
    et al., 1998). Using monthly rainfall ( ) and reference evapotranspiration ( )
    data, the PSMD (mm) for each month ( ) is calculated as following: (1) In months
    where , any initial soil moisture deficit is filled and hence . In the UK, soil
    moisture deficits typically start to build up in early spring as ET > P, peak
    in mid-summer (July–August) and then decline to zero through autumn and winter
    as P > ET. Therefore in the UK, the estimation of PSMD can start with January
    as month t = 1. The maximum PSMD of the 12 months of each year is the PSMDmax
    value assigned to that year at that location. A map showing the spatial variation
    in PSMDmax for England and Wales at 5 km grid resolution for 2010 was produced
    and then used to estimate volumetric irrigation demand. 2.2. Mapping theoretical
    volumetric irrigation demand (m3) The spatial volumetric irrigation needs of the
    main outdoor crop categories in England and Wales were derived by applying the
    methodology developed by Knox et al. (1997) to spatial datasets of climate, soil
    type, crop areas and irrigation survey results. In summary, Knox et al. (1997)
    used a daily time-step water balance model (Hess, 1996) to calculate the theoretical
    unconstrained annual irrigation need (mm) for each of the major irrigated crop
    categories (potatoes, field vegetables, sugar beet, soft fruit, orchard fruit,
    grass, and cereals) grown on a contrasting range of soil types at agroclimatically
    contrasting locations. These results were then correlated using linear regression
    analyses against the PSMDmax. Knox et al. (1997) developed formulae for each crop
    relating the theoretical irrigation need for any specific year or location to
    soil type and agroclimate (PSMDmax). The spatial volumetric water demand in a
    grid square was calculated by applying the regression relationships derived by
    Knox et al. (1997) for each crop type to the gridded agroclimate dataset (PSMDmax)
    for 2010, taking account the spatial distribution of soil types from the National
    Soil Map1 and estimated irrigated area (ha) in each grid pixel. The irrigated
    area within each catchment was calculated using a GIS by applying the 2005 and
    2010 Defra Irrigation Survey results to the 2 km × 2 km gridded land use dataset
    derived from the Defra, 2011 June Agricultural Census data. Three different soil
    types were considered for calculating theoretical water demand, depending on available
    water capacity (AWC): low AWC (<100 mm/m), medium AWC (100–175 mm/m), and high
    AWC (>175 mm/m). 2.3. Mapping the financial value of supplemental irrigation (£/m3)
    The positive effect that irrigation has on crops, both in terms of yield and quality
    (and therefore revenue) (Weatherhead et al., 1997) is crop specific since each
    crop responds differently to the same volume of water applied. Several studies
    have estimated the yield response to irrigation (e.g. Morris et al., 1997; based
    on experimental data and farm records) allowing us to estimate the average net
    yield increase for each unit (mm) of water applied (Table 1). This is then up-scaled
    to estimate the net yield increase in each grid pixel according to the theoretical
    irrigation need (based on the local soil type and PSMDmax). However, irrigation
    also has a very important effect on quality which is critical for some crops;
    for example, on potatoes it is used to limit the incidence of common scab (Streptomyces
    scabies spp.) which causes skin imperfections or for lettuces where water shortages
    can negatively impact on size, shape and leaf defects. Irrigation is also essential
    for soft fruit (strawberries) since the majority of the crop is grown under temporary
    polytunnels to prevent rain damage and thus attain Grade 1 class fruit, which
    has a much higher price than the strawberries sold for processing. In this study,
    we estimated the benefits of irrigation on crop quality, expressed as a percentage
    increase in crop price (£/t) based on published literature corroborated by farmer
    interviews. These data have been used to derive estimates of the quality benefits
    of irrigation for each crop and soil type (Table 2). All costs and prices used
    in this assessment, including the additional costs due to increased production
    shown as in Table 1 were checked and confirmed with horticultural and soft fruit
    growers via a series of face-to-face interviews in 2015. Table 1. Main economic
    data and crop yield response to irrigation. Crop category Crop pricea (£/t) Additional
    costs due to increased production (% gross benefit)b Average crop yield response
    per hectarec (t/mm) Early potatoes 155 15% 0.08 Main crop potatoes 104 15% 0.08
    Cereals (wheat) 110 3% 0.02 Sugar beet 31 10% 0.13 Vegetables (carrots) 95 15%
    0.13 Soft fruit (strawberries) 600 25% 0.03 Grass- graze 95 0% 0.03 Grass- silage
    95 22% 0.03 Orchard fruit (dessert apple) 479 25% 0.02 a These represent the average
    national crop price (£/tonne, adjusted for inflation using the Agricultural Price
    Index for the UK, which measures the monthly price changes in agricultural outputs
    and inputs for all major crops). Information was collected for all crop categories
    over the past three drought episodes in the UK (2003, 2004–2006, 2010–2012), from
    the relevant years of the Farm Business Survey (e.g. Defra 2005), the Agriculture
    in the English regions (e.g. Defra 2006) and the Farm Management Pocketbook (e.g.
    Nix, 2010). b Extra costs associated with the additional production due to irrigation.
    These include: additional harvesting, handling, drying and if relevant, direct
    packaging and marketing costs (Morris et al., 1997), but not the variable costs
    of irrigation. c Average yield response to irrigation, normalised by irrigation
    depth, obtained from previous experimental data and field experience in the UK
    from Morris et al. (1997). A simplifying assumption of a linear relationship between
    irrigation depth and yield is used to estimate irrigation benefits, given the
    impracticability of calibrating biophysical crop models to characterise the non-linear
    response for all combinations of agroclimate, soils and crop type across the UK.

    water capacity (AWC) soils, expressed as% increase in the rain-fed crop price.

    0% 0% 5% Sugar beet 0% 0% 5% Vegetables (carrots) 6% 15% 30% Soft fruit (strawberries)a
    429% 429% Grass 0% 0% 5% Orchard fruit (dessert apple) 14% 20% 25% a The very
    large price benefit due to irrigation for strawberries reflects the difference
    in price between Class 1 strawberries (that can only be achieved with irrigation,
    and have an average price of £3150 per tonne) and the lower quality strawberries
    that result if growers are unable to meet crop water requirements in a dry year
    (and sold for processing at an average price of £600 per tonne. Conventionally,
    it is assumed that crop prices rise during a drought as agricultural production
    is affected by weather conditions (FAO et al., 2011). However, the final impact
    on price is influenced by many other factors, such as the timing and onset of
    the drought, world market prices and the extent to which imported products affect
    the local domestic food market. Thus, in estimating the benefits of irrigation
    in financial terms, the average crop price (£/tonne, adjusted for inflation using
    the government Agricultural Price Index for the UK) over the past three drought
    episodes in the UK (2003, 2004–2006, 2010–2012) were used (Table 1). Regionally
    disaggregated price information is available for some crop types, but not all;
    we therefore assumed national average crop prices for our analysis, having checked
    that differences were not significant across the country for the available price
    data (for instance, the price of cereals has a coefficient of variation (CV) across
    regions <0.05 cereals and <0.16 for potatoes). Price data for these periods were
    drawn from various sources including Defra, 2005, Defra, 2006, Nix, 2010.2 For
    each crop, the additional costs associated with the increased production (e.g.
    during harvest, handling, drying) (Table 1) were deducted from the gross benefit.
    The variable irrigation costs (repairs, fuel, labour and machinery, water charges)
    were also deducted. The costs of irrigation vary considerably depending on local
    circumstances, the type of irrigation system, the water source and crop water
    requirements (Morris et al., 2014). For calculation purposes, we assumed average
    variable costs of irrigation in the UK (1.50 £/ha mm, based on Nix (2010)). By
    combining the yield and quality benefits, the total financial benefit of supplemental
    irrigation can be estimated. Here, we consider only the extra net benefits derived
    from irrigation in comparison with the benefits that the farmer would get from
    the same crops grown under non-irrigated conditions (the counter-factual); i.e.
    the added value associated with irrigation relative to rainfed production.3 Fig.
    1 shows that the yield and quality benefits are multiplicative, not additive,
    as the quality premia are relevant to the whole crop not just the yield increase.
    From the gross benefits illustrated in Fig. 1, the irrigation costs and additional
    costs associated with higher levels of production must be deducted to obtain the
    net extra margin (£/ha mm) derived from supplemental irrigation. Download : Download

    each of the eight major irrigated crops (namely, early potatoes, maincrop potatoes,
    cereals, sugar beet, vegetables, soft fruit, grass, and orchard fruit); subscript
    s denotes the soil available water capacity (AWC) (high AWC, medium AWC and low
    AWC). A is the irrigated area of each crop (ha); W is the water average productivity
    (£/m3) and V is the theoretical irrigation water demand (m3). 2.4. Sensitivity
    analysis For each crop category, agroclimate (PSMD), crop price and water cost
    were assumed to have the greatest impact on irrigation benefit. Higher PSMD values
    imply higher irrigation needs (mm), and thus higher benefits derived from fulfilling
    crop water requirements, as the differences between rainfed and irrigated yield
    would be higher (Morris et al., 2014). Higher crop prices increase the benefit
    that irrigators derive from each incremental depth of water applied (mm) to their
    crops. Costs of water will have a direct impact on water productivity (£/m3).
    Using different agroclimate and price scenario, a sensitivity analysis was also
    undertaken to assess how the irrigation benefits might be impacted by changes
    in each of these variables. 3. Results 3.1. Irrigated production and water resource
    availability Fig. 2a shows the spatial variability in agroclimate across England
    and Wales for 2010, assumed here to represent a ‘design’ dry year, defined as
    a year with an 80% probability of non-exceedance. The areas of highest aridity
    (high PSMDmax) are concentrated in eastern and southern England, notably in Norfolk,
    Suffolk, Essex and Kent. These correspond to parts of the country where irrigated
    cropping is most concentrated (Fig. 2b) reflecting suitable soils and agroclimatic
    conditions for potato and field-vegetable production in East Anglia, and soft
    and orchard fruit production in Kent. The location of irrigated production is
    also closely correlated with (though not necessarily the cause of) water resources
    availability with 59% located in either over-licensed and/or over-abstracted catchments
    (Fig. 2c). In contrast, regions with the lowest aridity extend across much of
    Wales, the south west and north-west of England, reflecting higher rainfall and
    less suited land for intensive irrigated vegetable production. In these regions,
    rainfed production including extensive grassland for livestock is the dominant
    form of agricultural land use. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Maximum

    Irrigation water demand, value and productivity The calculated spatial distribution
    of volumetric irrigation demand in England and Wales is shown in Fig. 3a. Nationally,
    the majority (80%) of irrigation demand is concentrated in central and eastern
    England, notably in EA Anglian (130 × 106 m3) and EA Midlands (30 × 106 m3) regions.
    The total volumetric demand in 2010 (‘design dry year’) was estimated to be 200
    × 106 m3. Maincrop potatoes and vegetables have the highest irrigation demand,
    representing 56% and 23% of total theoretical water demand, respectively. Download

    irrigation benefit (£) and water productivity (£/m3) for England and Wales, by
    EA region. The financial benefit of irrigated production in 2010 was estimated
    to be £665 million. As shown in Fig. 3b, the highest benefits accrue in Anglian,
    Midlands and Southern EA regions, where high-value crops (soft fruit, potatoes
    and vegetables) are concentrated. Soft and orchard fruit has the highest average
    benefit per hectare (Table 3) with most production concentrated in EA Anglian
    and Southern regions. Maincrop potatoes are also an important irrigated crop in
    EA Anglian region, representing a significant proportion of total benefits in
    that area (close to 34%). Areas with lower irrigation benefits reflect areas where
    grassland and cereals dominate the land use mix. Based on the coefficients of
    variation (cv), it can be deduced that the spatial variability in irrigation benefits
    is very high for cereals and very low for maincrop potatoes and orchard and soft
    fruit (as these crops benefit from irrigation for quality assurance in almost
    all areas). Table 3. Irrigated area and estimated combined yield and quality benefits

    Orchard fruit 1,057 4.48 8,834 1,294.41 0.15 As discussed earlier, the total irrigation
    benefit is a combination of both yield and quality benefits which differ between
    individual crop types. Table 4 shows the relative contribution of each component
    to the total irrigation benefit for each crop. The irrigation benefits associated
    with quality assurance are higher than the yield benefits for soft fruit, maincrop
    and early potatoes. For example, more than 60% of the total benefit derived from
    irrigating vegetables in a dry year is derived from an improvement in quality.
    For other crops, such as grass, sugar beet and cereals, which have a much higher
    tolerance to drought and are not part of the fresh produce supply chain, most
    of the irrigation benefits are related to a yield increment with irrigation having
    a relatively low impact on quality. The proportion of irrigation benefits derived
    from quality improvements are also higher on low moisture retentive (AWC) soils
    (Table 2). Table 4. Estimated average contribution of yield and quality benefits

    3c shows the spatial distribution of benefits per unit of water applied (£/m3)
    or water productivity for the composition of land use in 2010. The most productive
    areas are mainly in the south-east and around the Bristol Channel (south and west)
    and in the midlands. The data for individual crop types shows soft fruit and early
    potatoes have the highest average water productivity (£52 and £1.94 per m3, respectively),
    with cereals (£0.08 per m3) and grass (£0.11 per m3) having the lowest values.
    Irrigation benefits tend to be highest for high-value (£/ha) crops, where irrigation
    can make most difference to yield and farm-gate price; and for crops that are
    associated with relatively high capital and labour production costs, helping to
    secure their viability. That is the case for strawberry production in the UK.
    The areas showing the highest water productivity (>£50 per m3) correspond to land
    where soft fruit is the only crop being irrigated. Expressing net benefits per
    unit of irrigation in this way, however, attributes all net benefits of crop production
    to the irrigation activity, rather than sharing it amongst the various components
    of investment, on the understanding that irrigation is an essential, non-substitutable
    component of production. These high returns to water are indicative of the essential
    nature of irrigation in England and Wales, where water adds most value in relatively
    intensive high-value, high-risk production systems. 3.3. Sensitivity analysis
    Sensitivity analysis can provide an insight into the impact that changes in agroclimate,
    crop price or irrigation costs can have on irrigation benefits. As mentioned,
    PSMD was used in this study as an agroclimate index. Fig. 4 shows the financial
    value of irrigated agriculture in England and Wales, for different agroclimate
    and crop price scenario. In a very dry year,4 with very high crop prices5 the
    total economic value of supplemental irrigation could reach almost £1130 million,
    assuming that crop irrigation needs are fully met. Cereals, grass and sugar beet
    are most sensitive (in terms of a percentage change in, albeit low, irrigation
    benefits) to a change in PSMD, with strawberries and early potatoes being least
    sensitive (Fig. 5). However, it should be highlighted that Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show
    the ‘relative’ changes, so for instance for cereals an increase of 148% in average
    benefit represents only £17/ha. Fig. 6 summarises the effects of changes in farm
    gate commodity prices on irrigation benefits. The analysis shows, for example,
    that if the price of cereals were to increase by 10% then the irrigation benefits
    would increase by nearly 40%. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Estimated

    6. Estimated changes (%) in average benefit by crop due to a change in crop price.
    If water resources become more scarce in future, then the water charges (£/m3)
    for agricultural abstraction are likely to increase, with the aim of reducing
    water use and improving irrigation efficiency. A change in water price will affect
    the benefits from supplemental irrigation and hence water productivity. Fig. 7
    shows the estimated change in water productivity (%) caused by a change in the
    cost of irrigation water for farmers in different regions. Changes in water costs
    have an important impact on water productivity, although they may not be significant
    depending on the crop mix. For example, a 50% increase in water costs would reduce
    water productivity (£/m3) by <2%. In those regions with a large proportion of
    high-value crops such as soft fruit and vegetables, the impact of an increase
    in water price will be lower, as our results demonstrate. Although current water
    charges represent a small percentage of the average total crop cost per hectare,
    if water prices were to increase, then the viability of irrigating some of the
    least-profitable crops (grass and cereals) would be further reduced. Download

    management This study represents the first international attempt to develop a
    national assessment of the financial benefits of supplemental irrigation for a
    defined dry year, compared to rainfed cropping, taking account of the spatial
    distribution of irrigated crops, and the factors that influence irrigation demand.
    For the eight crops examined, the highest irrigation benefit is for soft fruit
    (strawberries) and orchard fruit (dessert apples); and the lowest is for cereals
    due to the high differential in price between the crops, although differences
    across regions are also considerable. Our estimate of irrigation demand in EA
    Anglian Region is marginally higher (130 × 106 m3) compared to that (104 × 106
    m3) estimated by Knox et al. (2000). However, our results for the average benefit
    (£/ha) of irrigated maincrop potatoes are consistent with those reported by Morris
    et al. (2014). Since the work carried out by Morris et al., 1997, Knox et al.,
    2000, irrigated agriculture and demand for water has changed markedly (Weatherhead
    et al., 2015). This is partly due to the changes in cropped area and crop mix
    over the last decade together with changes in abstraction licensing and water
    allocation. Irrigation has become increasingly concentrated on fewer high-value
    crops; coupled with improvements in application technology scheduling and in-field
    management. The rising real cost of abstracted water and energy for pumping has
    also led to a reduction in irrigation on some crops where the benefits of irrigation
    were previously marginal, notably grass and sugar beet. At a national scale, Defra
    (2011) reported that the total irrigated area in England and Wales has decreased
    by 43.5% from 2001 to 2010, yet the benefit has increased In future it is likely
    that the frequency and severity of droughts in the UK will increase, potentially
    leading to an increase in crop water requirements. It is likely that irrigation
    will become more important but also more challenging, as there will be a greater
    probability of low water availability periods that will affect irrigators, since
    most agricultural production is concentrated in catchments that are already water
    stressed. Irrigated agriculture could lose its comparative advantage if constrained,
    unless the sector adapted to changing water availability. The economic rationale
    for irrigation is to secure water to add value, particularly through quality assurance,
    in areas that have comparative advantage for crop production. Many of these areas
    are in water deficit: thus there is an emerging ‘critical irrigation geography’
    with competing demands between water for irrigation and other uses. During drought
    conditions, irrigated agriculture is potentially exposed because of its greater
    dependency on water, with unintended outcomes and consequences. Irrigation may
    not help in severe drought conditions, unless drought responses for agriculture
    are explicitly ‘designed’ into farm irrigation plans and regional drought management
    strategies. According to the analyses presented here, the inability to irrigate
    in future dry years could lead to severe economic impacts for the farming community.
    Thus, to de-risk their businesses, a combination of irrigation with other drought
    management strategies will be essential. In recent decades farmers in the UK have
    invested in irrigation management to cope with a more uncertain water supplies,
    including for example, building on-farm water storage reservoirs, investing in
    more efficient technologies or creating water abstractor groups (Holman and Trawick,
    2011, NFU, 2015). In areas where increased irrigation from direct summer abstraction
    is not a viable option for coping with drought, other measures will need to be
    implemented, such as the selection of more drought-resistant varieties (Pidgeon
    et al., 2006) or changes in planting programmes to avoid late summer maturation
    (Wreford and Adger, 2010). These adaptation strategies would thus help reduce
    the potential losses in years when irrigation water was constrained. In England,
    irrigation constitutes only 4% of the total cropped area, yet it represents 20%
    of crop value (EA, 2008). In a dry year, the contribution of irrigated agriculture
    to the total crop value could be much higher. The benefits derived from irrigation
    vary spatially in England and Wales. Thus, the magnitude of drought impacts on
    these benefits will differ depending on which areas of the country are most affected.
    In a very dry year, as our sensitivity analysis suggests, some crops will be more
    affected (in terms of financial benefits) than others by an increase in aridity
    (PSMD). The results from this analysis could help guide water management decisions
    by regulatory authorities to minimize the overall economic impact of restrictions
    on water abstractions, changes in the abstraction licensing system and WFD implementation.
    This includes consideration of the economic impact on incomes, employment and
    livelihoods in the farm sector, the food and allied industries and other parts
    of the rural economy where irrigation is important. This wider perspective would
    also consider regional and national food supply and security issues placed under
    pressure during drought conditions, as well as the impacts of agricultural water
    abstraction on the environment. Apart from the potential impacts of abstraction
    restrictions on the financial benefits of irrigation highlighted in this paper,
    the water regulatory agency should also take into account the positive and negative
    externalities (i.e., more water for the environment vs. irrigated agriculture
    profitability, rural employment and food security), that imposing abstraction
    restrictions could have on the different water users and the environment. 4.2.
    Methodological limitations Finally, this work has some inherent limitations that
    should be recognised. The study by Morris et al. (1997) was applied to a specific
    area (Anglian region) where most irrigation is concentrated. Although some of
    the data used in this study have been updated, our analysis is informed by their
    results, which might cause errors in the estimation of the financial benefits
    of irrigation for other regions in England and Wales. Our assumption regarding
    the relationship between irrigation and crop quality could be improved by developing
    an irrigation- related quality indicator that could better explain variations
    in market price. The assumption of a linear relationship between irrigation depth
    and yield is considered the most feasible option to estimate irrigation benefits
    for most of the crops in this study, given the difficulty in calibrating biophysical
    crop models to simulate farm yields for all combinations of agroclimate, soils
    and crop type. However, it is also probably the greatest source of uncertainty
    given the assumption of linearity over the ‘relevant range’ of irrigation water
    use. Another potential source of error relates to the assumptions on irrigation
    cost. Although in England and Wales different irrigation systems and water sources
    (with different associated costs) exist, we assumed the costs associated with
    direct abstraction from a surface water (river, stream) and overhead application
    using a hose reel fitted with a gun (93% of the total irrigated area used hose
    reels in 2010 according to Defra (2011)). However, we recognise that other water
    sources are used, including groundwater and storage reservoirs which would change
    the structure of irrigation costs. Finally, we used ‘representative’ irrigated
    crops for some crop categories (i.e. carrots for vegetables, wheat for cereals,
    strawberries for soft fruit, apples for orchard fruit) which could introduce some
    uncertainty into our estimates. We also assumed that the counterfactual for irrigated
    crops would be the rainfed equivalent, which is reasonable as we are considering
    the costs of unexpected droughts or restrictions. However, the counterfactual
    in areas of highest irrigation needs is likely to be wheat or barley, rather than
    a rainfed equivalent of the irrigated crop. Finally, the financial assessment
    has not considered the economic impacts of crop switching due to, for example,
    changes in future land suitability and/or agroclimate conditions. Further primary
    data collection could help address the limitations outlined since most are related
    to constraints in farm level data availability. 5. Conclusions Drought episodes
    can severely impact on agricultural production in the UK, and are projected to
    become more frequent and extreme. This work presents a methodology to assess the
    geospatial financial benefits of supplemental irrigation in England and Wales.
    Despite the fact that many crops grown in the UK are rainfed, our analyses highlight
    the importance of supplemental irrigation to achieve yield and quality assurance
    to guarantee profitable crop production in dry years. In a future drier climate
    with greater aridity, irrigation would only become more crucial to buffer the
    impacts of the capricious nature of rainfall. Information arising from this work
    could support water resource planning and decision making to reduce the impacts
    of low flows on agriculture during drought periods. The procedure developed here
    could readily be applied to other crop types and/or mixes in other agroclimatic
    regions worldwide. Acknowledgements This research forms part of the Natural Environment

    February 2007 Abstract Introduction Methods and Materials Results and Discussion
    Conclusions Notation Acknowledgments References Information & Authors Metrics
    & Citations References Media Tables Share Abstract Crop evapotranspiration ( ET
    c ) was measured over a clean-cultivated, mature navel orange orchard with microsprinkler
    irrigation located near Lindsay, California. Hourly mean latent heat flux density
    was determined as the residual of the energy balance equation with measured net
    radiation, soil heat flux density and sensible heat flux density estimated using
    the surface renewal method. The ET c was compared with ET o calculated using hourly
    weather data and the ASCE-EWRI Penman-Monteith equation. Following pruning and
    topping of the trees in the spring of 2001, the K co values slowly increased as
    the canopy developed in the following season. An average K co = 0.82 was observed.
    In the following year, the mean summertime value increased to about K co = 0.95
    , and in 2003 and 2004, the summertime value averaged near K co = 1.00 , which
    is somewhat higher than observed for drip irrigated trees in southwestern Arizona
    and considerably higher than reported in the widely used Food and Agricultural
    Organization of the United Nations publications that were based on infrequent
    surface irrigation. Introduction Need for Updates Crop coefficient ( K c = ET
    c ∕ ET ref ) factors are determined using the maximum (i.e., no stress) crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) , which is assumed to be equal to the actual measured crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET a ) , and reference evapotranspiration ( ET ref ) , which is estimated from
    weather data and provides a measure of evaporative demand. It is assumed that,
    with similar crop, environmental and management factors, the product of derived
    K c values and ET ref , calculated from weather data, will give good estimates
    of ET c in future seasons. In general, this is true, but there clearly is a need
    to update and improve K c values for use in irrigation scheduling and water resource
    planning. For example, a wide range of crop coefficient ( K c ) values have been
    reported for mature citrus orchards (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977; Hoffman et al.
    1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987; Allen et al. 1998). The K c variations
    can be attributed to several factors including differences in (1) variety and/or
    rootstock, (2) tree spacing, (3) canopy height, (4) ground cover, (5) tillage,
    (6) leaf area index (LAI), (7) method for estimating reference evapotranspiration,
    (8) microclimate, (9) irrigation method and frequency, and (10) method of measuring
    crop evapotranspiration ( ET c ) . Recently, the ASCE-EWRI (2005) provided a standardized
    method to estimate reference evapotranspiration ( ET ref ) using a modified Penman-Monteith
    equation and monthly, daily, and hourly climate or weather data. Equations were
    published for a short ( h = 0.12 m ) reference canopy using the symbol ET o and
    for a tall ( h = 0.50 m ) reference canopy using the symbol ET r . In this paper,
    the ET o reference was used for the discussion, and the crop coefficient values
    were given the symbol K co . However, the crop coefficients relative to ET r (i.e.,
    K cr values) were also provided. In the earlier literature, different equations
    were used for ET ref , so making comparisons with current K co calculations is
    somewhat difficult; however, an attempt was made to use ET ref methods that are
    comparable. To differentiate ET ref methods in this paper, the symbol K c was
    used for crop coefficients from earlier literature where ET ref was not calculated
    using the ASCE-EWRI (2005) Penman-Monteith (PM) method, and K co is used for crop
    coefficients developed with the PM method for short canopies. From the literature,
    it was assumed that ET ref ≈ ET o . Citrus K c values for mature orchards (Hoffman
    et al. 1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987) and the corresponding ET
    ref values are presented in Table 1. Estimated K c values from the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations Paper 24 (FAO-24) (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977),
    which have been widely used, are also presented as K cf values for the three experiments
    listed in Table 1. The K cf values under Castel et al. (1987) are the same as
    for the no-till citrus in FAO-24. Under Hoffman et al. (1980), the K cf values
    are the same as clean-cultivated K c values from FAO-24. Based on recommendations
    in FAO-24, the K cf values for no-till orchards from Rogers et al. (1983) were
    increased slightly over the FAO-24 values to account for the more humid Florida
    climate. Although not directly cited in FAO-24, the source for the citrus K c
    data was identified by Hoffman et al. (1980) as MacGillivray (1975). Table 1.

    determined from Table 25 in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977). In Hoffman et al. (1980),
    the K cf values were estimated from the category “large mature trees providing
    70% tree ground cover and clean cultivated.” The K cf values for Rogers et al.
    (1983) and Castel et al. (1987) came from the category “large mature trees providing
    70% tree ground cover and no-tillage.” The K cf values are slightly for Rogers
    et al. (1983) because Florida has a more humid climate than Spain. The cited research
    was conducted in a range of climatic conditions from Florida, Valencia, Spain,
    and Arizona, and ET c was estimated using water balance calculations in all cases.
    In Florida and Spain, there was considerable rainfall, relatively low ET ref rates
    and nontilled orchards. In Florida, the orchards were irrigated with pop-up sprinklers
    and in Spain with border irrigation. In the southwestern Arizona desert, buried-drip-irrigated,
    clean-cultivated orchards were evaluated. The K c values in all three experiments
    were based on ET ref estimated from pan evaporation ( E p ) data using the conversion
    method presented in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977). The measured K c values presented
    in Table 1 were quite different from those reported in FAO-24 and in FAO-56 (Allen
    et al. 1998), illustrating the need for more research on this topic. In both Florida
    and Spain, there was considerable rainfall. Irrigation was supplemental to rainfall
    in Florida, and it was applied during relatively dry periods from November through
    April. The rainfall was about 70 mm mon − 1 (November–December) and about 50 mm
    mon − 1 (February–April). In Spain, the trees were border irrigated about every
    15 days during the dry (summer) season. The Arizona orchard was irrigated several
    times per day with a high frequency, buried-drip irrigation system. The FAO-24
    K c values for no-till orchards were generally lower than measured values in Florida
    and were higher than measured K c values in Spain. It is believed that part of
    the difference is due to pruning and grower management in the two locations. In
    FAO-56, it was noted that K c values may require adjustment for tree size and
    coverage. While the percentage ground cover was similar, European orchards tend
    to have their lower branches pruned up higher than in California, where the branches
    grow to near the ground, so the leaf area index (LAI) is higher in the United
    States. Rogers et al. (1983) noted that the ground cover was relatively dormant
    in Florida during February through April, which might explain the lower K c values
    observed in those months (Table 1). However, the higher K c values during May
    through October also occurred during the period with the most rainfall. The K
    c values reported by Hoffman et al. (1980) tended to be higher than the FAO-24
    estimates. Hoffman et al. (1980) attributed the lower K c values reported in FAO-24
    to earlier research in Arizona and California (Erie et al. 1965; MacGillivray
    1975). Hoffman et al. (1980) felt that the K c values in the earlier research
    were low due to inadequate soil moisture sampling. In addition, the use of high-frequency
    drip irrigation rather than infrequent furrow irrigation, which was common prior
    to 1980, might have enhanced plant water status and led to larger, more vigorous
    plants. Recently, growers have increasingly changed from surface and drip irrigation
    to microsprinkler irrigation (Snyder et al. 1996a), and, to our knowledge, crop
    coefficients for microsprinkler irrigated orchards have not been reported. In
    California, only water balance measurements have been used to estimate ET c for
    determining K co values of citrus. In addition, the K c data presented in Doorenbos
    and Pruitt (1977), Rogers et al. (1983), Castel et al. (1987), and Hoffman et
    al. (1980) were not developed with the ASCE-EWRI (2005) equations, and this might
    also explain some of the variation in observed K c values. As a result, there
    is a need to develop K co values for microsprinkler irrigated citrus orchards
    using the standardized Penman-Monteith (PM) method. Measuring Evapotranspiration
    with Surface Renewal In earlier research (Erie et al. 1965; MacGillivray 1975;
    Hoffman et al. 1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987), crop evapotranspiration
    was measured using a water balance approach. However, it is also possible to measure
    ET c using an energy balance approach. There are several energy balance methods,
    but the surface renewal (SR) method was selected for these experiments because
    of its low cost and portability. In the SR method, sensible heat flux density
    ( H ) is estimated using high-frequency temperature data. In combination with
    net radiation ( R n ) and soil heat flux density ( G ) measurements, latent heat
    flux density is calculated as the residual of the energy balance equation (explained
    later). The SR method (Paw U and Brunet 1991) is based on the concept of coherent
    structures, which are characterized by air sweeps and ejections to and from the
    surface (Gao et al. 1989). When in or near the canopy, air parcels are heated
    or cooled as sensible heat exchanges with canopy elements. The rate of air temperature
    change over time is related to sensible heat flux density (Paw U et al. 1995).
    Under unstable conditions, cool air sweeps into a canopy from above and the air
    parcels are gradually heated by the canopy elements. Hence, temperature traces
    initially drop sharply with time and are then followed by a slow rise as the air
    is heated. Then, the warmed air is ejected from the canopy, and it is again replaced
    by a sweep of colder air from above. Under stable atmospheric conditions, the
    pattern is reversed with a sharp temperature increase followed by slow cooling.
    The air temperature falls slowly as heat is transferred from the air to cooler
    plant elements. When plotted, temperature traces show ramplike characteristics,
    and the mean amplitude ( a ) and duration of ramp event ( d + s ) , where d is
    the duration of the ramp period and s is the duration of the quiescent period
    between ramps, can be quantified using structure function analysis (van Atta 1977).
    Based on many studies, the SR method seems to work well as long as the length
    of the mean ramp period is greater than five times the time lag used in the structure
    function analysis. Thus, for windy conditions or for measurements close to the
    soil (i.e., with a small volume of air), a higher sampling frequency might be
    required to meet the time lag versus frequency requirement. However, the citrus
    orchard had a large air volume under the temperature sensors, and there were mostly
    calm wind conditions during the experiments, so wind effects on the surface renewal
    measurements are unlikely. Using conservation of energy, Paw U et al. (1995) showed
    that an expression for H can be derived from the conservation of energy H = α
    H ′ = α ( ρ C p a d + s h ) (1) where h =measurement height (m); ρ =air density
    ( kg m − 3 ) ; and C p =specific heat of the air ( J kg − 1 K − 1 ) . The factor
    H ′ =SR sensible heat flux density assuming uniform heating from the ground up
    to the measurement height ( h ) , and α accounts for unequal heating of the air
    volume under the temperature sensor (Paw U et al. 1995). The α factor is determined
    by calculating the slope of the linear regression (through the origin) of H from
    an accurate independent method such as eddy covariance using a sonic anemometer
    versus H ′ (Snyder et al. 1996b; Spano et al. 1997, 2000). Note that Eq. (1) is
    a conservation of energy equation relating the change in temperature with time
    a ∕ ( d + s ) to the volume of air under the sensor, which is represented by the
    height h over a unit surface area. The α factor adjusts for the fact that the
    parcel of air entering or leaving the canopy is not uniformly heated or cooled
    by the canopy elements as it resides under the temperature sensor. Unequal heating
    or cooling mainly results from air penetration into the canopy and differences
    in foliage temperature with height rather than on the air temperature gradient
    in or above the canopy. Consequently, α depends more on canopy characteristics
    than on air temperature gradients. Thus, wind has little direct effect on the
    α value. In these experiments, α was determined by calibrating against a CA27,
    one-dimensional (1D) sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah).
    Before using the sonic anemometer, it was calibrated against two other 1D sonic
    anemometers and the root mean square error between the three sensors was about
    30 W m − 2 . When calibrating the SR method, the sonic anemometer was mounted
    about 0.5 m above the canopy top. The sonic anemometer data were collected at
    5 Hz with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. 21X data logger. As recommended by Campbell
    Scientific, Inc., the mean of the cross products of perturbations of air temperature
    and vertical wind speed were computed every 10 min , and the results were averaged
    and archived at the end of each half hour. Mean sensible heat flux density was
    computed as the product of the air density, specific heat of air at constant pressure,
    and the mean of the cross products. For a more detailed explanation of eddy covariance,
    see Shaw and Snyder (2003). After calculating H ′ , the sensible heat flux density
    α H ′ was computed using Eq. (1) and the α factor calibrated for that vegetation
    or crop type. For practical purposes, α changes little with stability, wind speed,
    or other weather factors. L E was determined using measured or estimated R n and
    G and α H ′ in the energy balance equation L E = R n − G − α H ′ (2) The L E calculations
    were done on a half-hourly basis, and the daily energy fluxes due to R n , G ,
    and L E were computed. Then the mean ET c for an hour expressed in J m − 2 s −
    1 was divided by the latent heat of vaporization ( L = 2.45 J g − 1 ) and multiplied
    by 3.6 to obtain the depth of water vaporized (mm). Methods and Materials Experimental
    Site The experimental site was an 8 ha ( 20 acre ) navel orange orchard in the
    Lindsay area of Tulare County in California on a Hanford sandy loam soil. The
    trials were conducted from 2001–2004 on 33–37 year old Frost Nucellar navel oranges
    with Troyer Citrange rootstock. The trees were planted at a distance of 5.8 m
    in the row and 6.1 m between rows for a total of 282.6 trees per hectare. The
    trees were vigorous and, even with pruning, grew from 4.0 m tall after topping
    in the winter of 2001 to 4.5 m tall in the late fall of 2004. The canopies mostly
    filled in between trees within rows (i.e., like a hedge row) with the foliage
    row width increasing from about 4.0 to 4.3 m giving approximately 66 to 70% ground
    shading. The tree rows were planted in an east–west orientation. The orchard floor
    was maintained vegetation-free using pre- and post-emergence herbicides. A low
    volume microsprinkler irrigation system was used. The irrigation lateral was positioned
    on the south side of each tree row about 0.5 m north of the edge of the tree row
    foliage with the emitter half way between two trees. A microsprinkler had a 360
    ° pattern and delivered 46 L h − 1 at an operating pressure of 172 kPa ( 15 psi
    ) . The irrigation system was operated on an alternate row basis, with every second
    row receiving a 24 or 48 h irrigation during an irrigation event. Therefore, only
    half of the orchard was irrigated at each event. The wetted area extended from
    the edge of the foliage on the north side of the tree row with the lateral to
    the edge of the foliage on the north side of the tree row immediately to the south.
    The throw radius was about 2.4 m (i.e., a surface area of about 18.1 m 2 ). Since
    the area per tree was about 35.38 m 2 and irrigations were applied to every second
    row, the wetted surface area for each irrigation event was approximately 26% of
    the orchard surface area. Decisions on irrigation timing and duration were made
    by the ranch management. Irrigation dates and amounts are indicated in Figs. 1–4.
    The irrigation frequency was about 4–6 days during summer, and it increased to
    about every eight days in October. There was no irrigation during the low ET,
    rainy season from November through mid-March. The orchard canopy was large, and,
    during an irrigation event, there was only a slight increase in L E and a related
    decrease in H . There was no observable direct effect of irrigation on either
    R n or G . Fig. 1. Daily plots of (a) reference and crop evapotranspiration; (b)
    crop coefficients with irrigation (solid column) and rainfall (dashed column)
    amounts during 2001. The irrigation depths correspond to the volume of water supplied
    to the entire orchard area, but the actual application was double the depth to
    half of the orchard. Fig. 2. Daily plots of (a) reference and crop evapotranspiration;
    (b) crop coefficients with irrigation (solid column) and rainfall (dashed column)
    amounts during 2002. The irrigation depths correspond to the volume of water supplied
    to the entire orchard area, but the actual application was double the depth to
    half of the orchard. Fig. 3. Daily plots of (a) reference and crop evapotranspiration;
    (b) crop coefficients with irrigation (solid column) and rainfall (dashed column)
    amounts during 2003. The irrigation depths correspond to the volume of water supplied
    to the entire orchard area, but the actual application was double the depth to
    half of the orchard. Fig. 4. Daily plots of (a) reference and crop evapotranspiration;
    (b) crop coefficients with irrigation (solid column) and rainfall (dashed column)
    amounts during 2004. The irrigation depths correspond to the volume of water supplied
    to the entire orchard area, but the actual application was double the depth to
    half of the orchard. At 46 L h − 1 , 24 and 48 h sets applied 1,104 and 2,208
    L , respectively, per 18.1 square meters of wetted area for each irrigated tree
    occupying 35.38 m 2 of surface area. This gave mean depths of 31.2 and 62.4 mm
    per tree surface area. Thus, typical summertime 48 h sets supplied sufficient
    water for slightly more than 10 days of ET c , assuming ET c ≈ 6 mm d − 1 . Weather
    Data for Crop Evapotranspiration Calculation Weather data used to calculate ET
    o using the Penman-Monteith equation (ASCE-EWRI 2005) came from the California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) station (Snyder and Pruitt 1992)
    at the University of California Lindcove Field Station located 19 km from the
    study site. Rainfall data were collected by the grower, using his own rain gauge,
    about 2 km from the orchard. Although a standard rain gauge was not used, the
    rainfall data were highly correlated with a standard gauge located in the City
    of Lindsay, which is about 5 km distance from the orchard. The grower also supplied
    the irrigation dates and runtimes. The irrigation system was evaluated to determine
    the mean application rate, which was used with the runtime to determine water
    applications. The precipitation and irrigation applications are shown in Figs.
    1–4. Hourly ET o values were summed over 24-h periods to obtain daily ET o data.
    Surface Renewal Station A surface renewal station was set up inside the orchard
    with more than 100 m of fetch in all directions and several kilometers of similar
    orchards surrounding the orchard. Fine-wire ( μ 76.2 μ m diameter) thermocouples
    (FW3, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) were used with a data logger (CR10,
    Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) to measure high frequency temperature.
    In addition, net radiometers (model Q7.2, REBS, Inc., Seattle, Wash.) and soil
    heat flux plates (model HT3, REBS, Inc., Seattle, Wash.) were used to measure
    energy balance components. Soil heat storage above the heat flux plates was measured
    with soil averaging thermocouple sensors (model TCAV, Campbell Scientific, Inc.,
    Logan, Utah). The TCAV soil temperature sensor consisted of four thermocouple
    probes that were wired in parallel, so the recorded temperature was the mean of
    four probe readings. Each of the four thermocouple probes was imbedded inside
    of a high-heat-conducting metallic cylinder having 1 mm diameter and 75 mm in
    length. Each thermocouple probe provided an integrated measure of the soil temperature
    in contact with the 75 mm metal cylinder. During the first two years, four pairs
    of probes were inserted horizontally in the soil at four transect locations at
    0.01 and 0.03 m depth. During the last two years, individual probes were inserted
    in an angle from 0.04 to 0.01 m depth in transect between tree rows. A 1D sonic
    anemometer (model CA-27, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) and a data logger
    (model 21X, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) were used to calibrate the
    surface renewal estimates of H . During 2003 and 2004, a second net radiometer
    (model NR Lite, Kipp and Zonen, AM Delft, The Netherlands) was added to confirm
    the accuracy of the Q7.2 net radiometer. The observed linear regression of the
    (REBS) Q7 R n versus the (NR) Lite R n was Y = 0.95 X ( R 2 = 0.99 ; n = 1,471
    ) and Y = 0.94 X ( R 2 = 1.00 ; n = 2,641 ) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The
    plotted points fell nearly on the 1:1 line up to about 500 W m − 2 , and the Q7
    values tailed off to about 50 W m − 2 lower than the NR Lite at 800 W m − 2 .
    Since the crop coefficients were already higher than any recorded, and use of
    the NR Lite data would have further increased the K c factors, the Q7 data were
    used for all energy balance calculations. The net radiometers were installed at
    5 m above the ground (about 0.5 m above the maximum height of the canopy top).
    Horizontally, the net radiometer was located midway between two trees within the
    measurement row, and it was oriented to the south with the bulb located midway
    between the tree trunk line and the south edge of the row tree foliage. The upper
    sensor dome was fully exposed to sunlight at all times. It is unlikely that the
    sensor placement height had an effect on R n readings because, although some of
    the soil was within the sensor view, there was no observable influence of irrigation
    (i.e., wetting the soil under the sensor) on R n observations. The net radiation
    data were collected every 60 s , and means were computed and converted to W m
    − 2 each half hour. During 2001 and 2002, two TCAV temperature sensors, with eight
    probes, were used, and pairs of the thermocouple probes were inserted horizontally
    at 0.01 and 0.03 m depth to measure soil temperature at four locations. Two probes
    were placed 1, 2, 3, and 4 m north of the tree trunk line of the tree row where
    the SR tower was located. The probe transect was perpendicular to the tree rows
    (i.e., south to north direction), and it was located about 1 m north of the tree
    trunk west of the transect line. Heat flux plates were placed at 0.04 m depth
    at 1.5 and 3.5 m north of the tree trunk line. Therefore, one of the heat flux
    plates was under the tree skirts, and the other was in the middle between rows.
    Data were collected every 60 s , and means of the heat flux plate readings were
    computed and converted to W m − 2 each half hour. The mean soil temperatures were
    also recorded every 60 s , but only temperature at the end points of each half
    hour were used to calculate the change in stored soil heat in the upper soil layer
    during the half hour period [see Eq. (3)]. Although the soil heat flux calculations
    were reasonable in 2001 and 2002, some spikes in the data were observed when sunflecks
    caused sharp temperature increases in the near-surface soil layer. As a result,
    the distribution of soil heat flux plates and soil temperature sensors was changed
    at the beginning of the 2003 season to obtain a better weighted mean value for
    soil heat flux density. A third heat flux plate was added to the measurements,
    and the three heat flux plates were inserted at 0.05 m depth. The heat flux plates
    and TCAV temperature sensors were again placed in transect between two rows. The
    transect row was perpendicular to the tree row containing the surface renewal
    tower. The first heat flux plate was located about 1 m east of the tree trunk
    immediately west of the surface renewal tower. A second plate was placed about
    2 m directly to the north of the first plate, and a third plate was placed at
    about 4 m directly north of the first plate. The soil temperature probes were
    relocated with one probe in line with the tree trunk row, and single probes were
    placed at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 m spacing to the north of the tree trunk
    row. The temperature probes were placed at an angle coming up from about 0.04
    to 0.01 m depth to obtain an integrated temperature in the soil layer above the
    plates. This method of placement increased the number of placement locations and
    provided a more uniform measure of the change in heat storage of the upper soil
    layer. The new placement of the soil sensors gave a more uniform estimate of soil
    heat flux density than in the first two years by eliminating fluctuations in soil
    temperature as the surface above the sensors passed from shade to sun and visa
    versa. The soil heat flux data were collected every 60 s , and means of the heat
    flux plate readings were calculated and converted to W m − 2 each half hour. Mean
    soil temperatures were also recorded every 60 s , but only the temperatures at
    the end points of each half hour were used to calculate the change in stored soil
    heat in the upper soil layer during the half hour period [see Eq. (3)]. The net
    radiometer, soil heat flux plates, and soil temperature data were measured every
    minute, and data were averaged over half hour periods. The average millivolt reading
    from the net radiometer and heat flux plates were computed, and the mean values
    were stored at the end of each half hour. Changes in soil heat storage ( Δ S )
    above the heat flux plates were computed using Δ S = C V ( T f − T i 1,800 ) z
    (3) where C V =apparent volumetric heat capacity of the soil; T f and T i =final
    and initial temperatures for a half-hour period; and z = 0.04 m or z = 0.05 m
    (in 2003–2004)=depth of the heat flux plate. The value 1,800 =number of seconds
    per half hour period. The C V is calculated as the product of the apparent soil
    density and the specific heat. The surface layer soil water content was measured
    through several irrigation cycles during 2003, and the water content varied between
    about 19% after irrigation to about 13% prior to irrigation with a weighted mean
    near 18%. The effect of varying the C V with water content on calculated G was
    minimal, so a fixed C V = 2.0 × 10 6 J m − 3 K − 1 , which corresponds to 18%
    moisture content, was used for determining the change in heat storage of the soil
    layer above the heat flux plates during the entire experiment. The soil heat flux
    density ( G o ) was calculated as the mean of the two heat flux plate measurements.
    Δ S was calculated using T f and T i from the averaging soil temperature probe
    and Eq. (3). Then, the soil heat flux density at the surface ( G ) was calculated
    following de Vries (1963) as G = Δ S + G o (4) The calculated surface G values
    were slightly less than 10% of R n on most clear sky days. In all years, the surface
    renewal temperature data were collected with two μ 76.2 μ m thermocouples mounted
    on a tower at 4.5 m above the ground. The sensors were on the ends of metal arms
    (about 0.3 m length) that were oriented to the west of the tower. There was approximately
    0.05 m distance between the two thermocouple junctions, so they were measuring
    the same air parcels. The wind speed is typically less than 2 m s − 1 and the
    direction is almost always from the north or south. With this orientation, it
    is unlikely that the tower had any effect on the temperature measurements. The
    peak canopy height increased from about 4 m in April 2001 to about 4.5 m in the
    spring of 2003. Because the thermocouples were mounted within a row between two
    trees, the canopy top dipped down somewhat below the thermocouples, and they were
    not within 1.5 to 2.0 m of any foliage. High frequency temperature data were collected
    at a frequency of f = 4 Hz , and the time lags of r = 0.5 and r = 1.0 s were used
    in a structure function (van Atta 1977) to determine the temperature ramp characteristics
    as described in Snyder et al. (1996b). The uncalibrated sensible heat flux density
    was calculated as H ′ = ρ C p ( a d + s ) z (5) In SR analysis, calibration (
    α ) factors are needed to account for uneven heating of the air below the temperature
    measurement height. Uncalibrated H ′ was converted to the actual sensible heat
    flux density ( H ) using the equation H = α H ′ (6) The α values depend on the
    thermocouple size, sampling frequency, height above the ground, and the underlying
    vegetation. In this research, calibration factors were determined as the slope
    of the linear regression of H , measured with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. (Logan,
    Utah) Model CA27, one-dimensional sonic anemometer, versus the uncalibrated H
    ′ from surface renewal measurements. Data were collected each half hour for 24
    h per day during May 6–13, 2001 and during July 27–30, 2001. The slope of the
    regression of H versus H ′ for May 6–13 was b = 0.227 with R 2 = 0.996 ( n = 328
    ) . The slope for July 27–30 was b = 0.226 with R 2 = 0.851 ( n = 154 ) . The
    calibration factor α = 0.227 was used for both 2001 and 2002 data. During 2003,
    the thermocouples were wired in parallel to a differential channel of the data
    logger, which changed the calibration factor from separately measured thermocouples.
    The height and orientation of the sensors were the same as in 2001 and 2002. Calibration
    data were collected each half hour for 24 h per day during the sampling periods,
    and regressions of H versus H ′ were computed. Data collected during the period
    June 9 through June 24 gave a regression slope b = 0.467 with R 2 = 0.855 ( n
    = 727 ) . Measurements during the period August 13–20, 2003 gave a slope of 0.461
    with R 2 = 0.767 ( n = 359 ) over a similar range of H . The calibration factor
    α = 0.467 was used during 2003 and 2004. The thermocouple wiring was changed in
    2003 to allow more channels for measuring soil temperature and heat flux to improve
    the soil heat flux estimates. Differences in the R 2 values between calibration
    periods were mainly due to differences in the range of sensible heat flux density
    during the measurement period. Data sets with larger range of sensible heat flux
    had larger R 2 values. Results and Discussion Fig. 1(a) shows the ET o and ET
    c data for 2001. Crop coefficients for the same experiment are plotted with the
    irrigation and rainfall data in Fig. 1(b). The corresponding plots are provided
    for 2002 (Fig. 2), 2003 (Fig. 3), and 2004 (Fig. 4). In all years, the energy
    balance calculations were similar. On a daily basis, the soil heat flux density
    was close to zero. During summer, the daily mean sensible heat flux density tended
    to be upwelling at around H = 5 MJ m − 2 d − 1 , the latent heat flux density
    was about L E = 15 MJ m − 2 d − 1 , and the net radiation was typically about
    20 MJ m − 2 d − 1 . In general, the ET o was between 6 and 7 mm d − 1 during midsummer
    in each year (Figs. 1–4). The ET c was somewhat lower than normal during April
    and May of 2003 when there was an atypical cool-rainy period. Crop coefficient
    ( K co ) values were higher (Figs. 1–4) than previously reported for clean-cultivated
    citrus orchards (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977; Hoffman et al. 1980; Allen et al.
    1998). In 2001, the K co values increased from about 0.70 to 0.85 during the summer.
    It is believed that the increase was due to canopy growth following topping and
    pruning prior to the 2001 experiment. During the summer of 2002, the K co values
    increased above 0.95. The K co factors were close to 1.00 during the summer of
    2003 and 2004. The ET o was slightly lower in 2003, and the orchard received more
    irrigation water during that year. In 2004, the ET o rate was higher in the spring,
    and the irrigation might have been slightly insufficient and possibly resulted
    in some water stress, with ET a < ET c during midsummer. The grower noted that
    the orchard appeared more stressed than usual during the 2004 season. The experimental
    orchard was vigorous with above average production and densely canopied trees
    (high-yielding grove with a dense canopy). The row orientation was east–west rather
    than north–south, because the orientation improves cold air drainage during frost
    conditions. Although row orientation was not reported in the other literature,
    this might partially explain the higher K co values observed in these experiments.
    Another possible reason for the higher summer K co values observed in this experiment
    is the use of microsprinkler irrigation rather than surface irrigation and higher
    application frequency in this orchard. The drip irrigated orchard in the Arizona
    experiments (Hoffman et al. 1980) had K c values near 0.85 during the summer,
    so the higher K c values for the microsprinkler irrigated orchard seems reasonable.
    In the California experiments, the orchard had 70% ground cover (i.e., 70% of
    the ground was shaded by tree foliage) and, during the summer, it was irrigated
    by the microsprinkler approximately every 5–6 days. Irrigation was applied to
    every second row (half of the orchard) at each application. In the widely used
    papers by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and Allen et al. (1998), the crop coefficient
    for clean-cultivated, mature with greater than 70% ground cover citrus is given
    as K c = 0.65 for June through August. However, it is likely that the values came
    from research on flood or furrow irrigated citrus orchards prior to 1977. Hoffman
    et al. (1980) noted that there was inadequate sampling of soil water content changes
    in earlier research. Therefore, the FAO numbers may be too low for dense canopy,
    vigorous, sprinkler-irrigated orchards in the arid western United States. From
    October through April, many of the K co values were unrealistically high and variable
    (Figs. 1–4). For example, extremely high values of K co were observed prior to
    May 2003 (Fig. 3) because of the late spring rain during that year. The high and
    variable K co values were attributed to a combination of factors related to the
    rainy-foggy conditions that are typical of the region during late fall, winter,
    and spring: 1. There was a greater chance of ET c measurement error(s) due to
    wet sensors. In surface renewal, like all aerodynamic methods, energy balance
    calculations are more questionable when the sensors are wet. There was no way
    to know if the thermocouples were wet or not in the research reported here, so
    there was no attempt to filter out those data. Wet net radiation sensors were
    most likely the reason for the unrealistically high K c values observed during
    low- ET o , rainy months, so those data were filtered out of the analysis presented
    in Figs. 1–4; 2. Canopy resistance near zero was expected for the wet crop, whereas
    the canopy resistance used for calculating ET o was fixed at 50 s m − 2 when R
    n > 0 (ASCE-EWRI (1998)). This factor and the higher net radiation over the orchard
    partly explain why the K c values were higher for the citrus orchard; 3. The K
    co for wet soil in the rainy season is higher than for drier soil during high
    ET o conditions in summer; 4. Weather conditions are more spatially variable during
    the cool-rainy season, so differences in weather between the Lindcove CIMIS station
    site and the orchard were more likely; and 5. The fraction of canopy light interception
    was greater in the fall, winter, and spring than in the summer when sunlight can
    penetrate to the bare ground between rows. The late-fall, winter, and early-spring
    K co values were clearly too high because of the aforementioned factors. In fact,
    it is unlikely that the K co values for citrus orchards would be higher than the
    ratio of ET r ∕ ET o , where ET r is the reference evapotranspiration for tall
    canopies (ASCE-EWRI 2005). Using weather data from the nearby Lindcove CIMIS station,
    the ratio ET r ∕ ET o ≈ 1.15 was observed. Since there were also unrealistically
    low K co values during the low- ET o , rainy-foggy season, but the extremely high
    K co values were more common, a fixed value of K co = 1.15 is recommended during
    the low- ET o , rainy-foggy season. Because the canopy was growing and K co values
    were increasing during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, the orchard was not fully intercepting
    light, and the K co values increased during the summer (Table 2). Note that ET
    r rates and K cr factors are provided in Table 3. There was no evident increase
    in K co during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Therefore, the mean monthly K co values
    for the 2003 and 2004 seasons were computed to represent a mature orchard (Table
    4). Presenting K co values to the nearest 0.01 implies too much accuracy, and
    the unrealistically high K co factors during the low- ET o , rainy-foggy period
    are misleading, so the K co values were rounded to the nearest 0.05 with an upper
    limit of 1.15 to provide recommended crop coefficient factors ( K co ′ ) for ET
    o (Table 4). Then ET c was calculated using the mean daily ET o rates by month
    from 2003 and 2004 and the observed ( K co ) and recommended ( K co ′ ) values.
    The difference in ET c rates ( Δ D ) and monthly totals ( Δ M ) calculated from
    observed and recommended K co values were compared (Table 4). Except for the low
    ET o , rainy-foggy period, the error from using the recommended K co values was
    less than one day per month of ET c . The recommended K co values can therefore
    be used for estimating the ET c of clean-cultivated, microsprinkler irrigated,
    mature orchards in the San Joaquin Valley of California or in regions with similar
    climatic conditions. In areas with a different climatic pattern of rain and fog,
    the coefficients may need adjustment. During the drier, high ET o summer, the
    value K co = 1.00 should provide good estimates of ET c for similar orchards and
    climates. Table 2. Reference Evapotranspiration for Short Canopies ( ET o ) and

    irrigated citrus grown in a similar climate as the San Joaquin Valley of California,
    which is characterized by warm, arid summers and cool, foggy-rainy winters. The
    results of these experiments depend on accuracy of the SR method, which in turn
    depends on accuracy of the sonic anemometer used to calibrate the SR estimates
    of H . There has been some concern expressed about the lack of closure in eddy
    covariance measurements. In particular, Twine et al. (2000) noted that there are
    three possible methods to estimate L E from (EC) measurements. The direct L E
    measurement from the EC system can be used, or L E can be calculated as the residual
    of the energy balance equation as was done in this experiment. Another possibility
    is to calculate the Bowen ratio and increase the values of H and L E until closure
    is attained while maintaining the measured Bowen ratio. In fact, none of these
    methods has been proven to be superior to the others. If it is assumed that the
    Bowen ratio with 80% closure is correct and one increases the values for H and
    L E , while maintaining the Bowen ratio, until the closure reaches 100% for a
    clear-sky R n − G = 700 W m − 2 , the increase in H value is about 15 W m − 2
    . For periods with smaller R n − G , the increase in H would be less. A multiplication
    factor that increased peak midday H values 15 W m − 2 was determined and applied
    to increase all of the H data by that factor. Then, using the higher H values,
    a new α factor for surface renewal H was computed and applied to the 2004 data.
    The new K c values were between 0.01 and 0.02 lower than the results presented
    in this paper. Some concern has been expressed about using the surface renewal
    method during foggy-rainy periods because of the observed high K c values. No
    aerodynamic method will provide accurate ET results, when the sensors are wet,
    so surface renewal is no different than any other method. In the case of California,
    the wet period is mainly during the winter months when ET o rates are low, so
    estimating the ET c as slightly higher than ET o (i.e., as ET r ) is a reasonable
    method to estimate ET c . In locations with rainy summers, using aerodynamic methods
    is more problematic. To ensure K c accuracy, data from aerodynamic methods in
    rainy summer climates should probably be filtered to use only days when the sensors
    are dry. An additional problem arises under foggy-rainy conditions, because the
    ET o equation uses fixed values for canopy resistance, whereas a citrus orchard
    canopy resistance can change dramatically depending on whether the trees are wet
    or not. The canopy resistance approaches zero when wet, so the K c values will
    increase when the canopy is wet. Conclusions For healthy, microsprinkler irrigated,
    mature (about 70% ground cover) navel orange orchards with rows oriented in an
    east–west direction, a crop coefficient K co = 1.00 , with lower values in years
    following extensive pruning and topping, can be used during summer in an arid
    climate. Most likely, the difference in K co following pruning was due to reduced
    light interception by the orchard canopy. The observed summer K co values were
    considerably higher than reported for orchards with a crop cover in Spain that
    were infrequently irrigated using surface irrigation. Generally, the observed
    K co values during June through September were not as high as for orchards with
    a cover crop in Florida (Table 1). However, because the orchards in Florida had
    cover crops and they were frequently wetted by rainfall, this was not unexpected.
    The observed K co factors were higher than K co values observed for buried-drip-irrigated
    orchards in the southern Arizona desert. Since there was more wetted soil surface
    and a lower ET o rate observed in these experiments, the results seem realistic.

    \ largely neglect the spatial and temporal variations in ET. Accurate regional\
    \ ET maps would provide valuable information \non actual crop water use. The objective\
    \ of this study was mainly to evaluate a Pilot Project (PP) supported by the Food\
    \ and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO). In this study, Surface\
    \ Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was used to \nassist the evaluation\
    \ attempt. The performance of the ET model was evaluated by comparing the predicted\
    \ daily ET with values \nderived by conventional methods based on ground measurements\
    \ and meteorological data on 6 Sepetmber, 25 Sepetmber, 28 \nNovember and 11 December.\
    \ The ET values from SEBAL showed good agreement with the actual values measured\
    \ in the field. The \namount of water required to satisfy the irrigation needs\
    \ at canal level was monitored and successfully estimated. However, during \n\
    November the daily estimated water demand ranged from 15667 m3 for Tereifi minor\
    \ to 28954 m3 for Heleiwa west minor canal. The \naverage values of relative irrigation\
    \ supply (RIS) were determined as 0.73 which indicates improvements in operational\
    \ performance \nof minor canals. The results of this study demonstrate that remote\
    \ sensing measurements and limited ground data can be used to \nsuccessfully estimate\
    \ ET and assess irrigation performance in areas of poor infrastructure. Results\
    \ achieved support previous opinion \nthat repeatedly recommended the PP as a\
    \ crucial step for water management in the Gezira scheme, Sudan. \n \nKeywords:\

    \ \n \n \n1. Introduction \nThe Gezira scheme is Sudan’s oldest and largest gravity\
    \ \nirrigation system, located between the Blue Nile and the White \nNile. Started\
    \ in 1925 and progressively expanded thereafter, it \ncovers about 880,000 ha,\
    \ receives water from the Sennar Dam \non the Blue Nile and is divided into some\
    \ 114,000 tenancies. \nFarmers operate the scheme in partnership with the government\
    \ \nand the Sudan Gezira Board (SGB) that provides administra- \ntive, credit\
    \ and marketing services. The scheme has played an \nimportant role in the economic\
    \ development of Sudan, serving \nas a major source of foreign exchange earnings\
    \ and of govern- \nment revenue. It has also contributed to national food security\
    \ \nand to generating a livelihood for the 2.7 million people who \nlive in the\
    \ command area of the scheme. \nSince its stabilshment, the task of irrigation\
    \ management \nwas entrusted to the SGB and Minstry of Irrigation. Recently, \n\
    low crop productivity, poor water management performance, \ninsufficient financial\
    \ for operation and maintenance costs, and \nvery low water fee collection efficiencies\
    \ from the farmers \n                                                        \n\

    \ to partially transfer the authority of irrigation \nmanagement to local irrigation\
    \ committee. Abdel Hakam block \nwas selected for testing the irrigation management\
    \ transfer pro- \ncess in a pilot project (PP) supported by the FAO during 2000\
    \ \n~ 2002. About 12 local irrigation committees were formed at \nthe block level.\
    \ \nUnder the new structure of irrigation management, the lo- \ncal irrigation\
    \ committee responsible for providing all services \nrelated to the operation\
    \ and maintenance of the minor irriga- \ntion system. However, irrigation responsibilities\
    \ of the upper \nsystem (main canals) are shared between SGB and Ministry of \n\
    Irrigation. \nThe PP was evaluated for a variety of management objec- \ntives\
    \ to assess the irrigation performance. Numerous indicators \nhave been proposed\
    \ during last decades such as the area irri- \ngated, crop patterns and distribution\
    \ and delivery of water (Ab- \nernethy, 1986; Levine, 1982; Molden and Gates,\
    \ 1990). \nThis study was conducted to assess the variations of some \nperformance\
    \ critera during the implementation period of the \nPP such as spatial ET, crop\
    \ yield and relative irrigation supply. \n2. Methodology \n2.1. Study Area and\
    \ Data Used \nThis study was focused on Abdel Hakam block (Figure 1) \nM. A. Bashir\
    \ et al. / Journal of Environmental Informatics 13(2) 86-92 (2009) \n \n87 \n\
    which is located in the Central Group of the Gezira scheme (La- \ntitude 14º 23'\
    \ N and Longitude 33º 23' E, elevation 409 m) with \ntotal irrigation command\
    \ area around 6,000 ha and crop intensi- \nty of 80%. The main summer crops cultivated\
    \ during the 2001/ \n02 season were sorghum (2,495 ha), cotton (768 ha) ground-\
    \ \nnuts (336 ha), vegetables (204 ha) and fodder (158 ha). Four \nLandsat Enhanced\
    \ Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images ac- \nquired during the 2001 and 2002 seasons\
    \ were used to analyze \nthe temporal and spatial distributions of ET in the study\
    \ area. \nThe images, selected coincidentally with the PP initiated in \nAbdel\
    \ Hakam, were dated 6 September 2001, 11 December \n2001, 25 September 2002 and\
    \ 28 November 2002. \n \n2.2. The SEBAL Model \nSurface energy balance used for\
    \ remote sensing-based ET \nestimations is proving to be the most recently accepted\
    \ techni- \nque for aerial ET estimation (Morse et al., 2000). SEBAL is \none\
    \ of such models utilizing Landsat and images from other \nsensors with a thermal\
    \ infrared band to solve the energy balan- \nce equation and, consequently, to\
    \ generate an aerial map of \nET (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998a, b; Morse et al.,\
    \ 2000). \nSEBAL requires weather data such as solar radiation, wind \nspeed,\
    \ precipitation, air temperature and relative humidity in \naddition to satellite\
    \ images with visible, near infrared and ther- \nmal bands. In the absence of\
    \ horizontally advective energy, the \nsurface energy balance of the land surface\
    \ can be expressed as: \n \nG\nH\nRn\nE\n\n\n\n\n                        \
    \          (1) \n \nwhere λE is latent heat flux, Rn is net radiation at the surface,\
    \ \nH is sensible heat flux, and G is soil heat flux. All fluxes are \nexpressed\
    \ in W/m2. \nNet radiation is the algebraic sum of the shortwave and \nlong-wave\
    \ radiative fluxes and is computed as: \n \n\n\n\nout \nin\ns\nL\nL\nR\nRn\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n                         (2) \n \nwhere  is surface albedo;\
    \ Rs is solar radiation (W/m2); ε is \nland surface emissivity; and Lin and Lout\
    \ are incoming and out- \ngoing long-wave radiation (W/m2). The  was determined\
    \ by \nintegrating spectral reflectance in the six shortwave bands of \nthe Landsat\
    \ images, and Lin and Lout were computed as func- \ntions of surface temperature\
    \ derived from the satellite images. \nThe ε was computed from Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation \nIndex (NDVI) derived from two of the shortwave bands (red and \n\
    near-infrared) as explained by Van de Griend & Owe (1993): \n \n\n\n1.009\n\

    \ radiation Lout is determined by \nStefan-Boltzman’s law (σ = 5.67 × 10-8) as\
    \ a function of sur- \nface temperature (Ts) and surface emissivity (εo), while\
    \ inco- \nming long-wave radiation Lin was determined from the air tem- \nperature\
    \ (Ta) and atmospheric emissivity (εa). The complete set \nof equations is explained\

    \ a surface and a level z was evaluated us- \ning a bulk resistance approach.\
    \ Sensible heat flux, aerodyna- \nmic resistance and friction velocity were estimated\

    \ and Von Kar- \nman’s constant, respectively. The mean value of Ts and Ta re-\
    \ \npresents the air temperature of the layer between zoh and z. \nThe roughness\
    \ length for heat zoh was set to 0.1zom. The rou- \nghness for momentum was deduced\

    \n         \n          (14) \n \nwhere a and b are constants calibrated for each\
    \ image. \nOnce the instantaneous λE flux is computed from Equa- \ntion (1), then\
    \ the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the entire \nday (24 hours) of the image\
    \ dates is calculated by first deter- \nmining the evaporative fraction (Λ) and\
    \ the daily net radiation \n(Rn24hour). The 24-hour net radiation was computed\
    \ according \nto De Bruin (1987), while the evaporative fraction was com- \nputed\
    \ according to Equation (15). Experimental evidence in- \ndicates that Λ is a\
    \ constant during cloud-free days (Nichols and \nCuenca, 1993) and that there\
    \ is little difference between mid- \nday Λ and the all-day average (Shuttleworth\
    \ et al., 1989). Van \nOevelen et al. (1993) and Kustas et al. (1994) showed that\
    \ Λ \nis an adequate tool for describing the surface energy partition- \ning for\
    \ time scales of one day or less and daily integrated va- \nlues of (Rn – G) using\

    \ from W.m-2 to mm per day by the surface temperature \ndependent latent heat\
    \ of vaporization (Equation 16) as follows: \n \n7\n24\n8.64\n10\na\nhour\nET\n\

    seasons since these years coincided with the experimental re- \nsults of ETa obtained\

    \ \nwater balance equation can be simplified as \nS\nI\nP\n\n\n\n  \na\nET\
    \ . \nConsequently, daily ETa for each irrigation cycle was cal- \nculated from\
    \ differences of volumetric soil moisture content \naccording to Equation (18):\

    \ evapotranspiration during the irrigation \ncycle (mm/d); p is the effective\
    \ rainfall (mm) between the post- \nand preirrigation gravimetric sampling; n\
    \ is the number of soil \nlayers from which soil samples were taken; θ1i and θ2i\
    \ are the \nvolumetric soil moisture content during the post and pre- \nirrigation\
    \ cycles, respectively, for the soil layer i; ∆t is the \ntime elapsed between\
    \ θ1i and θ2i (days); and ∆zi is the thick- \nness of each soil layer sampled\
    \ (mm). The gravimetric mois- \nture content (w/w) was converted to volumetric\
    \ values (v/v) \nby multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by the dry \n\
    bulk density, according to Equation (19): \n \ng\nBD\n\n \n\n            \

    \ of the soil (%) \nand BD the soil layer’s bulk density. The data of soil volume\
    \ \nweight ratios introduced by Abdine and Farbrother (1969) were \nused to generate\
    \ regression equations that relate soil bulk den- \nsity to soil depth and moisture\
    \ content. The second degree po- \nlynomial equations were used in the regression\
    \ for depths of 0 \nto 60 cm, while linear regression was used for depths of 60\
    \ to \n100 cm. The generated regression equations were used to trans- \nform the\
    \ gravimetric moisture content to volumetric values \n(Abdelhadi et al., 2006).\

    \ daily ET \nas estimated by SEBAL over the entire study area on four Ju- \nlian\

    \ from 0 to 6, 0.01 to 7.8, 0.2 to 5.7 and 0 to 9 mm/d, \nrespectively (Figure\
    \ 2). It is clear from Figure 3 that the Sep- \ntember images have similar histograms\
    \ with two peaks, the first \none (less than 2 mm/d) represents the fallow lands,\
    \ while the \nsecond (more than 4 mm/d) represents the sorghum fields. The \n\
    ETa values for cotton during 6 September and 25 September \nranged from 1.2 to\
    \ 5.0 mm/d and 2.8 to 5.0 mm/d, respective- \nly (Table 2). \n \n \nFigure 3.\

    \ block during \nNovember. \n \nThe assessment of the spatial distribution of\
    \ ETa by \nSEBAL allowed the estimation of water use for the irrigation \nsystem\
    \ at different minor canals of the study area. Table 3 \nshows the water demand\
    \ for different crops grown at each \nminor canal. For example, water consumption\
    \ values for the \nTereifi minor canal during 6 September, 25 September, 28 \n\
    November and 11 December were 10,282, 11,383, 15,667 and \n15,626 m3, respectively,\
    \ representing critical information and \nkey factors for irrigation water management.\
    \ Daily water de- \nmand for all minor canals during November which represents\
    \ a \ntransition month with areas still having summer crops such as \nsorghum\
    \ and cotton and new areas beginning to have winter \ncrops such as wheat and\
    \ some vegetables is shown in Figure 4. \nDaily demand ranges from 15,667 m3 for\
    \ Tereifi to 28,954 m3 \nfor Heleiwa west. Satellite remote sensing provides a\
    \ tool to \nestimate crop acreage and net irrigation water requirements at \n\
    canal level for each crop season. Thus the objective of effi- \ncient and sustainable\
    \ water management can be achieved by \noptimal linkage between water available\
    \ and water demand. \nKnowing the water supply needed in all minor canals is \n\
    requisite for computing water demand in all majors, and the \nneeds of all majors\
    \ are added up to compute the supply need- \ned into the main canals. The demand\
    \ thus estimated is suppli- \ned from the dam to satisfy the demand set for each\
    \ minor and \nmajor canal. To extrapolate daily values to monthly and sea- \n\
    sonal ET, the processing of several images taken during the \ngrowing season is\
    \ requisite, as is a means of integrating daily \nET into seasonal values. \n\

    \ by SEBAL, \nPM reference ET and crop evapotranspiration (ETc = E0kf). \nThe\
    \ calculated ETc values were related to the original Penman \nevaporation from\
    \ free water surfaces by crop factor (kf). The \ndifferences between estimated\
    \ ETc and SEBAL ET values pre- \ndicted on JDs 6 September, 11 December, 25 September\
    \ and \n28 November were 10%, 8.5%, 12.5% and 9.7%, respectively. \nThe average\
    \ low difference indicated that the crop was not \nsubjected to water stress during\
    \ its growing cycle. The actual \nET from SEBAL was lower than reference crop\
    \ ET based on \nPenman-Monteith (ET0-PM) during September, corresponding \nto\
    \ the expectaions during the September cotton crop and to \nthe early stages of\
    \ low evapotranspiration. During late Novem- \nber and early December, however,\
    \ the actual ET values from \nSEBAL were higher than those from ET0-PM, corresponding\
    \ \nto the maximum growth stages of cotton when larger quanti- \nties of water\
    \ were required. \nFigure 5 demonstrates a comparison between SEBAL va- \nlues\
    \ and the actual field measurements obtained by the water \nbalance method. The\
    \ moisture content of the soil was regular- \nly monitored by gravimetric sampling\
    \ before and after each ir- \nrigation cycle, down to a depth of 100 cm. All gravimetric\
    \ sam- \nples were dried at 105 ºC for 24 h, and routine weather data \nfrom the\
    \ Gezira Meteorological Station (GMS) were taken in- \nto account. \nThe ETa values\
    \ estimated for sorghum by SEBAL on the \nfour satellite dates 6 September, 11\
    \ December, 25 September \nand 28 November were 4.7, 2.4, 4.4, and 3 mm/d, respectively.\
    \ \nThe actual ET values measured using WB on 6 September, 25 \nSeptember and\
    \ 28 November were 5.3, 4.6 and 3.8 mm/d, \nrespectively; ET for 11 December was\
    \ not measured because \nof the unavailability of gravimetric data. The absolute\
    \ error be- \ntween the estimated values by SEBAL and the measured va- \nlues\
    \ by WB on the three JDs was 0.6, 0.2 and 0.8 mm/d, re- \nspectively. The good\
    \ agreement between SEBAL and WB me- \nthod in this study confirms other studies\
    \ (Bashir et al., 2007) \nand indicates the potential of SEBAL in Gezira irrigated\

    \ were \n3.6, 6.4, 4.2 and 6.5 mm/d, respectively, whereas the corres- \nponding\

    \ estimated to be \naround 0.7 mm/d, denoting reliable agreement between the \n\
    actual ET measurements and ET estimated by SEBAL for most \nof the images of both\
    \ sorghum and cotton. \nThe close relation between the two values verified that\
    \ \nthe crops were well supplied by water and reflected the high \nyields of all\
    \ the crops grown in the Abdel Hakam block com- \npared with the average in the\
    \ Gezira scheme (Table 5). In a \nstudy on the impact of the PP on crop productivity,\
    \ Abdelhadi \net al. (2004) compared the PP (Abdel Hakam block) with the \nfour\
    \ neighboring blocks, demonstrating that average increase \nin cotton yield ranged\
    \ from 3% to 45% in the first season and \n14% to 64% in the second season, whereas\

    \ / Journal of Environmental Informatics 13(2) 86-92 (2009) \n \n92 \nFrom the\
    \ 2001 and 2002 seasons, SEBAL results clearly \nshowed that farmers were able\
    \ to deliver sufficient amounts of \nwater to their fields, unlike previous seasons\
    \ (before the PP). \nThe primary reason for this positive change was probably\
    \ due \nto the activities carried out by farmers before each season such \nas\
    \ maintenance of canal banks, replacement of field outlet pi- \npes, erection\
    \ of new field outlet gates, and maintenance and \nerection of intermediate regulators.\
    \ It is also clear that the trans- \nfer of the irrigation management authority\
    \ to local irrigation \ncommittees chieved the objective of curtailing irrigation\
    \ const \nand making irrigation management financially self-sustaining. \n4. Conclusions\
    \ \nIn this study, multidate ETM+ images and energy balance \nmodel were used\
    \ to evaluate a PP in Abdel Hakam block sup- \nported by the FAO during 2000 ~\
    \ 2002. A comparison between \nSEBAL and actual measurements or conventional methods\
    \ ba- \nsed on meteorological data showed plausible agreement, indi- \ncating\
    \ that sorghum and cotton in these seasons (2001 and \n2002) were not subjected\
    \ to any kind of water stress. The dai- \nly values of water demand at different\
    \ minor canals were suc- \ncessfully estimated. Relative irrigation supply indicated\
    \ impro- \nvements in operational performance of irrigation during the pe- \n\
    riod of the PP. Results revealed that the yields of major crops \nhave increased\
    \ significantly in Abdel Hakam block compared \nwith the neighboring blocks as\
    \ well as the scheme average. \nThe PP supported by the FAO proved that the participatory\
    \ \nwater management approach can be successfully implemented \nto change the\
    \ attitudes of farmers towards water management \nissues. The results of this\
    \ temporal assessment are useful and \nencouragement to convince the donors to\
    \ repeat the PP in se- \nveral blocks of the Gezira scheme. \n \nReferences \n\

    \ interactions in the Republic River basin (RRB)\nin the midwestern United States,\
    \ where agriculture heavily\ndepends on irrigation. The decreasing ﬂow trend recorded\
    \ at\nthe RRB gauging station since the 1950s reﬂects the syn-\nthetical effect\
    \ of dynamic interactions between surface wa-\nter and groundwater systems, which\
    \ has been enhanced by\ngroundwater pumping and irrigation return ﬂow. This study\n\
    uses a systematic modeling approach to analyze the conjunc-\ntive effects of pumping\
    \ and return ﬂow on streamﬂow. A wa-\ntershed management model, the Soil and Water\
    \ Assessment\nTool (SWAT), is modiﬁed and established for the French-\nman Creek\
    \ basin (FCB), a subbasin of RRB, to examine the\ncauses of streamﬂow changes.\
    \ The baseﬂow component in\nSWAT is linked to aquifer storage so that the model\
    \ can sim-\nulate the combined effects of groundwater pumping and ir-\nrigation\
    \ return ﬂow on natural streamﬂow. Results show that\nirrigation has not only\
    \ depleted streamﬂow but also changed\nthe ﬂow pattern and seasonal variability.\
    \ The changes can be\ndecomposed into decrease in the slow component (baseﬂow)\n\
    and increase in the fast components (surface and subsurface\nﬂow). Since the fast\
    \ components are subject to higher vari-\nability than the slow component, the\
    \ annual streamﬂow vari-\nability is ampliﬁed. Agricultural water use in this\
    \ region also\nhas changed the groundwater storage seasonal regime from\nthe pattern\
    \ of “summer recharge and winter discharge” in the\npast to “summer discharge\
    \ and winter recharge” at present.\nThis challenges the existing groundwater modeling,\
    \ which\nusually assumes ﬁxed recharge pattern and rates.\n1\nIntroduction\nIrrigation\
    \ has contributed to the agricultural production in-\ncrease during the past decades,\
    \ becoming the largest wa-\nter consumption sector throughout the world, accounting\
    \ for\nabout 70 % of the global freshwater withdrawals and 90 % of\nconsumptive\
    \ water uses (Siebert et al., 2010). In the United\nStates, irrigation is located\
    \ in the states where average an-\nnual precipitation is typically less than 20\
    \ inches and thereby\nis insufﬁcient for crop consumption. As the surface water\n\
    resources is prone to be affected by climate variability and\npollution, and needs\
    \ infrastructure investment for storage\n(i.e., reservoir) and delivery (i.e.,\
    \ channels), groundwater has\nreplaced surface water as the major water source\
    \ in many\nplaces. In 2005, 13 western states consumed nearly 90 % of\nthe groundwater\
    \ used for irrigation, among which ground-\nwater was the primary source for irrigation\
    \ in Nebraska,\nArkansas, Texas, Kansas, Mississippi, and Missouri (Kenny\net\
    \ al., 2009).\nGroundwater-fed irrigation alters hydrological processes\nacross\
    \ a range of scales. The estimated global groundwater\ndepletion since the year\
    \ of 1900 is equivalent to a 12.6 mm\nrise in sea level, which accounts for more\
    \ than 6 % of to-\ntal sea-level rise (Konikow, 2011). Nonrenewable groundwa-\n\
    ter abstraction contributes approximately 20 % to the global\ngross irrigation\
    \ water demand in the year of 2000 (Wada et\nal., 2012). At the regional scale,\
    \ the rapid development of\ngroundwater pumping after the 1950s has changed the\
    \ in-\nteractions of surface water and groundwater and caused wa-\nter right conﬂicts\
    \ between surface water users and ground-\nwater users in the western states of\
    \ the US (Sophocleous,\n2010; Gleeson et al., 2012). At a local scale, the changes\n\

    \ ﬂux affect the terrestrial envi-\nronment and ﬂuvial biota (Alley et al., 2002).\
    \ The interac-\ntions between groundwater and lakes, wetlands, estuaries,\nand\
    \ oceans play an important role for the distribution of biota\nand biogeochemical\
    \ processes, such as ﬁsh spawning areas\n(Malcolm et al., 2008).\nMoreover, the\
    \ aggregation of the disruption of the local\nhydrological cycle by intensive\
    \ irrigation has been found to\naffect the regional climate, which would further\
    \ affect the\nirrigation requirement, leading to a feedback loop. Irrigation\n\
    impacts land surface processes by altering the partition of en-\nergy and water\
    \ through the interactions between soil proﬁle,\nland surface ﬂux and groundwater\
    \ depth. Studies have shown\nthat irrigation increases surface latent heat ﬂux\
    \ and dew point\ntemperature, while decreases sensible heat ﬂux and near-\nground\
    \ temperature (Adegoke et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2007).\nDeAngelis et al. (2010)\
    \ found the intensive groundwater\npumping for agricultural use over the Great\
    \ Plains leads\nto increased vapor, which aggregates to enhance downwind\nprecipitation.\
    \ According to Ferguson and Maxwell (2012),\nthe effect of water management (e.g.,\
    \ pumping and irriga-\ntion) on terrestrial water and energy budgets is even com-\n\
    parable in magnitude to the impact of climate change (e.g.,\nchanges in temperature\
    \ and precipitation). Thus, understand-\ning the details of how irrigation affects\
    \ hydrological pro-\ncesses will help in understanding hydrological alterations\n\
    over watershed scales, as well as providing support for con-\njunctive management\
    \ of surface water and groundwater re-\nsources in terms of satisfying both human\
    \ and environmental\nwater needs.\nWhile the complex feedbacks between irrigation\
    \ and land\nsurface processes have been less studied because of difﬁcul-\nties\
    \ in observation data, the impact of large-scale pumping\non aquifer storage and\
    \ streamﬂow is more likely to be ob-\nserved (McGuire, 2009) and hence has been\
    \ studied inten-\nsively since Theis (1940). Jenkins (1968) analyzed the stream\n\
    depletion volume and residual timing of pumping by intro-\nducing the SDF (stream\
    \ depletion factor), which measures\nhow fast groundwater withdrawal transfers\
    \ from aquifer stor-\nage to stream depletion, to account for the transient effect\n\
    of pumping. Kendy and Bredehoeft (2006) assessed the re-\nsponse of streamﬂow\
    \ to pumping wells with different dis-\ntances to the river. They found that stream\
    \ depletion caused\nby near-stream pumping wells quickly reaches equilibrium\n\
    and responses temporally in phase with pumping; however,\nfar-away wells cause\
    \ smaller stream depletion and seasonal\nﬂuctuation, and a greater portion of\
    \ the depletion occurs dur-\ning post-irrigation season. They also examined the\
    \ impact of\nirrigation efﬁciency on the streamﬂow seasonality and found\nthat\
    \ when the irrigation system delivers water inefﬁciently,\nirrigation return ﬂow\
    \ recharges the aquifer during irrigation\nseason and discharges to stream during\
    \ post-irrigation sea-\nson, boosting fall and winter low ﬂows. The return ﬂow\
    \ to\nstream is a loss of irrigation water but a gain of streamﬂow in\nmany cases.\
    \ For example, Gosain et al. (2005) studied return\nﬂow from irrigation introduced\
    \ by canal in the Palleru River\nbasin. They found that return ﬂow accounts for\
    \ over 50 %\nof irrigation application, much higher than the usual rule-of-\n\
    thumb value of 10–20 %. However, in many studies, return\nﬂow is simply accounted\
    \ as a ﬁxed portion of irrigation wa-\nter application and is added back to streamﬂow.\
    \ This will\nprobably ignore the actual quantity and temporal variation of\nthe\
    \ return ﬂow contribution to streamﬂow, which might be\ninﬂuential during growing\
    \ seasons.\nThe combined effects of the two processes, pumping and\nreturn ﬂow,\
    \ on streamﬂow have not been well represented\nby the models used for the analysis.\
    \ Few current groundwa-\nter models explicitly simulate the impact of irrigation\
    \ return\nﬂow on aquifer–stream interaction; while surface hydrologi-\ncal models\
    \ usually do not simulate the impact of groundwater\npumping on baseﬂow appropriately.\
    \ Both modeling groups\ncapture one aspect of the picture, but not the whole.\
    \ For ex-\nample, the aquifer recharge, evapotranspiration and channel\nloss in\
    \ groundwater models are usually decided through cal-\nibration and treated as\
    \ ﬁxed values during the simulation pe-\nriod. Attempts to simulate crop processes,\
    \ such as with the\nFarm Process package of MODFLOW, improve the estimate\nof\
    \ crop water requirement (Schmid et al., 2006). However,\nthose models usually\
    \ do not simulate the soil proﬁle, which\nplays an important role in determining\
    \ crop growth, recharge\nand evapotranspiration (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999).\
    \ Some\nsurface hydrological models have detailed representations\nof crop irrigation\
    \ requirement and soil moisture, but usu-\nally assume that groundwater-fed irrigation\
    \ has no impact on\nthe source (i.e., aquifer storage) (Sophocleous and Perkins,\n\
    2000). It is important to note irrigation affects spatially dis-\ntributed hydrological\
    \ processes and land-energy ﬂuxes de-\npending on the location of irrigated crops\
    \ (Ferguson and\nMaxwell, 2011). The streamﬂow recorded at gauging stations\n\
    is the result of dynamic interactions between surface water\nand groundwater systems\
    \ over different temporal and spa-\ntial scales, where return ﬂow plays a critical\
    \ role in partially\ncompensating the stream depletion caused by groundwater\n\
    pumping and changing the process of streamﬂow response to\nclimatic variability\
    \ through the conjunctive management of\nsurface water and groundwater systems.\n\
    Although hydrological research communities agree that\nsurface water and groundwater\
    \ systems compose a holistic\nentity that requires an integrated modeling approach,\
    \ models\nfor the integrated systems are currently not well developed\n(Sophocleous\
    \ and Perkins, 2000; Sophocleous, 2010). In this\nstudy, the Soil and Water Assessment\
    \ Tool (SWAT) (Arnold\net al., 1998), a widely used watershed management model\
    \ is\nmodiﬁed by linking the baseﬂow component to aquifer stor-\nage in order\
    \ to simulate the complex effect of groundwater\npumping and irrigation return\
    \ ﬂow on streamﬂow, and to un-\nderstand the impact of irrigated agricultural\
    \ development on\nstreamﬂow change. The model is applied to the Frenchman\nCreek\
    \ basin (FCB), a subbasin of the Republican River basin\n(RRB), where groundwater-fed\
    \ irrigation has been developed\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 493–502, 2014\n\

    water use in this region.\nin the area since the 1950s and considerable streamﬂow\
    \ de-\npletion has been reported (Burt et al., 2002). This case study\nwill then\

    \ under the effects of pumping and\nreturn ﬂow.\n2\nStudy area and model description\n\
    2.1\nFrenchman Creek basin\nThe RRB, lying above the northern Ogallala Aquifer,\
    \ is\nshared by Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. The FCB, a sub-\nbasin of RRB,\
    \ lays above the Ogallala Formation, which is\ncomposed mainly of silt, sand,\
    \ gravel, and clay-rock debris\nthat have been washed off the face of the Rocky\
    \ Mountains\nand other more local sources over the past several million\nyears\
    \ (Gutentag, 1984). Recharge to the High Plains aquifer\nis primarily fed by precipitation\
    \ through inﬁltration. Natu-\nral discharge from the High Plains aquifer goes\
    \ to springs,\nseeps, and streams, as well as by evapotranspiration ﬂux.\nHowever,\
    \ the pumping for irrigated crops now becomes a sig-\nniﬁcant discharge from the\
    \ aquifer. The Ogallala Formation\nhas the greatest saturated thickness, and the\
    \ portion in FCB\nranges from 200 to 300 ft. above the Permian bedrock (Miller\n\
    et al., 1997). The aquifer underlying the FCB is conceptu-\nalized as a one-layer\
    \ unconﬁned aquifer above a non-leaky\nbedrock in the groundwater model established\
    \ by the Repub-\nlican River Compact Administration (RRCA). Groundwater-\nfed\
    \ irrigation since the 1950s (shown in Fig. 1 as the pump-\ning well numbers)\
    \ in this region has reduced aquifer storage\nand caused stream depletion problems\
    \ in the RRB as shown\nin Fig. 2. Groundwater storage in the High Plains aquifer\n\
    in 2009 was about 2.9 billion acre-ft., showing a decline of\nabout 274 million\
    \ acre-ft. (or about 9 %) from predevelop-\nment storage (McGuire, 2011). Szilagyi\
    \ (2001) found the\nFig. 2. Monthly ﬂow regime (monthly average ﬂow by each decade)\n\
    at RRB outlet (source: USGS Station 06853500).\nRepublican River annual streamﬂow\
    \ has declined by 61 %\nwithout a signiﬁcant change in climate. Disputes about\
    \ sur-\nface water and groundwater rights lead to a legal issue among\nthe states\
    \ sharing the aquifer.\nThe Frenchman Creek, about 166 mi. long, ﬂows from\nColorado\
    \ to Nebraska. The average annual precipitation in\nthis region from 1941 to 1994\
    \ was about 443 mm according\nto the Automated Weather Data Network with the High\
    \ Plain\nRegional Climate Center (HPRCC, 2010), which increases\nfrom east to\
    \ west as the effect of elevation gradient; annual\npotential evapotranspiration\
    \ in this region is about 1100 mm.\nThe crop in the basin is heavily dependent\
    \ on central pivot ir-\nrigation from pumping wells. Although lacking of well\
    \ doc-\numented groundwater consumptive use data, studies have\nshown a strong\
    \ statistical relationship between the number of\npumping wells and stream depletion\
    \ in this watershed (Burt\net al., 2002). In this study, the pumping is estimated\
    \ from\nannual irrigated crop acreage from the National Agricultural\nStatistics\
    \ Service (USDA, 1999). The FCB has experienced\nstream depletion over the past\
    \ decades. The majority of the\nﬂow in the watershed was sustained by the Ogallala\
    \ Aquifer\nsystem. The perennial drainage section of the headwater,\nonce located\
    \ several miles west of the Nebraska–Colorado\nborder, now shrinks downstream\
    \ by several miles east of the\nborder.\nIt is widely accepted that streamﬂow\
    \ decreases in the\nRRB have been caused by extensive pumping, but the de-\ncreases\
    \ can also be related to climate change. We ﬁrst ex-\namine the climate during\
    \ the last decades to ﬁnd out if the\nclimate can also explain the streamﬂow changes.\
    \ We divide\nthe climate time series into two equal lengths (pre- and post-\n\
    1970). The spatially averaged annual precipitation and tem-\nperature since the\
    \ 1940s are shown in Fig. 4, respectively.\nThe annual precipitation exhibits\
    \ ﬂuctuation ranging from\n300 to 600 mm. The mean annual precipitation is 452\

    \ for pre-1970 and post-1970, respectively, and the\nstandard deviation remain\
    \ unchanged at around 95 mm. The\nannual average minimum temperature slightly\
    \ increases from\n1.96 to 2.13 ◦C; the annual average maximum temperature\nslightly\
    \ decreases from 18.07 to 17.92 ◦C. Standard devia-\ntion of the both remain unchanged\
    \ at around 0.7 ◦C. More-\nover, the seasonality of climatic variables was examined\
    \ by\naveraging the monthly data for each decade; it is found that\nthe pattern\
    \ remains unchanged, i.e., the rainfall season is still\nin phase with the warm\
    \ season. Actually, a slight decrease is\nfound in the diurnal temperature range\
    \ (difference between\ndaily maximum and minimum temperature), which can be\n\
    the result of irrigation. Irrigation leads to increased evapo-\ntranspiration\
    \ and humidity above farmland, converting more\nradiative energy into latent heat,\
    \ which results in redistribu-\ntion of surface energy between latent heat, sensible\
    \ heat and\nground heat ﬂux. Adegoke et al. (2003) compared the surface\nenergy\
    \ budget between irrigated and non-irrigated farmland\nin Nebraska. They found\
    \ that due to the “cooling effect”, ir-\nrigation contributes to a 15 % decrease\
    \ in sensible heat and\n1.2 ◦C decrease in near-ground temperature. Thus, based\
    \ on\nthe observed data and some relevant analyses, changes in\nclimate forcing\
    \ cannot explain the signiﬁcant decrease in\nstreamﬂow, which is then mostly likely\
    \ due to other factors\nsuch as land use and water use in the region.\n2.2\nWatershed\
    \ management model\nSWAT, a semi-distributed, physically based watershed\nmodel,\
    \ includes components such as weather, hydrology,\nsediment transport, crop growth,\
    \ water quality, and agricul-\ntural management, and has been widely applied to\
    \ assessing\nwater quantity and quality, land use and climate change im-\npacts,\
    \ and agriculture management in heterogeneous water-\nsheds (Gassman et al., 2007).\
    \ Irrigation is simulated by an\nauto-irrigation subroutine, i.e., irrigation\
    \ is applied when the\nsoil moisture of a crop ﬁeld is below the prescribed irrigation\n\
    triggering threshold during the crop growing season.\nFig. 4. Annual precipitation\
    \ (left) and maximum/mininimum tem-\nperature (right) in FCB. The climate exhibits\
    \ no signiﬁcant change\nduring the last several decades. The slight decrease in\
    \ diurnal tem-\nperature range implies the impact of irrigation on land surface\
    \ en-\nergy redistribution.\nIn watersheds with intensive irrigation, irrigation\
    \ return\nﬂow is an important human-induced hydrologic process, but\nit is usually\
    \ ignored or oversimpliﬁed in some existing agri-\ncultural watershed models.\
    \ Irrigation return ﬂow includes\nboth a vertical and a horizontal component.\
    \ The vertical\ncomponent inﬁltrates through the soil proﬁle and recharge\naquifer,\
    \ which will then affect aquifer storage and further\nbaseﬂow. The horizontal\
    \ component moves in the soil pro-\nﬁle and contributes to rivers as subsurface\
    \ ﬂow. The differ-\nent return ﬂow paths result in different processes and travel\n\
    times. Moreover, irrigation changes soil moisture, and in turn\nthe soil moisture\
    \ dynamics affects the timing and quantity\nof irrigation return ﬂow. SWAT simulates\
    \ runoff from sur-\nface ﬂow, subsurface ﬂow and baseﬂow, separately. Thus the\n\
    SWAT model is chosen to simulate the effect of irrigation re-\nturn ﬂow on all\
    \ components of runoff, i.e., the baseﬂow and\nthe fast ﬂow components.\nHydrol.\

    R. Zeng and X. Cai: Analyzing streamﬂow changes\n497\nIn the SWAT model the baseﬂow\
    \ is calculated by the fol-\nlowing equation:\nQgw,i = Qgw,i−1Exp(−α1t) + Wrchrg,i[1\
    \ − Exp(−α1t)], (1)\nwhere i is the simulation day, 1t is the time step (i.e.,\
    \ one\nday), Qgw,i is the baseﬂow, Wrchrg is the shallow aquifer\nrecharge from\
    \ soil proﬁle, and α is the baseﬂow recession\ncoefﬁcient. In Eq. (1), baseﬂow\
    \ depends on the baseﬂow\nfrom the previous day (representing recession process)\
    \ and\nrecharge (representing the effect of rain-induced recharge\non baseﬂow).\
    \ However, the process reﬂecting the impact of\ngroundwater pumping on streamﬂow\
    \ is missing in Eq. (1).\nGroundwater pumping ﬁrst captures aquifer storage, if\
    \ the\nstorage is not fully recovered, then the induced water table\ngradient\
    \ would change the discharge (i.e., baseﬂow), causing\nstream depletion. To represent\
    \ this process, alternatively, the\nbaseﬂow component in SWAT has been modiﬁed\
    \ based on\nthe shallow (unconﬁned) aquifer water storage (Ssh):\nQgw,i = α Ssh,i,\n\
    (2)\nand storage is updated through shallow aquifer water bal-\nance:\nSsh,i =\
    \ Ssh,i−1 + Wrchrg,i − Qgw,i − Wrevap,i − Wpump,i,\n(3)\nwhere Wrevap is the water\
    \ evapotranspirated from the shallow\naquifer by deep root vegetation; Wpump is\
    \ the water pumped\nfrom aquifer for irrigation use, which is based on the soil\n\
    moisture content. Note that Eq. (2) represents a linear stor-\nage model (Chow\
    \ et al., 1988). If there is no recharge, i.e.,\nevapotranspiration and pumping,\
    \ baseﬂow is an ordinary dif-\nferential equation and Eq. (1), originally used\
    \ in SWAT, can\nbe derived from Eqs. (2) and (3). Thus the baseﬂow recession\n\
    parameter is consistently used in the original and modiﬁed\nmodel. However, the\
    \ modiﬁed equation requires one more\nparameter, the initial storage, which needs\
    \ to be calibrated\nfrom model outputs. Note that Eq. (3) assumes groundwater\n\
    lateral ﬂux is negligible in the water balance equation. This\nassumption is validated\
    \ by checking the water table contour\nin the study area. The water table contour\
    \ in 1979 and 1995\nare obtained from the Conservation and Survey Division\nin\
    \ the University of Nebraska (Swinehart and Richmond,\n1994). Those contours show\
    \ that the groundwater in FCB\nﬂows from west to east following the topographic\
    \ gradient.\nSince the water table contour is generally perpendicular to\nthe\
    \ boundary of the FCB within Nebraska, the groundwater\nlateral ﬂow exchange with\
    \ the adjacent aquifer is negligible.\nThe irrigated cropland acreage over years\
    \ is an important\nmodel input, which determines the timing and location of\n\
    groundwater pumping for irrigation. Since irrigation is the\nmajor water use in\
    \ this watershed, the spatial and temporal\nexpansion of irrigated crop water\
    \ use affects the spatial het-\nerogeneity and temporal variability of groundwater\
    \ storage\nchange through pumping, which further affects the interac-\ntion between\
    \ surface and ground water, especially the con-\ntribution of baseﬂow to river\
    \ streams. Running the SWAT\nmodel over years will capture the temporal variability\
    \ of\ngroundwater storage and then streamﬂow; the spatial vari-\nability of groundwater\
    \ storage, baseﬂow and the total stream-\nﬂow is related to the spatial distribution\
    \ of irrigation pumping\nover the spatial units of the SWAT model (i.e., hydrologic\
    \ re-\nsponse units represented by watersheds of a certain stream\norder).\nTo\
    \ calibrate the model for the FCB, the outlet of the water-\nshed is chosen at\
    \ the upstream of Enders Reservoir (USGS\nsiteID 06831500) to exclude the impacts\
    \ of surface water\nregulation on streamﬂow. The model is calibrated and val-\n\
    idated for the periods 1981–1985 and 1986–1990, respec-\ntively, with a multiple-objective\
    \ genetic algorithm. The root-\nmean-square error (RMSE) and logarithm of the\
    \ RMSE of\nstreamﬂow are chosen as calibration criteria to consider both\nhigh\
    \ ﬂow and low ﬂow. The SWAT model is calibrated by the\ntotal streamﬂow (i.e.,\
    \ including both baseﬂow from aquifer\ndischarge and surface runoff). The RMSE\
    \ of crop yield is\nalso set as criteria, mainly to calibrate the auto-irrigation\n\
    trigger parameter, thus the water management activity (i.e.,\npumping amount and\
    \ timing) is retrieved through ﬂow and\ncrop data. It is worth noting that the\
    \ best calibration result of\nthe original SWAT model does not even capture the\
    \ stream\ndecline trend. For details on model data, parameters, and cal-\nibration\
    \ procedures, the reader is referred to Zeng (2012).\n3\nResults\n3.1\nStreamﬂow\
    \ change due to land use and pumping\nThe SWAT model is applied to three land\
    \ use and water\nmanagement scenarios, all under historical climate forcing\n\
    data: (1) no agricultural development in this region; (2) land\nuse change is\
    \ represented by historical crop area but no ir-\nrigation (i.e., rain-fed crop);\
    \ (3) historical crop area with\ngroundwater pumping simulated by auto-irrigation\
    \ in SWAT.\nThe auto-irrigation module of SWAT calibrated to the case\nstudy watershed\
    \ is used to determine the irrigation schedul-\ning, including the water application\
    \ timing and amount. By\ncomparing the results from these scenarios, the impacts\
    \ of\nland use and groundwater irrigation can be identiﬁed.\nIn the “no agricultural\
    \ development” scenario, the land use\nis ﬁxed as the level in the 1940s, when\
    \ most of the land\ncover in the region was either grassland or ranch land and\n\
    only a small fraction of the land was used for irrigated agri-\nculture, which\
    \ is negligible compared to the large irrigation\nwater consumption after quick\
    \ development in the 1960s and\n1970s. Under this “natural” scenario, the mean\
    \ streamﬂow is\n3.24 and 3.08 m3 s−1 during pre-1970s and post-1970s peri-\nods,\
    \ respectively, showing a very small change. This small\ndecline may also be caused\
    \ by agricultural activity because\nsome parts of the basin were used for crop\
    \ production before\nthe 1940s.\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/18/493/2014/\n\

    \ streamﬂow changes\nFig. 5. Surface ﬂow (SUR), subsurface ﬂow (SUB) and base-\n\
    ﬂow (GW) for the non-irrigation (left) and irrigation (right) cases.\nGroundwater-fed\
    \ irrigation decreases the slow ﬂow component\n(GW) and increases fast ﬂow components\
    \ (SUR and SUB), leading\nto a streamﬂow more subjected to climate variability.\
    \ The conver-\nsion from natural grassland to irrigated cropland leads to a decrease\n\
    of slow components, due to depletion of aquifer discharge by pump-\ning. The increased\
    \ soil moisture during growing season increases\nsubsurface lateral ﬂow and surface\
    \ runoff during storm events.\nThe streamﬂow under agricultural development is\
    \ shown\nin Fig. 5 with only land use change (non-irrigation sce-\nnario) and\
    \ with both land use change and irrigation (irri-\ngation scenario). For the non-irrigation\
    \ scenario, the mean\nstreamﬂow is 3.22 and 2.77 m3 s−1 during pre-1970s and\n\
    post-1970s periods, respectively. For the irrigation scenario,\nFig. 6. Baseﬂow\
    \ index for non-irrigation and irrigation cases.\nthe mean streamﬂow is 3.05 and\
    \ 1.93 m3 s−1 during pre-\n1970s and post-1970s periods, respectively. Note that\
    \ the\nstreamﬂow from the pre-1970s periods is not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among\
    \ these scenarios, since large-scale agricul-\ntural development and groundwater\
    \ pumping had just started\nat that time. Comparing the ﬂow pre-1970s under the\
    \ three\nscenarios shows that groundwater pumping amounts to a\n0.84 m3 s−1 decrease\
    \ in streamﬂow, more than twice as that\ncaused by land use at 0.31 m3 s−1.\n\
    3.2\nFlow component change\nThe SWAT model simulates three ﬂow components (i.e.,\n\
    baseﬂow, subsurface ﬂow and overland runoff), which en-\nable us to decompose\
    \ the effect of groundwater-fed irriga-\ntion on streamﬂow. In Fig. 5, the surface\
    \ ﬂow, subsurface\nﬂow from the soil proﬁle, and baseﬂow from the aquifer dis-\n\
    charge are denoted as SUR, SUB and GW, respectively. As\nmentioned earlier, streamﬂow\
    \ is decomposed to a slow com-\nponent (corresponding to a sustained baseﬂow from\
    \ aquifer)\nand a fast ﬂow component (corresponding to runoff from\nsurface and\
    \ unsaturated zone), which has a shorter travel\ntime and is more prone to climate\
    \ variability. Although the\nstreamﬂow decreases under both scenarios (land use\
    \ only,\nland use and irrigation), the changes on the different ﬂow\ncomponents\
    \ are signiﬁcantly different. In the non-irrigation\nscenario, all ﬂow components\
    \ decrease, especially for the\nsubsurface ﬂow, which is nearly zero after the\
    \ 1970s. For the\ngroundwater-fed irrigation scenario, the decrease is mainly\n\
    from aquifer discharge (i.e., from 2.56 to 1.41 m3 s−1), while\nsurface ﬂow decreases\
    \ slightly from 0.177 to 0.154 m3 s−1\nand subsurface ﬂow increases from 0.311\
    \ to 0.362 m3 s−1.\nAs a result, return ﬂow from irrigation partially compensates\n\
    the stream depletion by groundwater pumping. This also im-\nplies that ignoring\
    \ irrigation return ﬂow would overestimate\nstream depletion by aquifer pumping.\n\

    \ for non-irrigation and irrigation\ncases.\nAquifer discharge provides streams\
    \ with a stable ﬂow (i.e.,\nslow ﬂow component) and is relatively insensitive\

    \ variability (i.e., temperature, and vapor pressure)\nthrough soil moisture dynamics,\

    \ of baseﬂow in total stream-\nﬂow) is shown in Fig. 6 for irrigation and non-irrigation\

    \ % of the total ﬂow. The\nbaseﬂow indices calculated from a recursive digital\
    \ ﬁlter\n(Santhi et al., 2008) and the US Geological Survey 1 km\nbaseﬂow index\
    \ data set (Wolock, 2003) show similar values\nto our results (i.e., between 69\
    \ and 76 %).\nThe effects of stream depletion and irrigation return ﬂow\nchange\
    \ the ratio of the fast and slow ﬂow components in\nstream, leading to changes\
    \ in streamﬂow variability. The co-\nefﬁcient of variation (CoV) of streamﬂow\
    \ under the irriga-\ntion case is 0.077 and 0.151 for pre- and post-1970s periods,\n\
    respectively. In watersheds with intensive agricultural activ-\nities streamﬂow\
    \ components are affected by crop water con-\nsumption and water management. Thus\
    \ besides climatic vari-\nability, human interference (irrigation, return ﬂow)\
    \ is also an\nimportant factor to affect the stream variability by changing\n\
    the dynamics of surface water and groundwater interaction.\n3.3\nAquifer recharge–discharge\
    \ pattern change\nAssociated with the streamﬂow changes, the pumping for ir-\n\
    rigation and return ﬂow also change the temporal pattern of\naquifer storage.\
    \ The increased soil moisture by irrigation ap-\nplication increases subsurface\
    \ ﬂow. Meanwhile the increased\nsoil moisture also helps recharge the aquifer\
    \ through soil pro-\nFig. 8. Monthly aquifer storage change averaged by decades\

    \ which\nis considerably higher under the irrigation scenario than the\nnon-irrigation\
    \ one. Especially after 1973, the soil proﬁle per-\ncolation is nearly zero in\
    \ the non-irrigation case, since soil\nmoisture in a large portion of the watershed\
    \ is lost to the at-\nmosphere through crop evapotranspiration. While for the\
    \ ir-\nrigated case, irrigation maintains soil moisture and then soil\nproﬁle\
    \ percolation over the years.\nAquifer storage change results from the combined\
    \ effect\nof aquifer recharge, pumping, aquifer discharge to river and\nother\
    \ ﬂuxes (i.e., deep root vegetation evapotranspiration).\nThe monthly aquifer\
    \ storage change regime is averaged by\ndecades, as shown in Fig. 8. During periods\
    \ when irriga-\ntion intensity is low, the aquifer is recharged during sum-\n\
    mer from May to July due to precipitation-dominant recharge\nand discharged in\
    \ winter to sustain the baseﬂow in streams\nsince the precipitation is relatively\
    \ low in winter. Recharge\nto the aquifer in summer from 1920 to 1950 is also\
    \ shown\nby the RRCA groundwater model. With agricultural devel-\nopment, aquifer\
    \ storage experiences signiﬁcant decreases in\nthe crop growth season (June–September,\
    \ which covers the\nwhole summer in the region) due to pumping and high evapo-\n\
    transpiration. However, aquifer storage recovers during win-\nter and spring by\
    \ the return ﬂow, which is delayed from irri-\ngation application in summer. The\
    \ maximum monthly stor-\nage decline occurs in August, when pumping is most in-\n\
    tensive. Figure 9 shows the declining trend of aquifer stor-\nage during the period\
    \ of 1951–1994. Since the SWAT model\ndoes not simulate the water table, the aquifer\
    \ storage is ex-\npressed in equivalent water depth (i.e., millimeter) by averag-\n\
    ing the groundwater storage of all subbasins annually. Since\nlate 1960s, the\
    \ accumulative groundwater storage has de-\nclined about 5500 mm in equivalent\
    \ water depth. The actual\nwater table change can be estimated by dividing the\
    \ aquifer\nstorage change by the speciﬁc yield. The typical value of\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/18/493/2014/\n\

    \ streamﬂow changes\nFig. 9. Accumulative aquifer storage change.\nspeciﬁc yield\
    \ in the area is 0.175 (the value used in the RRCA\nmodel). Thus the average water\
    \ table decrease in the FCB is\nabout 31.5 m, which is validated by the area-weighted\
    \ aver-\nage from observation wells (McGuire, 2009). Aquifer stor-\nage depletion\
    \ started in the 1960s, reached the maximum\nduring the 1970s, and remained stable\
    \ since then. During\nthe 1980s, the aquifer storage depletion recovers slightly,\n\
    which corresponds to the irrigation regulation within the re-\ngion started in\
    \ the late 1980s. According to the records of the\nUS Geological Survey (USGS),\
    \ the water table in the aquifer\nremains in a declining trend but at a slower\
    \ rate in recent\nyears (McGuire, 2012). The decline of the aquifer storage\n\
    during the period 2009–2011 is estimated as 2.8 million acre-\nft., equivalent\
    \ to 0.1 ft. decline in the water table. Thus, the\nintensive pumping reverses\
    \ the natural seasonal groundwa-\nter recharge pattern, from “summer recharge\
    \ and winter dis-\ncharge” under natural conditions to “summer discharge and\n\
    winter recharge” under the human interferences.\n4\nConclusions\nStreamﬂow change\
    \ is a result of climate forcings, catch-\nment properties and human activities\
    \ in watersheds around\nthe world. At the study site discussed in this paper,\
    \ stream-\nﬂow records at the gauging stations reﬂect the synthetical\neffect\
    \ of dynamic interactions between surface water and\ngroundwater systems, which\
    \ are enhanced by groundwater\npumping and return ﬂow with heavy groundwater-fed\
    \ irri-\ngation. In this study, a modeling analysis based on a mod-\niﬁed SWAT\
    \ model is applied to analyze the conjunctive ef-\nfects of pumping and irrigation\
    \ return ﬂow on streamﬂow. By\nrelating baseﬂow to shallow aquifer storage through\
    \ a lin-\near reservoir model, the streamﬂow response to groundwa-\nter pumping\
    \ is explicitly simulated, and the synthetic effects\nof two types of human interferences\
    \ (i.e., pumping and re-\nturn ﬂow) are assessed. While irrigation return ﬂow\
    \ partially\ncompensates the decrease in streamﬂow, the stream deple-\ntion trend\
    \ due to groundwater pumping has been revealed by\nthe model as comparable to\
    \ the observed. However, the fast\nﬂow component (surface and subsurface ﬂow)\
    \ increases due\nto return ﬂow and the slow ﬂow component (baseﬂow) de-\ncreases\
    \ due to groundwater pumping. As a result, the stream-\nﬂow is altered from a\
    \ baseﬂow dominant regime to one that is\nmore inﬂuenced by surface and subsurface\
    \ ﬂow. The change\namong baseﬂow, subsurface and surface ﬂow components\ndue to\
    \ human interferences is modeled for the ﬁrst time, ac-\ncording to our knowledge,\
    \ which allows a close examination\nof the streamﬂow variability, rooted with\
    \ climatic variability\nbut aggravated by human interferences (groundwater pump-\n\
    ing and return ﬂow). Agricultural water use in this region has\nshifted the groundwater\
    \ seasonal regime from the pattern of\n“summer recharge and winter discharge”\
    \ in the past to “sum-\nmer discharge and winter recharge” at present. This could\n\
    affect the ecosystems that depend on the streamﬂow regime.\nMoreover the shift\
    \ challenges existing groundwater model-\ning, which usually assumes ﬁxed recharge\
    \ patterns and rates.\nAlthough the modiﬁed model can simulate streamﬂow re-\n\
    sponse to groundwater pumping, it only represents one way\nof the stream–aquifer\
    \ interaction, that is, ﬂow from aquifer to\nstream. This limits the model to\
    \ simulate the situation where\ngroundwater pumping inverses stream–aquifer interaction.\n\
    This model is valid in a headwater zone such as FCB, where\nbaseﬂow is sustained\
    \ by the aquifer, but may not be appli-\ncable to areas where streamﬂow recharges\
    \ the aquifer. Also,\nthe SWAT model is semi-distributed, that is, each hydrolog-\n\
    ical representative unit is only connected with each other by\nriver network and\
    \ no interaction exists due to the water table\ngradient. Thus, the assessment\
    \ of aquifer storage is averaged\nfrom all subbasins. Improvement of the subbasin\
    \ aquifer stor-\nage connection would provide the spatial impact of ground-\n\
    water movement. If spatial information (e.g., impact of the\nlocation of pumping\
    \ wells relative to streams, the location of\ndrawdown cones, etc.) is included,\
    \ the groundwater move-\nment under human interferences can be better understood.\n\
    We admit that the model presented (even with our modiﬁ-\ncation) is not ideal\
    \ for simulating the sophisticated relation-\nship between irrigation pumping\
    \ and streamﬂow, which in-\nvolves the dynamic interactions of surface water and\
    \ ground-\nwater. As discussed in the introduction, both surface hy-\ndrology\
    \ and groundwater communities assess the stream–\naquifer interaction from different\
    \ aspects. Simulation mod-\nels from both communities have a different focus with\
    \ re-\nspect to their interests. However, surface water and ground-\nwater are\
    \ a holistic entity that requires an integrated mod-\neling approach, which is\
    \ currently not well developed. We\nbelieve the modiﬁcation of a widely used watershed\
    \ manage-\nment model (SWAT) can serve the purpose of analysis, espe-\ncially\
    \ for the understanding of agricultural development and\nstreamﬂow change. Our\
    \ study presents an effort to improve\nthe watershed model to better assess basin-wide\
    \ surface wa-\nter and groundwater interaction with intensive agricultural\nHydrol.\

    Nano-silicon application is an efﬁcient novel approach to mitigate the deleterious
    impacts

    of drought stress on ﬁeld crops, which is expected to increase owing to climate

    change, especially in arid regions. Two-season ﬁeld studies investigated the inﬂuence

    of foliar-applied nano-silicon (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM) on physiological and biochemical

    attributes and their impacts on crop water productivity (CWP) and the agronomic
    traits

    of faba beans (Vicia faba). The plants were evaluated under two irrigation regimes:

    well-watered (100% ETc giving 406 mm ha−1) and drought stress (65% ETc giving

    264 mm ha−1). It was found that drought stress signiﬁcantly decreased gas exchange

    (leaf net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and rate of transpiration),
    water

    relations (relative water content and membrane stability index), nutrient uptake
    (N, P,

    K+, and Ca+2), ﬂavonoids, and phenolic content. In contrast, drought stress signiﬁcantly

    increased oxidative stress (H2O2 and O·−

    2 ) and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    activities compared with the well-watered treatment. These inﬂuences of drought

    stress were negatively reﬂected in seed yield-related traits and CWP. However,
    foliar

    treatment with nano-silicon, particularly with 1.5 mM, limited the devastating
    impact of

    drought stress and markedly enhanced all the aforementioned parameters. Therefore,

    exogenously applied nano-silicon could be used to improve the CWP and seed and

    biological yields of faba bean plants under conditions with low water availability
    in

    arid environments.

    INTRODUCTION

    Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) are an important legume crop grown worldwide (Gasim
    et al., 2015).

    These plants have high crude protein content and essential amino acids (Vogelsang-O’dwyer

    et al., 2020) and improve soil nitrogen content through the symbiotic ﬁxation
    of atmospheric

    nitrogen, which reduces the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural
    production systems

    Desoky et al.

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    (Liu et al., 2019). Faba beans are cultivated in the Mediterranean

    region as a rotational crop and ﬁx more than 80% of the nitrogen

    requirements of the plant (Denton et al., 2017). However, it is

    highly sensitive to water deﬁcits compared with other ﬁeld crops

    (Parvin et al., 2019).

    The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable areas

    to the deleterious impacts of climate change, with ﬂuctuations

    in precipitation and water shortage being projected to increase,

    particularly in arid and semi-arid environments (García-Ruiz

    et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2018; Spinoni et al.,

    2018; Chiwetalu et al., 2020). As a result, water scarcity causes

    destructive alterations in the biochemical and physiological

    processes of plants and, consequently, reduces their growth and

    productivity (Siddiqui et al., 2015; Attia et al., 2021; Desoky

    et al., 2021; Mansour et al., 2021). Therefore, it is crucial

    to mitigate the deleterious impacts of water deﬁciency using

    practical approaches to boost drought tolerance in ﬁeld crops

    (Semida et al., 2020; Abd El-Mageed et al., 2021; El-Sanatawy

    et al., 2021).

    Silicon (Si) considerably increases mechanical strength and

    membrane stability of cell. It also maintains membrane integrity,

    mineral nutrition, photosynthesis eﬃciency, and the tolerance

    defense system (Spinoni et al., 2018; Desoky et al., 2020). As a

    result, Si can be used to alleviate the negative impacts of water

    deﬁcits and improve plant growth and productivity owing to its

    beneﬁcial physicomechanical functions (Rady et al., 2019).

    Recently, nanomaterials have become a desirable solution to

    many technological and environmental challenges in numerous

    ﬁelds (Ansari and Husain, 2012). Nano-silicon has displayed

    superior physicochemical properties owing to its microscopic

    size compared with bulk Si (Prasad et al., 2012; Rastogi et al.,

    2019). Furthermore, nano-silicon has a larger surface area,

    greater surface reactivity and solubility, and numerous well-

    characterized surface properties compared with bulk Si (Qados

    and Moftah, 2015). In particular, particle size is considered

    to be one of the most crucial factors impacting particle

    adhesion, uptake, and transportation into plant cells (Smith

    et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). In addition, nanoparticles

    interact with plant cells and assist in the transportation of

    diﬀerent substances that can regulate plant metabolism and

    several physiological processes (Galbraith, 2007; Torney et al.,

    2007; Giraldo et al., 2014).

    Investigations into the inﬂuence of nano metals and their

    mechanisms are still at the rudimentary stage. Studies related to

    nano-silicon application and its contribution to the attenuation

    of the adverse impacts of drought stress and the increasing

    of faba bean productivity under water-deﬁcit conditions,

    particularly under ﬁeld conditions, are lacking. Based on the

    results of previous investigations, we hypothesized that the

    application of nano-silicon would notably improve faba bean

    plant performance (growth and productivity) by improving

    the eﬃciency of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, in

    turn reducing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species

    (ROS). Accordingly, we investigated the role of exogenously

    applied nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) at diﬀerent concentrations

    in ameliorating the drought tolerance of faba bean plants at the

    morphological, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic levels.

    This knowledge will assist in enhancing the drought tolerance of

    faba bean plants for their cultivation in arid environments.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    Description of the Experimental Site

    A ﬁeld experiment was undertaken during the 2018–2019 and

    2019–2020 winter growing seasons at the experimental farm of

    the Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt

    (30◦36′57′′N, 31◦46′58′′E). The site was characterized by low

    precipitation and an arid climate, with an average annual

    rainfall of ∼60 mm. The results of the soil analysis, including

    bulk soil density, ﬁeld capacity, wilting point, pH, texture, and

    soil composition, are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The

    monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall for

    the two winters and the 35-year averages (from 1986 to 2020)

    were obtained from a station close to the experimental site

    (Supplementary Table 2).

    Agronomic Practices

    Phosphorus fertilizer was added at a rate of 31 kg P ha−1

    as calcium superphosphate [Ca(H2PO4)2, 15.5% P2O5] before

    sowing. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer was added at a rate of 45 kg N

    ha−1 as ammonium-sulfate [(NH4)2SO4, 21% N] as fertigation

    one time at sowing. Potassium (K) fertilizer was applied at

    a rate of 95 kg K ha−1 as potassium sulfate (K2SO4, 48%

    K2O) in two equal doses every two weeks after sowing. The

    sowing dates of both seasons were performed according to the

    optimal period for growing faba beans in the region during the

    ﬁrst week of November. The genotype used in this experiment

    was a recommended commercial cultivar in the region (Giza-

    843). Standard agronomic practices, comprising drip irrigation,

    sowing date, chemical fertilization, weed, disease, and pest

    control, were applied as recommended for the commercial

    production of faba beans.

    Experimental Design and Irrigation

    Regimes

    The experimental design was a split-plot, with randomized

    irrigation regimes in the main plots and foliar treatments in sub-

    plots in three replicates. Each plot consisted of six rows that

    were 5 m long with 0.65 m between rows. The plant spacing

    was 0.15 m, resulting in ∼205,130 plants per ha−1. A drip

    irrigation system was used to meet the study objectives, with drip

    laterals and emitters were spaced at 0.65 and 0.3 m, respectively.

    The operating pressure and emitter ﬂow rate were kept at 1

    bar and 4 L h−1, respectively, and maintained using a valve

    and pressure gauge for each irrigation sector. Irrigation water

    quantity was measured independently for each irrigation regime

    using a ﬂow meter. Irrigation scheduling was based on potential

    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) replacement according to the

    crop coeﬃcient approach (Allen et al., 1998). The ETc was

    determined by multiplying the daily reference evapotranspiration

    (ETo) by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop

    coeﬃcients (Kc) of faba beans (Allen et al., 1998). The ETo was

    determined from weather data using the FAO-56-standardized

    Penman–Monteith equation as stated by Allen et al. (1998).

    Desoky et al.

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    Daily meteorological data, including minimum, maximum, and

    dew point temperatures and wind speed, were taken from the

    closest weather station to calculate the ETo. The Kc ﬁgures for

    faba beans, as suggested by the FAO-56, were altered based

    on the obtained climatic values, including the wind speed and

    relative humidity of the experimental site. During the ﬁrst and

    second growing seasons, the total amount of the full irrigation

    regime (100% ETc) was 400 and 412 mm ha−1, respectively. The

    drought stress regime was 35% less (260 and 268 mm ha−1) than

    the well-watered treatment from the seedling establishment to

    physiological maturity in both seasons. Irrigation was applied

    weekly from full emergence to ﬂowering and then two times a

    week from ﬂowering to maturity. Irrigation was discontinued 2

    weeks before harvest (mid-April).

    Foliar Application of Nano-SiO2

    Nano-silicon dioxide (99.5% pure; 20–30 nm) (Sigma-Aldrich

    Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany), with a corresponding

    surface area of 180–600 m2 g−1, was used in the study

    (Supplementary Figure 1). Foliar sprays of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM

    nano-SiO2 were applied using a pressurized spray bottle with

    0.1% Tween 20 as a surface spreader. Spraying with distilled water

    was used as a control for foliar treatments.

    Agronomic Traits Measurements

    At the end of the growing season, the plant height, which was

    from the soil surface to the uppermost leaf tip, was measured

    for 10 replicate plants in each plot. Three middle rows from each

    plot were harvested from a total area of 9.8 m2 to determine the

    yield components (number of pods per plant and seeds per pod

    and 100-seed weight), seed yield, and aboveground biomass. The

    100-seed weight was assessed from the weight of the three sets of

    100 seeds.

    Crop Water Productivity

    The crop water productivity (kg m−3) for seed yield (CWPs)

    and aboveground biomass (CWPab) was estimated as the ratio

    of seed yield or aboveground biomass (kg ha−1) to crop

    evapotranspiration (ET, m3) following the formula of Pereira

    et al. (2012) and Fernández et al. (2020):

    CWP (kg m−3) = Yield

    ET

    Crop evapotranspiration (ET, mm) was calculated according to

    the water balance equation (James, 1988): ET = IW + P +

    Cr + Dp ± Rf ± 1S, where IW is the irrigation water amount

    (mm), P is the seasonal precipitation (mm), Cr is the capillary

    rise to the root zone (mm), Dp is the deep percolation (mm), Rf

    is the surface runoﬀ (mm), and 1S is the soil moisture change

    in the crop root zone (mm). The Cr in this study was zero as the

    groundwater table was 15 m below the ground surface. The Dp

    and Rf were neglected owing to the use of a drip irrigation system.

    Furthermore, the soil water content was determined using an

    oven drying method for all the experimental plots. Soil samples

    were collected at planting and harvest from soil depths of 0–

    30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm to estimate the initial and ﬁnal soil

    moisture content during the two growing seasons. The ﬁgures

    were converted to a volumetric basis and multiplied by soil depth

    and bulk density.

    Determination of PSII Quantum Yield and

    CO2 Fixation Rate

    All gas exchange measurements were performed using a Li-

    6400XT portable photosynthesis system equipped with a 6400-40

    leaf chamber ﬂuorescence head and a 6400-02 B LED light source

    (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. To

    avoid errors, CO2 leakage was corrected according to Flexas et al.

    (2007). All types of measurement (light response curves and CO2

    response curves) were applied on the third leaves of three plants

    at each light intensity. Before starting the CO2 response curve

    measurements, the leaf was adapted for 5–20 min to ensure that

    photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and ﬂuorescence signal

    were stable and rubisco was fully activated. The ﬁrst point was

    measured under a reference CO2 concentration (Ca) of 400 ppm.

    The A–Ci measurements were conducted at the reference CO2

    concentration of 400 ppm, followed by 300, 200, 100, 50, 150,

    250, 350, 600, 900, 1,200, and 1,500 ppm under the saturating

    light conditions of 1,300 µmol m2 s−1 (Loriaux et al., 2013). The

    ﬂuorometer measuring light was turned on and set to measure

    light frequency = 10 kHz, intensity = 3, ﬁlter = 5, and gain = 10.

    The ﬂash was set to multiphase pulse, with a target intensity = 9,

    ramp depth = 30%, measuring frequency = 20 kHz, and ﬁlter =

    50 kHz. The three phases were 320, 350, and 200 ms long (Chen

    et al., 2014).

    Determination of Relative Water Content,

    the Membrane Stability Index, Leaf Soluble

    Sugars, and Proline Content

    Relative water content (RWC) was assessed following the method

    of Osman and Rady (2014) and determined using the following

    equation: RWC (%) = FM−DM

    TM−DM × 100, where FM is fresh mass,

    DM is dry mass, and TM is turgid mass. The membrane stability

    index (MSI) was determined by adding 200 mg of fresh leaves into

    test tubes containing 10 cm3 of double-distilled water. One set

    was heated at 40◦C for 30 min in a water bath, and the electrical

    conductivity of the solution was recorded on a conductivity

    bridge (C1). A replicated set was boiled at 100◦C in a water

    bath for 10 min, with conductivity also being measured (C2).

    The MSI was calculated as described by Rady (2011) using the

    following equation: MSI (%) = 1 − EC1

    EC2 × 100, where EC1

    is the electrical conductivity at 40◦C and EC2 is the electrical

    conductivity at 100◦C.

    The total soluble sugars of 0.2 g of leaf washed with 5 ml

    of 70% ethanol and homogenized with 5 ml of 96% ethanol

    were determined following the method of Irigoyen et al. (1992).

    Brieﬂy, the extract was centrifuged at 1,372 × g for 10 min, and

    the supernatant was collected and stored at 4◦C. Freshly prepared

    anthrone (3 ml) was added to a 0.1 ml supernatant and incubated

    in a hot water bath for 10 min. Absorbance was measured at

    520 nm (Jenway Spectrophotometer 6705, Staﬀordshire, UK),

    and the sugar content was determined from the standard curve

    (Supplementary Figure 2). One gram of glucose was dissolved in

    distilled water, with the volume amounting to 1 L. The diﬀerent

    Desoky et al.

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    volumes of the glucose solution were taken and made to amount

    to 100 ml with distilled water in volumetric ﬂasks. Finally, the

    relationship between the readings at 520 nm and the known

    concentration of glucose was plotted (Supplementary Figure 2).

    A rapid colorimetric assay was performed to measure the proline

    content in 0.5 g dried leaf samples according to Bates et al.

    (1973). The absorbance was recorded at 520 nm, with the proline

    content being determined from the standard curve. The proline

    standard curve was developed using 1 g of pure proline, which

    was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Supplementary Figure 3).

    Assessing Antioxidant Enzyme Activity

    Enzyme extraction was performed according to the method of

    Vitória et al. (2001). Brieﬂy, fresh leaf samples were collected in

    an icebox and taken to the laboratory. Distilled water was used to

    wash the leaves, following which, the surfaces of the leaves were

    wiped out of moisture. The leaf sample (0.5 g) was homogenized

    in 0.1 M of an ice-cold phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.5) containing

    0.5 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) using a pre-

    chilled mortar and pestle. The homogenate was then transferred

    to centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4◦C in a Beckman Coulter

    refrigerated centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., California, USA)

    at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to

    30-ml tubes and referred to the enzyme extract.

    Catalase

    (CAT)

    was

    estimated

    spectrophotometrically

    according to Britton and Mehley (1955). Brieﬂy, the enzyme

    extract (100 µl) was added to 100 µl of 100 mM of H2O2, and

    the total volume has amounted to 1 ml with 250 mM of the

    phosphate buﬀer at pH 6.8. The reduction in optical density

    at 240 nm against the blank was measured every minute. The

    activity of peroxidase (POD) was estimated as described by

    Thomas et al. (1982) using guaiacol as the substrate. The

    reaction mixture contained 3 ml of the phosphate buﬀer (0.1 M,

    pH 7), 50 ml of enzyme extract, 30 ml of H2O2 (20 mM),

    and 50 ml of guaiacol (20 mM). The reaction mixture was

    incubated in a cuvette for 10 min at room temperature. The

    optical density was recorded at 436 nm, and the enzyme activity

    was expressed as the number of absorbance units g−1 fresh

    weight of leaves. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was

    determined by recording the reduction in the absorbance of the

    superoxide-nitro blue tetrazolium complex by the enzyme SOD

    (Sairam et al., 2002). Approximately 3 ml of a reaction mixture

    comprising 0.2 ml of 200 mM methionine, 0.1 ml of 3 mM EDTA,

    0.1 ml of 1.5 M sodium carbonate, 1.5 ml of 100 mM potassium

    phosphate buﬀer pH 7, 0.1 ml of 2.25 mM nitro blue tetrazolium,

    1 ml of distilled water, and 0.05 ml of the enzyme, which were

    all collected in duplicates from each of the enzyme samples into

    test tubes. Two tubes without the enzyme extract were used as

    controls. The reaction was started by adding 0.1 ml riboﬂavin

    (60 µM) and placing the tubes below a light source (two 15-W

    ﬂuorescent lamps) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by

    turning oﬀ the light and covering the tubes with a black cloth.

    The tubes without the enzyme developed the maximum color. A

    non-irradiated complete reaction mixture that did not develop

    color served as a blank. The absorbance was recorded at 560 nm,

    and one unit of enzyme activity was taken as the quantity of

    enzymes that reduced the absorbance readings of samples to 50%

    compared with the tubes lacking enzymes.

    Determination of Antioxidant Compounds

    and Oxidative Stress (H2O2 and O·−

    2 )

    Content

    The content of ascorbate (AsA; µmol g−1 FW) was determined

    as described by Kampfenkel et al. (1995). Reduced glutathione

    (GsH; µmol g−1 FW) was estimated according to the method of

    Griﬃth (1980). The α-tocopherol was estimated in accordance

    with the methods of Konings et al. (1996) and Ching and

    Mohamed (2001). Finally, the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2

    µmol g−1 leaf FW) was determined as reported by Velikova et al.

    (2000) and superoxide (O·−

    2 ) level was determined as described

    by Kubi´s (2008).

    Determination of N, P, K+, and Ca+2

    Content

    Dried powder samples (0.1 g) were digested for 12 h in a mixture

    of 2 ml of perchloric acid (80%) with 10 ml of concentrated

    H2SO4. Each sample was diluted with distilled water to a volume

    of 100 ml. Total N was estimated using a micro-Kjeldahl method

    as described by Chapman and Pratt (1982). Total P was estimated

    colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid method as described by

    Watanabe and Olsen (1965). Flame photometry was used to

    analyze the K+ and Ca+2 content according to the method of

    Williams and Twine (1960).

    Preparation of Seed Extracts for

    Biochemical Analyses

    The seeds were homogenized using a lab grinder and stored

    in airtight jars maintained at 4◦C. Dried materials (10 g)

    were defatted by hexane 60–80 and then separately extracted

    successively with ethanol 70% (1:10 ratio) by soaking at room

    temperature for 12 h. The extract was centrifuged at 784 × g for

    15 min (Jouan, MR 1822, Pays de la Loire, France). Extraction

    and ﬁltration were repeated until the residue was colorless. The

    solvent was removed under vacuum at 40◦C using a rotary

    evaporator (Laborota 4000-eﬃcient, Heidolph, Germany), and

    extracts were freeze-dried using a lyophilizer. The obtained

    powder extracts were preserved in light-protected containers

    at −18◦C.

    Determination of Biochemical Parameters

    The antioxidant activity was determined using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-

    picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The free radical scavenging activity was

    estimated as a percentage of DPPH discoloration as described

    by Blois (1958). The ﬂavonoids content in the extracts was

    estimated following the colorimetric method based on the

    formation of ﬂavonoid-aluminum compounds (Zhishen et al.,

    1999). Total polyphenols were estimated following the Folin–

    Ciocalteu method of Singleton and Rossi (1965).

    staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma-Aldrich).

    Statistical Analysis

    The R statistical software version 3.6.1 was used to analyze the

    data. A combined analysis of variance was performed for the

    split-plot design with irrigation regimes, foliar applications,

    and their interactions as ﬁxed eﬀects, while growing seasons,

    replications, and their interactions were considered random

    eﬀects.

    component analysis (PCA) estimated the association between

    evaluated traits.

    RESULTS

    Agronomic Traits and CWP

    The water-deﬁcit treatment signiﬁcantly decreased plant height,

    100-seed weight, number of pods per plant, number of seeds

    per pod, seed yield, and aboveground biomass compared with

    the well-watered treatment (Table 1). Nano-SiO2 substantially

    enhanced all agronomic traits compared with the corresponding

    untreated plants under both watering regimes. The greatest yield

    was achieved with 1.5 mM, followed by 1 mM nano-SiO2 in

    the well-watered treatment. Treatment with 1.5 mM nano-SiO2

    also increased the seed yield by 14.2% in well-watered plants

    and 27.7% in drought-stressed plants compared with those in

    untreated plants (Figure 1).

    The CWP for seed yield (CWPs) ranged from 1.22 to 1.65 kg

    m−3, while the aboveground biomass (CWPab) ranged from 2.81

    to 3.72 kg m−3 (Table 1). Under drought stress conditions, faba

    bean plants possessed higher CWPs (on average 1.5 kg m−3) and

    CWPab (3.8 kg m−3) than those that underwent the well-watered

    treatment (1.31 and 3.12 kg m−3, respectively). Drought-stressed

    plants also had a higher CWP than well-watered plants due to

    their more eﬃcient water consumption and water loss reduction

    due to osmotic regulation. The application of nano-SiO2 also

    signiﬁcantly improved CWPs and CWPab compared with the

    untreated stressed controls. The highest CWPs (1.65 kg m−3) and

    CWPab (3.72 kg m−3) were achieved with the application of 1.5

    mM nano-SiO2.

    Physiological Parameters

    Drought stress signiﬁcantly reduced the net photosynthetic rate

    (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (gs), RWC,

    MSI, and nutrient content (N, P, K+, and Ca+2) of faba bean

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    FIGURE 1 | Percentage change (increase or decrease) in morphological, agronomic,
    physiological, and biochemical attributes upon the application of 1.5 mM

    nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) compared with untreated faba bean (Vicia faba)
    plants under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions.

    plants (Table 2). All nano-SiO2 treatments mitigated the damage

    of drought stress and signiﬁcantly improved all physiological

    parameters. The highest values were seen in well-watered plants

    treated with 1.5 mM nano-SiO2, while the lowest values were

    recorded in the control water-stressed plants (Table 2).

    Drought-stressed plants increased free proline and soluble

    sugars and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, POD,

    and SOD. Furthermore, the non-enzymatic antioxidants AsA,

    GsH, and α-tocopherol were higher compared with non-stressed

    faba beans (Table 3). In contrast, the application of nano-

    SiO2 signiﬁcantly increased the free proline and soluble sugar

    contents and the activities of antioxidant enzymes and non-

    enzymatic antioxidant compounds compared with the untreated

    plants under both irrigation regimes. The highest values were

    achieved with the application of 1.5 mM of nano-SiO2 to the

    stressed plants (Table 3). Increasing free proline, soluble sugars,

    antioxidant enzyme activities, and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    compound content helped the faba bean plants alleviate the

    negative impacts of water scarcity.

    In addition, irrigation regimes and nano-SiO2 application

    signiﬁcantly impacted oxidative stress biomarkers (Table 3).

    The levels of H2O2 and O·−

    were signiﬁcantly increased in

    stressed compared with non-stressed plants. Furthermore, the

    application of nano-SiO2 to plants in the water-deﬁcit treatment

    signiﬁcantly lowered H2O2 and O·−

    2 levels compared with those

    in untreated plants.

    nano-SiO2 signiﬁcantly enhanced these parameters compared

    with those in the untreated plants under both irrigation regimes.

    The highest antioxidant activity and values of ﬂavonoids and

    phenolics were produced by the 1.5-mM nano-SiO2 application

    in the water-deﬁcit treatments, while the lowest values were

    recorded in the well-watered control plants (Table 4).

    Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide

    Gel Electrophoresis Protein Pattern

    The SDS-PAGE patterns displayed nine protein bands (170, 158,

    110, 90, 81, 63, 57, 40, and 30 kD) in untreated faba bean plants

    grown under well-watered or water-deﬁcit conditions (Table 5).

    However, the nano-SiO2 concentrations of 1 and 1.5 mM created

    a protein fraction with a molecular weight of 129 kD only in

    the faba bean plants grown under drought stress. Only nine

    bands were observed in the rest of the treatments in both

    watering regimes.

    Interrelationship Among Evaluated Traits

    The PCA of the agronomic, physiological, and biochemical traits

    showed that the ﬁrst two principal components accounted for

    most of the variability, which was ∼98.41% (83.43% by PC1

    and 14.98% by PC2; Figure 2). In the PC biplot, the traits were

    represented by parallel vectors or those that were close to each

    other, indicating a strong positive association, whereas those that

    were situated approximately opposite (at 180◦) showed a highly

    negative relationship. In addition, the vectors toward the sides

    expressed a slight relationship. The 30 investigated traits could be

    classiﬁed into three groups: the ﬁrst group (15 traits) comprises

    agronomic traits, namely, Pn, Tr, gs, MSI, RWC, and nutrient

    contents (N, P, K+, and Ca+2), the second group (13 traits)

    consisted of the CWP for seed yield and aboveground biomass,

    antioxidant activity, ﬂavonoids and phenolic contents, proline

    and soluble sugar contents, enzymatic antioxidants (POD, CAT,

    and SOD), and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds (AsA,

    GsH, α-TOC, proline, and soluble sugars), and the third group

    contained H2O2 and O.−

    2 . Furthermore, PC1 separated the

    treatments into two groups. The well-watered treatments were

    located on the positive side, while those under drought stress

    were located on the negative side (Figure 2). The traits in the

    ﬁrst group were associated with well-watered plants, especially

    those that were treated with 1 and 1.5 mM nano-SiO2, while

    the biochemical attributes in the second and third groups were

    associated with the drought-stressed treatments.

    DISCUSSION

    Water scarcity stress poses great challenges to sustainable faba

    bean production due to its sensitivity to drought. Consequently, it

    is vital to identify novel approaches to enhance drought tolerance,

    especially under conditions of abrupt climate change. In the

    current study, drought-stressed faba bean plants exhibited a

    decline in seed yield-related traits and CWP and an increase

    in oxidative and osmotic stress compared with those of

    well-watered plants. As a result, exogenously applied nano-

    SiO2 enhanced gas exchange, water relations, nutrient uptake,

    activities of antioxidant enzymes, and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    compounds, which substantially reduced oxidative stress and

    positively reﬂected the improvement of drought tolerance in faba

    bean plants with enhancements in yield-related traits and CWP.

    The Si nanoparticles have great availability and are easily

    absorbed by plants compared with bulk Si, consequently

    supporting greater ameliorative impacts under abiotic stresses

    (Suriyaprabha et al., 2012; Tripathi et al., 2016). The obtained

    results

    demonstrated

    that

    the

    application

    of

    nano-SiO2,

    particularly at 1.5 mM, considerably boosted photosynthetic

    eﬀectiveness and leaf gas exchange (e.g., Pn, Tr, and gs) in

    plants under water-deﬁcit stress compared to those that were

    untreated. Promoting photosynthetic eﬃciency maintenance

    could be attributed to optimal stomatal conductance and strong

    antioxidant activities, which improve plant tolerance to drought

    stress (Suriyaprabha et al., 2012; Haghighi and Pessarakli, 2013;

    Rios et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2021). Furthermore, the application

    of nano-SiO2 increased the water uptake from roots to leaves

    by enhancing the RWC and MSI in treated faba bean plants

    compared with those in control plants under drought stress.

    Previous studies have also found that maintaining RWC and

    MSI at a healthy status enhances osmotic adjustments and

    metabolic activities under conditions of drought stress (Slabbert

    and Krüger, 2014). In this study, nano-SiO2 application likely

    boosted the water content of plants by decreasing stomatal

    transpiration and increasing turgor pressure and potassium

    absorbance (Romero-Aranda et al., 2006; Tahir et al., 2012;

    Liu et al., 2014; Cerný et al., 2020). Furthermore, nano-SiO2

    application signiﬁcantly improved the absorption of the nutrients

    N, P, K+, and Ca+2 in faba bean plants under drought stress. In

    addition, it has been found that mineral nutrient uptake depends

    mainly on membrane activity, which plays a fundamental role

    in the ion movement from the soil to the plant and controls the

    allocation of cells (Khoshgoftarmanesh et al., 2014; Gupta et al.,

    2016). These enhancements in water movement and nutrient

    absorption enable improvements in all physiological activities of

    the cells.

    Within cells, the accumulation of compatible solutes under

    stress eﬀectively maintains the status of plant cell water.

    For example, proline is an excellent compatible osmolyte

    that improves plant antioxidant systems and aﬀects osmotic

    adjustment (Zhu, 2001; Desoky et al., 2020). Soluble sugars

    also maintain the balance between the vacuole and the osmotic

    quality of cytosol under abiotic stress conditions (Sairam

    et al., 2002). The results indicated that the application of

    nano-SiO2 elevated the proline and soluble sugar contents in

    drought-stressed plants. Therefore, its application improved

    plant tolerance by elevating osmolyte content, altering osmotic

    potential, and maintaining higher turgor in response to drought

    stress (Claussen, 2005; Rizwan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017;

    Desoky et al., 2020). Furthermore, improved enzymatic and non-

    enzymatic defense systems can alleviate the overproduction of

    ROS, such as O·−

    2

    and H2O2, produced in response to drought

    stress. The enzymatic defense system components SOD, CAT,

    and POD and the non-enzymatic defense system components

    GsH, AsA, and α-TOC were signiﬁcantly increased following

    the application of nano-SiO2 compared with those in untreated

    plants under drought stress. Accordingly, the application of

    nano-SiO2 lowered the concentrations of O·−

    2

    and H2O2 and,

    therefore, reduced oxidative stress in drought-stressed faba bean

    plants. Consequently, the application of nano-SiO2 could be an

    eﬀective tool to increase faba bean tolerance to oxidative stress

    by enhancing ROS scavenging enzymatic and non-enzymatic

    defense systems (Rios et al., 2017; Rady et al., 2019).

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    FIGURE 2 | Biplot of the ﬁrst two principal components for the physiological,
    biochemical, and agronomic traits of faba beans (Vicia faba). The physiological

    parameters comprised of net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr),
    stomatal conductance (gs), relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index
    (MSI),

    nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) content, proline content
    (Pro), soluble sugars (SSu), peroxidase activity (POD), catalase activity (CAT),

    superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GsH), hydrogen
    peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O.−

    2 ), and α-tocopherol (α-TOC). The

    biochemical parameters included antioxidant activity % (Ant%), ﬂavonoids content
    (Flav), and phenolic content (Phen). The agronomic traits were plant height (PH),

    number of pods plant−1 (NP/P), number of seeds pod−1 (NS/P), 100-seed weight (100-SW),
    seed yield (SY), aboveground biomass (AB), crop water productivity for

    seed yield (CWPs), and aboveground biomass (CWPab). WW-Cont, WW-T1, WW-T2, and
    WW-T3 were foliar applications using tap water, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM of

    nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) under the well-watered treatment, respectively.
    DS-Cont, DS-T1, DS-T2, and DS-T3 were foliar applications using tap water, 0.5,
    1,

    and 1.5 mM of nano-SiO2 under the drought stress treatment.

    The application of nano-SiO2 enhanced ﬂavonoids, phenolic

    compounds, and antioxidant activity levels, particularly in

    drought-stressed faba bean plants. The utilization of these

    protection systems helps to overcome oxidative damage, which

    has been suggested to occur through the synthesis of secondary

    metabolites, such as ﬂavonoids and phenolic contents (Blokhina

    et al., 2003). These metabolites can forestall protein denaturation,

    DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation (Król et al., 2014; Quan

    et al., 2016). Although Si is not a fundamental component of

    plants, it has a beneﬁcial impact in improving protection against

    drought stress through the initiation of protective proteins and

    the reduction of ROS (Suriyaprabha et al., 2013; Luyckx et al.,

    2017). In addition, the electrograph of the protein fraction

    proﬁle showed that the application of 1 and 1.5 mM nano-

    SiO2 led to the generation of a new protein fraction (molecular

    weight: 129 kD).

    The application of nano-SiO2 exhibited signiﬁcant positive

    alterations in all the investigated physiological and biochemical

    attributes

    under

    water-deﬁcit

    conditions.

    Accordingly,

    treated plants grew more eﬃciently under drought stress

    compared with untreated plants and coped with water deﬁcit

    conditions.

    Nano-SiO2

    application,

    particularly

    using

    a

    concentration of 1.5 mM as an optimum level, attenuated

    eﬃciency,

    plant

    water

    status,

    nutrient

    absorption, nutrient uptake, non-enzymatic and enzymatic

    antioxidant activities, and ROS scavenging. These promotional

    inﬂuences were reﬂected in increasing seed yield and all its

    related traits and CWP compared with the corresponding

    untreated plants.

    We

    speculate

    that

    the

    high

    values of these physiological parameters are associated with

    greater seed yield and contributing traits, particularly under

    conditions of drought stress. Otherwise, the CWPs and CWPab

    demonstrated a highly positive association with antioxidant

    activity, ﬂavonoids, and phenolic compounds. In addition,

    the agronomic traits exhibited a highly negative association

    with H2O2 and O.−

    2

    (Desoky et al., 2020; Mansour et al.,

    2020, 2021). According to these results, it is interesting to

    photosynthetic rate, and ﬂavonoids and phenolic content

    compared with the same levels in well-watered plants. These

    adverse impacts were reﬂected in decreased yield-related

    traits and CWP. However, exogenously applied nano-SiO2,

    particularly at 1.5 mM, mitigated the negative impacts of

    drought stress and promoted plant growth by boosting all

    of the investigated physiological attributes. In addition, the

    application of nano-SiO2 decreased the membrane leakage

    of electrolytes and membrane lipid peroxidation due to

    reduced drought-stimulated oxidative stress by enhancing the

    activity of osmoprotectants and the enzymatic and non-

    enzymatic defense system components under drought stress.

    Consequently, nano-SiO2 had a positive inﬂuence on the

    physiological, biochemical, and agronomic traits of drought-

    stressed plants and alleviated the inﬂuence of drought stress on

    faba bean plants.

    \ and yield responses of cabbage to deficit irrigation. Hort. Sci. \n(Prague),\
    \ 41: 138–146.\nField experiments were conducted in two seasons to investigate\
    \ growth, physiology and yield responses of cabbage (Bras-\nsica oleracea L. cvs\
    \ Pennant and Rio Grande) to deficit irrigation. In 2012 season, 50% of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) \nirrigation temporarily decreased plant size, reduced leaf area, fresh\
    \ weight, relative water content, specific leaf area and \ngas exchange during\
    \ late development, and decreased head fresh weight, size, marketable and total\
    \ yield. Deficit irrigation \nat 75% ETc had little influence on plant growth\
    \ and physiology, but it still reduced both marketable and total yield. In \n\
    2013 season, 75% ETc irrigation had little influence on plant growth, leaf characteristics,\
    \ photosynthetic rate, head fresh \nweight and size, but it temporarily increased\
    \ chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and decreased stomata conductance, \ntranspiration,\
    \ and marketable yield. Pennant, the green-head cultivar, had higher photosynthetic\
    \ rate, head fresh weight, \nmarketable and total yield than the red-head cultivar\
    \ Rio Grande. In both seasons, deficit irrigations did not influence \ncabbage\
    \ head dry weight, indicating that most yield reduction under deficit irrigations\
    \ is related to water content. \nKeywords: pigment; photosynthesis; relative water\
    \ content; specific leaf area\nThe Winter Garden region of south Texas is a \n\
    semiarid agricultural region with limited water \nresources. Cabbage is one of\
    \ the most important \ncole crops in this region, but it was also classified \n\
    as intermediately susceptible to water stress (Janes \n1950; Singh, Alderfer 1966;\
    \ Nortje, Henrico \n1988). Cabbage production during fall and winter \nmainly\
    \ depends on supplemental irrigation. There-\nfore, development of efficient and\
    \ economically vi-\nable irrigation management for effective use of lim-\nited\
    \ water resources is needed. \nCompared with furrow and basin irrigation, drip\
    \ \nirrigation is the most effective method to irrigate \nvegetable crops due\
    \ to water savings and yield \nincreases (Tiwari et al. 1998a,b; Xie et al. 1999;\
    \ \nTiwari et al. 2003). In addition, deficit irrigation \nstrategy, a practice\
    \ that deliberately allows crops to \nsustain some degree of water deficit with\
    \ marginal \nyield loss, has the potential to increase water use \nefficiency\
    \ and save water (Costa et al. 2007). It is \nexpected that deficit irrigation\
    \ would be adopted \nfor a wide variety of crops and in more regions, es-\npecially\
    \ in arid and semiarid climates of the world. \nHowever, leafy vegetables appear\
    \ less adapted to \ndeficit irrigation than fruit tree crops (Jones 2004; \nCosta\
    \ et al. 2007). A previous study indicated \nSupported by the National Institute\
    \ of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture under Agreement  \n\
    No. 2010-34461-20677. \nVol. 41, 2014, No. 3: 138–146 \nHort. Sci. (Prague)\n\
    \ \n139\nthat yield of cabbage was similar when irrigated at \n80 kPa and 160\
    \ kPa soil water tension, but reduced \nat 360 kPa (Thomas et al. 1970). Smittle\
    \ et al. \n(1994) found that cabbage yield was highest when \nirrigation was applied\
    \ at 25 kPa soil water tension, \nas compared to 50 or 75 kPa. Drew (1966) report-\n\
    ed higher cabbage yield with irrigation at 12.5% \nthan at 25, 50, or 75% available\
    \ soil moisture con-\ntent. Using sprinkler irrigation system, Sanchez et \nal.\
    \ (1994) found that cabbage production was op-\ntimized when crops were irrigated\
    \ for evapotran-\nspiration (ET) replacement while both deficit and \nexcess irrigation\
    \ reduced yield. However, Sammis \nand Wu (1989) reported that cabbage marketable\
    \ \nyield increased linearly with increased water appli-\ncation up to 49.3 t/ha.\
    \ Tiwari et al. (2003) found \nno significant yield difference in cabbage irrigated\
    \ \nat 100, 80 and 60% of crop ET (ETc) during three \nyears. Imtiyaz et al. (2000)\
    \ examined the effect \nof irrigation scheduling using 18 mm of water in \neach\
    \ irrigation when cumulative pan evaporation \nreached 11, 22, 33, 44 and 55 mm\
    \ and found that \nirrigation at 11 mm of cumulative pan evaporation \nhad the\
    \ highest cabbage yield. \nThe reports on deficit irrigation for cabbage \nproduction\
    \ have some discrepancies, which may \nbe related to differences in cultivar,\
    \ climate, soil \nconditions and irrigation method. Moreover, most \nresearch\
    \ on cabbage irrigation focused mainly on \nyield without accounting for the effects\
    \ on growth \nand physiology. The aim of this two-year study was \nto determine\
    \ the influence of deficit irrigation on \ncabbage growth, leaf characteristics,\
    \ pigment con-\ntent, gas exchange, head weight, size and yield.\nMATERIAL AND\
    \ METHODS\nExperiments were carried out in two seasons, \n2011–12 and 2012–13\
    \ (herein 2012 and 2013 sea-\nson, respectively) at the Texas AgriLife Research\
    \ \nCenter, Uvalde, Texas, USA (longigude 29°1'N, lati-\ntude 99°5'W, elevation\
    \ 283 m a.s.l.). The soil was silty \nclay (fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermic Aridic\
    \ Calcius-\ntolls) with an available soil moisture holding capaci-\nty of 17%.\
    \ Cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) was seeded \nwith a vacuum planter (MaterMacc,\
    \ San Vito al Tag-\nliamento, Italy) on 1.02 m wide bed with double lines \nspaced\
    \ at 0.23 m on November 24, 2011 (2012 sea-\nson), and November 30, 2012 (2013\
    \ season). The \ncultivar Pennant (green head) was used for the 2012 \nseason,\
    \ and Pennant and Rio Grande (red head) for \nthe 2013 season. Winter (November\
    \ to February) \ntemperatures for 2012 and 2013 seasons were gener-\nally similar\
    \ with average daily temperatures in the \nranges of 5 to 22°C. The main difference\
    \ between the \ntwo seasons was rainfall, which was 243 and 158 mm \nfor 2012\
    \ and 2013 season, respectively. In each sea-\nson seedlings were thinned at 0.3 m\
    \ between plants. \nSubsurface drip irrigation was installed in the cen-\ntre\
    \ of each bed at 10 cm depth. The irrigation rates \nwere 100, 75, and 50% ETc\
    \ for the 2012 season, and \n100 and 75% ETc for the 2013 season. The adjustment\
    \ \nof the deficit irrigation rate in 2013 was based on re-\nsults obtained in\
    \ 2012 season. The ETc values were \nestimated using weather data from a local\
    \ weather \nstation and the Penman-Monteith method, and the \napplication of stage-specific\
    \ crop coefficients (Al-\nlen et al. 1998). Total irrigation was 259, 218 and\
    \ \n182 mm for 100, 75 and 50% ETc irrigation in 2012 \nseason, and 515 and 416\
    \ mm for 100 and 75% ETc ir-\nrigation in 2013 season, respectively. Total fertilizers\
    \ \napplied as fertigation were 140 N-57 P-23 K kg/ha \nin 2012 season and 135\
    \ N-43 P-50 K kg/ha in 2013 \nseason.\nGrowth and physiological measurements.\
    \ \nPlant height, width and leaf chlorophyll index were \nperiodically measured\
    \ on five plants from each \nreplication throughout development at various \n\
    days after seeding (DAS). Leaf chlorophyll index \nwas measured in the first fully-developed\
    \ leaf with \na SPAD-502 meter (Konica Minolta Sensing Inc., \nTokyo, Japan).\
    \ During early, middle and late de-\nvelopment, leaf gas exchange (photosynthetic\
    \ rate, \nPn; stomatal conductance, gs; and transpiration, Tr) \nwas measured.\
    \ In addition, three plants from each \nreplication were sampled to determine\
    \ leaf area, \nfresh and dry weight (FW and DW), relative water \ncontent (RWC),\
    \ specific leaf area (SLA), and con-\ntent of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids.\
    \ \nLeaf area was measured with a leaf area me-\nter (Li-3000, Licor, Inc., Lincoln,\
    \ USA). For leaf \nchlorophyll and carotenoid content, six leaf discs \nwere taken\
    \ with a cork borer from three plants \nand soaked in 20 ml of 95% ethanol in\
    \ the dark for \n48 hours. The extraction was repeated twice with \n10 ml of 95%\
    \ ethanol each time. Absorbance of the \nextraction at 664, 649 and 470 nm was\
    \ measured \nwith a spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S, Thermo \nFisher Scientific,\
    \ Inc., Waltham, USA). Chlorophyll \na, b and carotenoid content was calculated\
    \ using \nthe formula described by Arnon (1949). Another \nsix leaf discs were\
    \ taken to determine leaf RWC \nand SLA. \nHort. Sci. (Prague) \nVol. 41, 2014,\
    \ No. 3: 138–146\n140 \nLeaf RWC was calculated using the formula: \n100[(FW −\
    \ DW)/(TW − DW)] \nwhere:\nFW  – fresh weigh (g)\nTW  – turgid weight following\
    \ soaking in water for 4 h \nat 4°C\nDW  – weight following oven-drying leaf samples\
    \ for \n72 h at 80°C\nGas exchange measurements were made on the \nlargest leaf\
    \ from three plants in each plot with a \nportable infrared gas analyser (Li-6400,\
    \ Licor, Inc.). \nThe analyser was set at 500 μmol/s flow rate (leaf \ntemperature\
    \ of 25 ± 0.4oC, 60 ± 5% relative humid-\nity) and a light emitting diode external\
    \ light source \nproviding a photosynthetic photon flux density of \n1,500 μmol/m2/s.\
    \ \nYield and yield components. Cabbage heads \nwere harvested at peak maturity\
    \ on May 17 in \n2012 season and May 13 in 2013 season. Heads \nwith defects or\
    \ initial flower stalk, or too small  \n(≤ 454 g) were defined as unmarketable.\
    \ Market-\nable and total yield (t/ha), average head size (width \nand height),\
    \ weight (g/head), and the ratio of head \nfresh and dry weight were determined.\
    \ \nStatistical analysis. The experiment for 2012 \nseason was conducted using\
    \ a completely rand-\nomized design with four replications. The experi-\nment\
    \ for 2013 season was conducted using a split \nplot design with four replications.\
    \ Irrigation treat-\nments were the main plots and cultivars the sub-\nplots.\
    \ Each replication consisted of four rows with \n7.6 m length. All growth and\
    \ physiological vari-\nables, yield and yield characteristics data were sub-\n\
    jected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS \n(SAS Institute Inc., 1993).\
    \ Mean differences among \nirrigation and cultivar were determined according \n\
    to the Tukey’s Studentized range test. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n2012 season\n\
    Plant size was temporarily reduced by 50% ETc \nirrigation as compared to 100%\
    \ ETc irrigation (Ta-\nble 1). Plant height was 39.8, 38.0 and 38.0 cm at \n105\
    \ DAS for 100, 75 and 50% ETc irrigation, respec-\ntively, and plant width was\
    \ 60.7, 58.7 and 55.0 cm at \n91 DAS for 100, 75 and 50% ETc irrigation, respec-\n\
    tively. Deficit irrigation at 75% ETc had no signifi-\ncant effect on plant size\
    \ as compared to 100% ETc \nirrigation. Reduced plant width at 105 DAS might \n\
    result from leaf senescence and wilt under tem-\nporary heat stress. Plant size\
    \ reduced at 133 DAS \nbecause the outer leaves senesced and dropped \nbefore\
    \ harvesting. Chlorophyll index slightly in-\ncreased under deficit irrigation\
    \ at 105 (P = 0.095) \nand 147 (P = 0.054) DAS. The index was 64.7, 67.6 \nand\
    \ 68.5  at 105 DAS and 80.0, 84.9 and 84.0 at \n147 DAS for 100, 75 and 50% ETc\
    \ irrigation, respec-\ntively. Leaf pigments content was also measured at  \n\
    63, 93 and 133 DAS. Both deficit irrigation rates \nhad no significant effect\
    \ on the content of chloro-\nphyll a, b and carotenoid based on either leaf area\
    \ \nor dry weight (data not shown). Deficit irrigation \nat 75% ETc had no significant\
    \ effect on chlorophyll \nindex as compared to 100% ETc irrigation.\nLeaf characteristics\
    \ were not affected by deficit \nirrigation rates during early development (63 DAS;\
    \ \ndata not shown). At 93 DAS, 50% ETc irrigation \nsignificantly reduced leaf\
    \ area per plant from \n4,859 to 4,147 cm2 while leaf FW, DW, RWC and \nTable\

    \ \n143\nno significant yield difference in cabbage among 100, \n80 and 60% ETc\
    \ irrigations was detected (Tiwari \net al. 2003). Also, yield of cabbage did\
    \ not decrease \nwhen irrigated at 80 kPa and 160 kPa soil water ten-\nsion, but\
    \ it reduced at 360 kPa (Thomas et al. 1970). \nThe inconsistency in yield response\
    \ might be due to \ndifferences in climate, soil conditions and irrigation \n\
    method. In this study, both marketable and total \nyield at 75 and 50% ETc deficit\
    \ irrigation were sig-\nnificantly reduced as compared to 100% ETc irriga-\ntion.\
    \ However, there were no significant differences \ndetected in dry weight of marketable\
    \ heads among \nthe irrigation treatments since deficit irrigations in-\ncreased\
    \ the dry weight percentage, which suggests \nthat most decreases in yield under\
    \ deficit irrigation \nare related to water content.\n2013 season\nOnly 75% ETc\
    \ irrigation was tested but on two cul-\ntivars (Pennant, green head colour and\
    \ Rio Grande, \nred head colour), since it had little effects on plant \ngrowth\
    \ and physiology during 2012 season. The in-\nteraction between irrigation and\
    \ cultivar was not \nsignificant so the data were pooled by cultivar. 75% \nETc\
    \ irrigation significantly reduced plant height at \n146 DAS but had no significant\
    \ effect on plant width \n(Table 5). Deficit irrigation increased chlorophyll\
    \ in-\ndex from 52.5 to 53.1 (P = 0.073) and 66.0 to 66.7 at \n83 and 111 DAS,\
    \ respectively (Table 6). Also leaf pig-\nment content based on dry weight was\
    \ enhanced by \ndeficit irrigation at 106 DAS (Table 7). Chlorophyll a, \nb, a\
    \ + b and caroteniod contents were 2.60, 0.94, 3.55 \nand 0.59 µg/mg DW at 100%\
    \ ETc irrigation as com-\npared to 2.97, 1.06, 4.02 and 0.64 µg/mg DW at 75% \n\
    ETc irrigation. At 129 DAS chlorophyll b content was \nslightly (P = 0.078) reduced\
    \ from 1.03 to 0.96 µg/mg \nDW by 75% ETc irrigation, which might result from\
    \ \nleaf senescence under drought stress. Mäkelä et al. \n(2000) also reported\
    \ that moderate drought stress \nincreased tomato leaf chlorophyll content. The\
    \ re-\nduced effect of deficit irrigation on pigment content \nduring 2012 season\
    \ might be due to the low irriga-\ntion differences between 100 and 75% ETc irrigation\
    \  \n(41 and 99 mm for 2012 and 2013 season, respec-\ntively).\nDeficit irrigation\
    \ affected leaf gas exchange before \nmaturity (115 DAS), but not during development\
    \ (90 \nDAS) and maturity (135 DAS). At 115 DAS deficit ir-\nrigation reduced\
    \ gs and Tr at 115 DAS, but had no \nsignificant effect on Pn (Table 8). Similarly,\
    \ 75% ETc \nirrigation did not affect Pn during 2012 season. \nLeaf characteristics\
    \ (leaf area, FW, DW, RWC and \nSLA) were measured at 85, 106 and 129 DAS but\
    \ \nhad little difference between 100 and 75% ETc ir-\nrigations (data not shown).\
    \ Marketable fresh yield \nsignificantly decreased under 75% ETc irrigation \n\
    although average head fresh weight and head size \n(height and width) were not\
    \ significantly influ-\nenced by deficit irrigation (Table 9). The reduced \n\
    marketable yield mainly resulted from increased \nTable 6. Effect of irrigation\

    \ than in cv. Pennant during most \nplant development (Table 6). Also, chlorophyll\
    \ a, b \nand total content based on dry weight were higher in \ncv. Rio Grande\
    \ than in cv. Pennant at 129 DAS (2.97 \nvs 2.27, 1.17 vs 0.81, 4.14 vs 3.08 µg/mg\
    \ DW, for chlo-\nrophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content, respec-\ntively)\
    \ (Table 7). However, cv. Pennant had signifi-\ncantly higher Pn and gs than cv.\
    \ Rio Grande at 90 and \n115 DAS (Table 8). High chlorophyll content does \nnot\
    \ necessarily result in high photosynthesis since \nit is also affected by other\
    \ factors such as stomatal \nand metabolic limitations. There were no significant\
    \ \ndifferences between cultivars in leaf area, FW, DW, \nRWC and SLA (data not\
    \ shown). At harvesting the \naverage head fresh weight of cv. Pennant was higher\
    \ \nthan that of cv. Rio Grande (1.63 vs. 1.33 g) and cv. \nPennant had higher\
    \ marketable (92 vs. 62 t/ha) and \ntotal yield (94 vs. 76 t/ha) than cv. Rio\
    \ Grande (Ta-\nble 9), which resulted from high photosynthetic rate \nin cv. Pennant.\n\
    CONCLUSION\nDeficit irrigation at 75% ETc had little influence \non plant size,\
    \ leaf pigment content, leaf character-\nistics, leaf gas exchange, head weight\
    \ and size, ex-\ncept for a moderate reduction in marketable yield. \nHowever,\
    \ dry weight of marketable heads was not \nsignificantly different between 100\
    \ and 75% ETc ir-\nrigation. Since dry weight percentage increased un-\nder deficit\
    \ irrigation, it suggests that most yield re-\nduction under deficit irrigation\
    \ is related to water \ncontent. Implementing deficit irrigation (75% ETc) \n\
    could save water (16%) although a moderate de-\ncrease in yield (12%) and head\
    \ size is expected.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Juan Esquivel,\

    Modeling contribution of shallow \ngroundwater to evapotranspiration \nand yield\
    \ of maize in an arid area\nXiaoyu Gao1,2, Zailin Huo1, Zhongyi Qu3, Xu Xu1, Guanhua\
    \ Huang1 & Tammo S. Steenhuis2\nCapillary rise from shallow groundwater can decrease\
    \ the need for irrigation water. However, simple \ntechniques do not exist to\
    \ quantify the contribution of capillary flux to crop water use. In this study\
    \ \nwe develop the Agricultural Water Productivity Model for Shallow Groundwater\
    \ (AWPM-SG) for \ncalculating capillary fluxes from shallow groundwater using\
    \ readily available data. The model combines \nan analytical solution of upward\
    \ flux from groundwater with the EPIC crop growth model. AWPM-SG \nwas calibrated\
    \ and validated with 2-year lysimetric experiment with maize. Predicted soil moisture,\
    \ \ngroundwater depth and leaf area index agreed with the observations. To investigate\
    \ the response \nof model, various scenarios were run in which the irrigation\
    \ amount and groundwater depth were \nvaried. Simulations shows that at groundwater\
    \ depth of 1 m capillary upward supplied 41% of the \nevapotranspiration. This\
    \ reduced to 6% at groundwater depth of 2 m. The yield per unit water consumed\
    \ \n(water productivity) was nearly constant for 2.3 kg/m3. The yield per unit\
    \ water applied (irrigation water \nproductivity) increased with decreasing irrigation\
    \ water because capillary rise made up in part for the \nlack of irrigation water.\
    \ Consequently, using AWPM-SG in irrigation scheduling will be beneficial to save\
    \ \nmore water in areas with shallow groundwater.\nIn many of semi-arid and arid\
    \ regions of the world, irrigated agriculture consumes most of the water. For\
    \ exam-\nple, in the 1.12 million ha Hetao irrigation district in the Yellow River\
    \ basin, agricultural irrigation accounts for \n90% of the water use1,2. Especially\
    \ in districts with shallow groundwater such as the Hetao Irrigation district,\
    \ \ncapillary rise of groundwater can be used to supplement surface water irrigation\
    \ and in closed basins can possibly \nsave water for irrigating additional areas.\n\
    Several experiments have been carried out to quantify the amount of water that\
    \ is used by agricultural crops \nfrom groundwater. Bargahei and Mosavi reported\
    \ in an experimental study, groundwater supplemented between \n53% and 55% of\
    \ the water of safflower utilizing saline groundwater and about 82% for safflower\
    \ utilized fresh \ngroundwater at groundwater depths (between 50 cm to 120 cm)3.\
    \ Ghamarnia found that two thirds of the aver-\nage annual safflower water requirement\
    \ (65 cm) could be met with groundwater table depth from 0.6 to 0.8 m4. \nWith\
    \ lysimeter experiments, Kahlown and Ashraf reported that the wheat crop did not\
    \ need any supplementary \nirrigation with a water table at 0.5 m depth and 80%\
    \ sunflower’s water need was supplied by groundwater at 0.5 m \ndepth5.\nYield,\
    \ water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) vary with both\
    \ groundwater depth \nand irrigation amounts. Mejia et al. conducted a two-year\
    \ study to investigate the effect of groundwater table on \nthe yield of corn\
    \ and found a 5–10% greater yield for corn and 23% for soybeans at 0.5–0.75 m\
    \ groundwater depth \ncompared with the same treatment with groundwater depth\
    \ more than 1 m6. Huo et al. reported that irrigation \nwater productivity (IWP)\
    \ increased with the shallower groundwater tables7.\nAlthough experimental evidence\
    \ has well established that the shallow groundwater can supplement crop water\
    \ \nuse, it is seldom used in irrigation scheduling to decrease the amount of\
    \ water applied because measuring the \ncapillary upward flux is complex and cannot\
    \ be done routinely. Therefore, models are the only way to obtain the \nfluxes.\
    \ However, most of the irrigation management models assume that the groundwater\
    \ is sufficient deep that \nthe water percolates downward out reach of the plant\
    \ roots8–10. Several methods that can estimate the upward \nwater such as Hydrus\
    \ and SWAP are cumbersome because they require spatially varying input data such\

    \ of this manuscript is, therefore, to develop a quantitative model requiring\

    \ and to investigate the effect of groundwater depth and irrigation water amount\
    \ on \nyield, crop evapotranspiration, water productivity and irrigation water\
    \ productivity of maize. Without affecting \nthe maize yield, the irrigation water\
    \ can be reduced in a reasonable range. This will aid managers in optimizing \n\
    water application rates to optimize yields and to determine diversion plans from\
    \ river systems.\nModel Description\nAgricultural Water Productivity Model for\
    \ Shallow Groundwater. \nIn this study, we develop the \nAgricultural Water Productivity\
    \ Model for Shallow Groundwater, AWPM-SG, which is coupling of a crop \ngrowth\
    \ model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) and a soil moisture model\
    \ of root and vadose \nzone -WIPE (Watershed Irrigation Potential Estimation)\
    \ that simulates both upward movement from ground-\nwater and percolation to the\
    \ groundwater which was originally developed by Saleh et al. for surface irrigation\
    \ in \nBangladesh15,16. The structure of AWPM-SG model is shown in Fig. 1. AWPM-SG\
    \ model needs few parameters \n(soil hydraulic parameters and crop growing parameters)\
    \ listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3 in the \nSection S3 of the Supplementary material\
    \ and simulates water flux on daily time step. The three parts of the \nAWPM-SG\
    \ model consists of a crop module, an actual evapotranspiration module and a soil\
    \ module (Figure S1 \ndrawn by Xiaoyu Gao in the Section S2 of the Supplementary material).\
    \ These three modules are coupled first \ntime in the AWPM-SG model. The model\
    \ is described in detail in the Section S1 of the Supplementary material. \nAn\
    \ overview of AWPM-SG model is given below.\nCrop module. The crop module of AWPM-SG\
    \ is mainly based on the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate \n(EPIC) model.\
    \ EPIC originally developed by Williams et al.17. It has been tested and applied\
    \ widely around the \nworld18–22. Wang and Li reported that the EPIC model predicted\
    \ winter wheat and spring maize yield well on the \nLoess Plateau in China23.\
    \ Niu et al. examined the reliability of the EPIC model in simulating the grain\
    \ sorghum \nyields in the USA and found that the accuracy and reliability varied\
    \ with climate classes and nitrogen treat-\nments24. Brown and Rosenberg validated\
    \ the EPIC model to assess the climate change impact on the potential \nproductivity\
    \ of corn and wheat in the U.S.25. Currently the EPIC model has evolved into a\
    \ comprehensive model \ncapable of simulating photosynthesis, evapotranspiration\
    \ and other major plant and soil process23. The crop mod-\nule includes the phonological\
    \ development, crop growth indexes (LAI, biomass, root growing, crop yield) and\
    \ \nwater productivity (WP, IWP).\nDescription of soil module. Because EPIC cannot\
    \ simulate the crop growth above the ground without the soil \ndata, EPIC was\
    \ coupled with the modified watershed irrigation potential estimation model (WIPE)\
    \ to simulate \nthe whole water recycle. The WIPE model was designed by Saleh\
    \ et al. to study the impact of irrigation manage-\nment schemes on groundwater\
    \ levels in Bangladesh16. The model divides the soil profile into four zones namely\

    \ and the saturated zone as shown in Figure S1 in the \nSection S2 of the Supplementary material\
    \ 16. The soil texture in zone 1 and 2 are same. The zone 1 is calculated \nusing\
    \ the water balance method. The WIPE model simulates both downward recharge when\
    \ the soil moisture in \nzone 2 is greater than field capacity and upward movement\
    \ when the soil moisture is below field capacity using an \nanalytical solution\
    \ developed by Gardner26. This is a one-dimensional model employing the Thornthwaite-Mather\
    \ \nprocedure to calculate the recharge below the root zone to the aquifer and\
    \ is primarily applicable to shallow aqui-\nfers27. Steenhuis and van der Molen\
    \ successfully used this model on Long Island, NewYork, USA. Other studies \n\
    also employed Thornthwaite-Mather procedure28–30.\nFull detail of the model is\
    \ shown in the Section S1 (Agricultural Water Productivity Model for Shallow \n\
    Groundwater) of the Supplementary material.\nActual evapotranspiration module.\
    \ Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is an input to the EPIC model. We used the \n\
    model of Kendy et al. that previously was able to calculate the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ from soil-water storage \nin North China Plain with good accuracy9. In this\
    \ model, the ratio of Ep to Tp depends upon the development \nstage of the leaf\
    \ canopy, moisture content and root development9,31–34. The input data are the\
    \ daily leaf area index, \nLAI simulated by the EPIC model and simulated soil\
    \ moisture of actual root zone (zone 1) by WIPE model and \nwater balance.\nResults\n\
    Evaluation of AWPM-SG model. \nData of a lysimetric experimental study carried\
    \ in 2007 and 2008 at the \nShuguang experimental station in the Hetao irrigation\
    \ district, were used to calibrate and validate the AWPM-SG \nmodel. The maize\
    \ (Kehe-8) commonly grown in Hetao irrigation district was planted in late April\
    \ and harvested \nin late September. Supplementary Table S4 in the Section S3\
    \ of the Supplementary material shows the irrigation \nscheduling with four times\
    \ irrigation every year. Experiments were carried out in two replicates. The groundwater\
    \ \ndepths were set using the Marriotte bottles at 1.5 m, 2 m, 2.5 m and 3 m before\
    \ planting. After planting the bottles \nwere removed allowing the groundwater\
    \ to vary in response to irrigation and evaporation.\nThe 2007 data were used\
    \ for calibration and 2008 data for validation (Tables S2 and S3 in the Section\
    \ S3 of the \nSupplementary material). The soil data and crop data inputted are\
    \ shown in Tables S2 and S3 in the Section S3 \nof the Supplementary material.\
    \ The goodness of fit test can be found in Table 1 and Table S5 in the Section\
    \ S3 of \nthe Supplementary material. In case where the observed data were remained\
    \ nearly the same during the growing \nseason such as the deeper groundwater depth,\

    \ and validation. The soil water content of top 90 cm (zones 1 and 2) was used\
    \ to cali-\nbrate and validate the model. Simulated mean soil water content in\

    \ To investigate the effect of calibrated parameters on the crop \nevapotranspiration,\
    \ groundwater depth, LAI and soil water content of 90 cm soil, the parameters\
    \ sensitivity and \nuncertainty were analyzed together (Figure S2). When the parameters\
    \ vary, the four indexes are linearly related to \nthe change in the parameters\
    \ basically except for the Tb, PHU and C. For the crop evapotranspiration, the\
    \ LAImx \naffects the ET most obviously, and then the be and Tb largely affect\
    \ the ET (Figure S2A and B). The other param-\neters affect the ET slightly with\
    \ the Δ ET/ET less than 5% as the parameters increasing by 25%. Evenly most of\
    \ \nthe parameters have little impact on the ET. The initial LAImx is from the\
    \ recommended value of EPIC. Through \nthe calibration and sensitivity of parameters\
    \ the final LAI is determined. The detailed information is shown in \nFigure S2\
    \ in the Section S2 of Supplementary material.\nFor the groundwater depth, the\
    \ mf, dp, Tb and PHU are the main impact factors. The others almost have \nno\
    \ influence on the groundwater depth (Figure S2C and D). mf is measured in the\
    \ field experiment using \nundisturbed samples. The initial dp is obtained by\
    \ the recommended value of local government and Tb, PHU is \nobtained by the recommended\
    \ value of EPIC. The detailed information is shown in Figure S2 in the Section\
    \ S2 of \nSupplementary material.\nSimilarly to the ET, the main impact factors\
    \ on LAI are LAImx, Tb, PHU, T0 and ad. The other parameters have \nlittle effect\
    \ on the LAI. The initial Tb, PHU, T0 and ad are recommended by EPIC. The detailed\
    \ information is \nshown in Figure S2 in the Section S2 of Supplementary material.\n\
    For the soil water content of 90 cm, the parameters such as mf, ms, mwp, LAImx,\
    \ PHU, Tb affect the soil water \ncontent more obviously than the other parameters.\
    \ Mf, ms, mwp are measured in the experiment. The initial \nLAImx, PHU, Tb are\
    \ recommended by EPIC. The detailed information is shown in Figure S2 in the Section\
    \ S2 of \nSupplementary material.\nCombing the observed data, the uncertainty\
    \ analysis of the parameters on groundwater depth, LAI and soil \nwater content\
    \ are analyzed (Table S6 in the Section S3 of Supplementary material). Through\
    \ the uncertainty \nanalysis of parameters, the d-factors calculated by Equation (7)\
    \ ranges from 0 to 1.44 with averaged value of 0.14. \nLarger d-factor represents\
    \ larger uncertainty. From the data, we can find that for the groundwater depth,\
    \ LAI and \nsoil water content, the most uncertain parameters are same with the\
    \ most sensitive parameter. The most uncer-\ntain parameters are mf, LAImx, mf\
    \ for groundwater depth, LAI and soil water content, respectively. The trend of\
    \ \nuncertainty of parameters are basically similar to the sensitivity. The detailed\
    \ information is shown in Table S6 in \nthe Section S3 of Supplementary material.\n\
    Water fluxes and capillary rise under different groundwater depths. In this model\
    \ the water flux at the boundary \nof zone 2 (RD <   =  RDmx) or zone 1 (RD =\
    \  RDmx) is the water flux at water table. In this model we assume the \nwater\
    \ flux at 90 cm (maximum root) as the groundwater contribution to crop water use.\
    \ In the analysis, ground-\nwater depth is the initial groundwater condition for\
    \ different groundwater depth. The soil water flux obtained by \nadding the percolation\
    \ (calculated with Equation S23 in the Section S1 of Supplementary material) and\
    \ capillary \nrise (Equation S24 in the Section S1 of Supplementary material)\
    \ during the growing period from April 20th to \nSeptember 24th for 2007 for groundwater\
    \ tables from 150 to 300 cm are shown in Figure S3 in the Section S2 of \nthe\
    \ Supplementary material. There were eighteen recharge events for 150 cm groundwater\
    \ depth and only four \nwhen the groundwater was at 2 m or deeper. The root zone\
    \ is wetter when the groundwater is shallow (Fig. 2A) \nand the soil is brought\
    \ up to field capacity faster than when the groundwater is deeper. Assuming that\
    \ all irri-\ngation or rain water in excess of field capacity percolates downward,\
    \ this means that there is more recharge for \nthe shallow groundwater tables.\
    \ For example, with the irrigation of 9.75 cm irrigation on June 26th in 2007,\
    \ the \ngroundwater table rose 53 cm for the 150 cm depth and 1 cm for water table\
    \ at 300 cm (Figure S3 in the Section S2 \nof the Supplementary material). Without\
    \ the rainfall and irrigation, water from groundwater will move upward \nto the\
    \ root zone. The net groundwater contribution (i.e., upward minus recharge) to\
    \ soil root zone for whole \ncrop growth stage was 106 mm (24%) when groundwater\
    \ depth was at 1.5 m, while recharges was 51 mm with \ngroundwater depth of 3\
    \ m. Our modeling results are similar to Huo et al., where the groundwater capillary\
    \ flow \ncomprised 29% of the water use of wheat at 1.5 m groundwater depth from\
    \ planting to harvest and decreased with \nan increase in table depth7.\nScenarios\
    \ for evaluation of water use and yield. \nAfter calibration and validation of\
    \ AWPM-SG, the \nmodel was used to find out the response of groundwater depth\
    \ and deficit irrigation on water use, maize yield, \nWP and IWP. To do so the\
    \ AWPM-SG was run for nine scenarios with 7 GWD levels (100, 150, 200, 250, 300,\
    \ \n350 and 400 cm). D0 (irrigation with 360 mm, 53% of PET), D1 (irrigation with\
    \ 288 mm, 42% of PET), D2 (irri-\ngation with 270 mm, 40% of PET), D3 (irrigation\
    \ with 240 mm, 35% of PET), D4 (irrigation with 180 mm, 26% \nof PET), D5 (irrigation\
    \ with 120 mm, 18% of PET), D6 (irrigation with 90 mm, 13% of PET), D7 (irrigation\
    \ with \n72 mm, 11% of PET) and D8 (no irrigation) were simulated (Table 2). The\
    \ rainfall of 128 mm for all scenarios \nand the irrigation for the D0 treatment\
    \ was similar to the amount in 2007 used for calibration of the model. The \n\
    initial soil water, groundwater depth, irrigation time and fertilizer application\
    \ are set as the lysimeter experiments \nof groundwater at 1.5 m in 2007. The\
    \ initial meteorology of the model is done by repeated meteorology in the \nexperiments\
    \ in 2007. In the analysis for the effect of groundwater on water flux, evapotranspiration\
    \ and yield, \ngroundwater depth is the initial groundwater condition for different\
    \ scenarios.\nEvapotranspiration of maize. The scenario analysis found that evapotranspiration\
    \ (calculated by Equation S32 \nin the Section S1 of the Supplementary material)\
    \ was the greatest for the shallowest groundwater depth at 1 m \namounted to around\
    \ 570 mm per growing season and was nearly independent of the amount of irrigation\

    \ DOI: 10.1038/srep43122\napplied (Fig. 3). The initial soil moisture content\
    \ was 0.3 cm3/cm3 and rainfall during the growing season was \n128 mm for the\
    \ all scenarios. Evapotranspiration decreased gradually when the groundwater depth\
    \ increased \nfrom 1 to 4 m depth. For groundwater depth of 1 m, the evapotranspiration\
    \ was around 550 mm independent of \nthe amount of irrigation applied. When the\
    \ groundwater is at 4 m, less water evaporated when irrigation amounts \ndecreased\
    \ and amounted to 300 mm per growing season when the groundwater was at 4 m depth\
    \ and the maize \ncrop was not irrigated (Fig. 3).\nThe groundwater contribution\
    \ to crop evapotranspiration (WF/ET). The predicted water flux at water table\
    \ for \nvarious irrigation treatments and groundwater depths are shown in Fig. 4A.\
    \ Within the crop growth period, root \nzone will become deeper. At the same time,\
    \ groundwater levels will change. So flux between groundwater and \nroot zone\
    \ is dynamic and depend on distance between water table and the rooting depth.\
    \ For the same ground-\nwater depth, the upward water flux increases as the irrigation\
    \ amount becomes smaller, especially for the shallow \ngroundwater depth (Fig. 4A).\
    \ For example, at 1 m groundwater depth, the upward water flux was 202 mm without\
    \ \nirrigation and nearly half of the amount evapotranspirated. The result show\
    \ that under shallow groundwater, \ngroundwater contribution can be considered\
    \ in the irrigation system. When the groundwater table was at 2 m \ndepth, there\
    \ was a net recharge of − 14 mm in the growing season when 360 mm of irrigation\
    \ water was applied \n(Fig. 4A) and without irrigation there was a 23 mm of upward\

    \ Equation S10 in the Section S1 of the Supplementary material) is almost unaffected\
    \ when the groundwater \nis shallow depths with more irrigation water applied\
    \ (Table 3). For example, for the D0 treatment (irrigation at \n53% of PET with\
    \ 360 mm), the yield of maize is 12.44 tons/ha for groundwater at 1 m depth and\
    \ 12.42 tons/ha for \ngroundwater at 4 m depth. However, when groundwater is more\
    \ than 2 m deep irrigation amounts are directly \nrelated to the crop yield. Without\
    \ irrigation, the yield was 12.42 tons/ha with groundwater at 1 m water table\
    \ \ndepth but reduced by approximately 1/2 to 7.0 tons/ha for groundwater at 4\
    \ m depth (Table 3).\nWater productivity and irrigation water productivity. Water\
    \ productivity (WP) (calculated with Equation S12 \nin the Section S1 of the Supplementary material)\
    \ is the ratio of crop yield to crop evapotranspiration. Irrigation \nwater productivity\
    \ (IWP) (calculated with Equation S13 in the Section S1 of the Supplementary material)\
    \ is the \nratio of crop yield to irrigation amount (Table 3). The WP is nearly\
    \ constant for all irrigation amounts and all \ngroundwater depth and thus the\
    \ yield is directly related to the amount of evapotranspiration. It should however\
    \ \nbe noted that this is only true for deficit irrigation where less irrigation\
    \ water is applied than the potential evap-\notranspiration during the summer.\
    \ The WP is increasing slightly with less irrigation at the same groundwater \n\
    depth. For the same irrigation application with more than 180 mm, WP is increasing\
    \ with deeper groundwater.\nThe IWP increased with decreasing water application\
    \ (Table 3, Fig. 5). The averaged IWP value for seven \ngroundwater levels for\
    \ the D0 (irrigation at 53% of PET), D2 (irrigation at 40% of PET), D4 (irrigation\
    \ at 26% of \nPET) and D6 (irrigation at 13% of PET) irrigation treatments were\
    \ 3.4, 4.5, 6.5 and 11.8 kg/m3. This clearly shows \nthe positive effect of water\
    \ table depth on maize yield.\nDiscussion\nIn order to simulate the irrigation\
    \ water management models in arid areas with shallow groundwater, the \nAgricultural\
    \ Water Productivity Model for Shallow Groundwater (AWPM-SG) (Fig. 1) was developed\
    \ for the \nsimulation of the water fluxes, deep percolation and capillary rise\
    \ as a function of groundwater depth. The model \nneeds few parameters (soil hydraulic\
    \ parameters and crop growing parameters) and simulates water flux on daily \n\
    time step. The model was calibrated and validated using the lysimeter experimental\
    \ data in 2007 and 2008. The \nsimulation of soil moisture, groundwater depth\
    \ and LAI resulted in reasonable agreement, which indicated that \nthe model is\
    \ suitable to simulate water fluxes and water productivity in the shallow groundwater\
    \ district.\nThe water flux at water table, crop evapotranspiration and groundwater\
    \ contribution were investi-\ngated with running AWPM-SG in scenarios where the\
    \ irrigation amount and water table depth was varied. \nEvapotranspiration was\
    \ nearly independent of the amount of water applied when the groundwater was shallow\
    \ \nand for groundwater below 1.5 m decreased with smaller amounts of irrigation\
    \ water (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Thus \nFigure 4. Water fluxes at water table and\
    \ groundwater contribution to water use (WF/ET) under various \ngroundwater depths\
    \ and irrigation amounts. Note: A is that water fluxes at water table; B is that\
    \ groundwater \ncontribution to water use (WF/ET); GWD is groundwater depth; Irrigation\
    \ is the total amount of irrigation \napplied during the growing season. Individual\
    \ irrigation amounts are listed in Table 2. WF is the net water flux \nat water\
    \ table, ET is the actual evapotranspiration.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\
    8\nScIentIfIc RePoRTS | 7:43122 | DOI: 10.1038/srep43122\nthe capillary rise can\
    \ make up for the lack of irrigation water. This is agreement of the findings\
    \ of Soppe and \nAyars35, the irrigation applied was 46% less when the water table\
    \ was maintained at 1.5 m depth than when the \nwater table was too deep to be\
    \ reached by the crops, while our results are that ET only decreased by 3% with\
    \ irri-\ngation applied 50% less at 0.5 m water table depth when ET decreased\
    \ by 9% with irrigation applied 50% less at \n3 m water table depth (Fig. 3).\n\
    We found that the quotient of groundwater flux at water table (WF) and the evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) increases \nwith both decrease in irrigation amounts and groundwater depth\
    \ (Fig. 4B). This is similar to the findings of Luo \nand Sophocleous that ratios\
    \ of seasonal groundwater evaporation to seasonal potential evapotranspiration\
    \ are \nplotted against the depth to water table36. Our results (Fig. 4) are in\
    \ general agreement with experimental results \nof Torres and Hanks and Luo and\
    \ Sophocleous that up to 2.5 m depth of groundwater table upwards movement \n\
    occurs and for deeper depth the groundwater contribution is almost negligible36,37.\

    Sophocleous’s experiments in the sub-humid warm temperate continental monsoon\
    \ Yucheng, China, only 3% of \nthe evapotranspiration was supplied by groundwater\
    \ at 3 m depth36.\nUnder deficit irrigation, maize yield is directly linked to\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (i.e. WP ≈  2.2) and almost \nindependent of the amount\
    \ of irrigation applied for shallow groundwater tables (Table 3). Consequently,\
    \ using \nAWPM-SG in irrigation scheduling together with groundwater monitoring\
    \ will increase the yield per unit of \nwater applied in irrigation district with\
    \ high groundwater. The IWP of maize slightly decreased when groundwa-\nter depth\
    \ increased with linear relationship and significantly increased with less irrigation\
    \ amount (Fig. 5). Thus, \nthese simulations agree with earlier findings of Huo\
    \ et al. and Sun et al.7,38, the amount of water productivity per \nunit of water\
    \ applied for shallow groundwater can be improved with moderate deficit irrigation.\
    \ In addition, the \ndeeper the groundwater level, the WP will be more different\
    \ between different irrigation treatments. For closed \nbasin where the amount\
    \ of irrigation water is limiting, applying less water will increase the overall\
    \ yield per unit \narea in the basin.\nFuture improvement to the model will include\
    \ modules that can simulate other crops. In addition, we will add \na module that\
    \ simulates the movement of salt so that irrigation manager can more effectively\

    Get rights and content Abstract The impact of different irrigation scheduling
    regimes on the quantity and quality of olive oil from a low-density olive grove
    in southern Portugal was assessed during the irrigation seasons of 2006 and 2007.
    Olive trees were subjected to one of the following treatments: A—full irrigation;
    B—sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) with 60% of ETc water applied with irrigation;
    C—regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with irrigation water applied at three critical
    phases: before flowering, at the beginning of pit hardening and before crop harvesting
    and D—rain-fed treatment. Olive oil yield was significantly higher than rain-fed
    conditions in 2006, an “on year” of significant rainfall during summer. No significant
    yield differences were observed in the following “off year”. Among the irrigated
    treatments, olive oil production of treatment B was 32.5% and 40.1% higher in
    2006 and 2007, respectively than the fully irrigated treatment A, despite receiving
    49% less irrigation water. Such strategy could allow for an efficient use of water
    in the region, of very limited available resources, and for modest but important
    oil yield increase. Nonetheless, on the “on year” of 2006 treatment C used 13.9%
    of the water applied to treatment B and produced only 23.9% less olive fruits
    which could also make it illegible as the next possible strategy to use for irrigating
    olive trees in the region, provided that water is secured latter in the summer,
    a period of vital importance for oil accumulation and very sensitive to water
    stress as the poor results of 2007 revealed. The different treatment water regimes
    did not impact on the chemical characteristics of olive oils that were within
    the set threshold limits. Similarly, the sensory characteristics of the olive
    oils as well as bitterness and pungency were negligible for all treatments allowing
    them to be assessed as of “superior quality”.Overall, irrigation treatments had
    no influence on the commercial value of produced oils, being all classified as
    “extra virgin”. Such funding may be of vital importance to farmers willing to
    further their irrigation area, save water and still retain the protected designation
    of origin (PDO) seal of quality for their oil. Previous article in issue Next

    Introduction According to the International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) the world
    area devoted to olive-growing is 8.8 Mha (Carbot, 2007). This area is centered
    mainly in the Mediterranean basin, which has about 99% of the world''s olive groves
    and produced in 2007/2008 around 2 030 800 metric tons of olive oil. In Europe,
    Portugal is the fourth largest olive oil producer, with 34 900 metric tons of
    olive oil produced in 2007/2008, mostly from its Southern Alentejo province where
    olive is a strategic crop providing for safe economic returns to farmers and jobs
    to entire rural communities. According to the latest agricultural census (INE,
    1999) the olive tree cultivation area in the southern province of Alentejo is
    around 148 402 and 37 298 ha in its sub-region of Moura, where the dry-farmed
    cultivars Cordovil, Verdeal and Galega are traditionally grown in orchards of
    around 100 trees ha−1. Due to the characteristically infrequent and limited annual
    rainfall of the region, there is a growing interest in improving the water use
    and oil content of those olive tree orchards through irrigation, if proven to
    be important in yield increases and better fruit quality. The cultivar Cordovil
    is highly appreciated for its high fruit free fatty acid (oleic acid) content
    and the fine sensory properties of extracted oil. It is mainly responsible for
    the seal of quality “Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)” conferred to the olive
    oil coming from the region (CE, 2006); the result of a balanced blend of 35–40%
    Cordovil, 15–20% Verdeal and Galega oils, making the region of Moura in Alentejo
    one of the five protected designation of origin (PDO) regions of Portugal. Being
    olive-growing an integral part of the social fabric of the rural communities and
    one that provides safe economic returns to farmers, there is ambition among the
    olive growers to convert their traditional low-density olive groves into irrigation,
    a process that is already taking place. Also, with consumers demanding better
    quality olive oil and more perceptive about olive oil quality, the fine and distinct
    characteristics of those mono-variety oils from low-density autochthones cultivars
    are assuming a special relevance in the marketplace, as producers seek to find
    market niches for their low-producing but highly appreciated olive oil. Dry-farmed
    cv. Cordovil orchards are traditionally widely spaced to take full advantage of
    the stored water from winter rains for spring and summer growth. Yields are however
    low (Santos et al., 2007). To improve yields, compete with newly introduced and
    productive non-indigenous cultivars and preserve biodiversity and the character
    of the local oil, they are being converted to drip irrigation. Imposed often by
    the severe low water availability in the region, deficit irrigation management
    is being advocated as a way out to better yields, oil quality and economic returns
    of the irrigated orchards. Because of the large range of summer rainfall, microclimate,
    soils and tree spacing in the olive-growing areas, water requirements and the
    strategies used to manage olive trees vary widely. The literature contains few
    results on the irrigation of traditional, low-density olive orchards. Lavee et
    al. (1990) showed that a single complementary irrigation of 75 mm following pit
    hardening was effective in doubling olive production and oil yield in old olive
    trees of cv. Souri, when compared to rain-fed conditions. Pastor et al. (1999)
    reported an increase in yield in an 80 ha irrigated olive orchard compared to
    growth under rain-fed conditions. In a low-density olive orchard of 69 trees ha−1
    Moriana et al. (2007) showed that the trees in the water deficit and rain-fed
    treatments rapidly recovered from water stress after receiving irrigation water
    or autumn rainwater, suggesting that since recovery from water stress is rapid
    when irrigation is concentrated in the second half of the summer, this irrigation
    strategy could allow efficient use of water in areas of limited available resources.
    The current trend in the irrigation of olive trees is to develop either sustained
    (SDI) or regulated deficit (RDI) irrigation strategies, whereby the water is applied
    at a rate less than the needs of evapotranspiration with only very small reductions
    in yield (Goldhamer, 1999, Tognetti et al., 2005). SDI applies a fixed fraction
    of the evapotranspiration rate throughout the irrigation season while RDI imposes
    a period of water stress that is controlled in terms of its intensity. The second
    phase of fruit development, when pit hardening occurs, has been identified as
    the most resistant to water deficit, which is when water supplies can either be
    reduced or halted (Goldhamer, 1999). The third phase of fruit development and
    oil accumulation, after pit hardening, is however very sensitive to water stress
    (Lavee and Wodner, 1991, Goldhamer et al., 1994, Moriana et al., 2003, Tognetti
    et al., 2005), being found to reduce fruit and oil production. Results and sensitivity
    of both SDI and RDI on low-density orchards also show that outcome vary considerably
    by genotype, summer rainfall and related local environmental conditions. Water
    use strategies on irrigation of olive trees are often affected by changes in environmental
    water status, radiation and temperature that markedly impact on their seasonal
    physiological characteristics and oil. Stomata close slowly as water deficit increases
    so that the photosynthetic rate can be maintained over a wide range of leaf water
    potential, and the stomatal response to vapour pressure deficit is attenuated
    in highly stressed plants (Fernández et al., 1997, Moriana et al., 2003, Moriana
    et al., 2007). A successful programme to irrigate low-density olive orchards seems
    to require and depend on knowledge of trees physiological responses and sensitivity
    to different irrigation strategies at different stages of their growth cycle.
    Also, according to Motilva et al. (2000), regimes of water stress may impact on
    oil characteristics and quality. Patumi et al. (1999) and d’Andria (2008) in studies
    conducted on Italian olive varieties concluded that applications of water in excess
    of 66% ETc during the whole season neither led to increases in production nor
    to better fruit quality, a clear indication of the benefits of deficit irrigation
    regimes. d’Andria et al. (2004) had shown that the production and quality of olive
    fruit of five studied cultivars benefited from deficit irrigation and had high
    yield when only 66% of ETc was supplied with irrigation. Grattan et al. (2006),
    in a study carried out on high-density olive trees of cv. Arbequina I-18 in California
    reported maximum productivity when 75% of ETc was supplied with irrigation. They
    argued that the best oil chemical quality is obtained from irrigation regimes
    supplying 33–40% of ETc water. Moriana et al. (2007) in a study conducted on low-density
    olive trees subjected to one of four treatments: rain-fed, 100% ETc, 125% ETc
    and a deficit irrigation treatment with 60 mm of water, obtained no significant
    statistical differences between treatments for fruit yield or oil production.
    However, Grattan et al. (2006) report that increases in yield due to irrigation
    water application can be largely offset by reductions in the percent of oil extracted.
    Concerning oil quality, Patumi et al., 1999, Patumi et al., 2002 found fatty oils,
    acid composition, peroxide levels and shelf life not being affected by the amount
    of irrigation. Conversely, Gómez-Rico et al. (2005) report that oils of trees
    that undergo regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) regimes are of superior quality
    but similar in composition to ones under fully irrigated regimes. They argue that
    olive oil bitterness, spiciness and fruitiness are affected by irrigation, with
    a slight but more noticeable decrease in bitterness with increases in water application.
    Similarly, Muñoz-Cobo (2005) reports oils from highly irrigated olive trees been
    milder in sensory characteristics than counterpart oils from deficit irrigation
    regimes. Definitive conclusions and consensus on the behaviour of yield and olive
    oil characteristics of low-density orchard subjected to different irrigation regimes
    are hard to establish, making the issue an on-going and debatable matter needing
    ever more site specific studies and research. Certainly, capturing the specific
    effects of regional and local climates, soils and indigenous olive trees genotypes
    on yields and oil quality under different irrigation regimes is of importance
    to all olive researchers and technicians. In southern Portugal it is of vital
    significance to farmers that owe their livelihood to olive oil trading and to
    entire rural communities tied up to jobs in olive orchard management as well on
    the being off of their farming community. As seen, in order to apply a successful
    irrigation programme to olive trees it is of critical importance to have knowledge
    of their physiological responses and sensitivity to different irrigation strategies
    at different stages of their growth cycle. It is the aim of the present work to
    study those relationships and quantify yield and olive oil characteristics of
    low-density olive trees of cv. Cordovil grown in orchards in southern Portugal
    under full, sustained and regulated deficit irrigation management. The effect
    of soil and crop water status on olive tree physiological responses obtained via
    the plant water stress indicators stomatal conductance and predawn and midday
    leaf potential is evaluated at different stages of their growth cycle, to quantify
    leaf and plant water status and determine their sensitivity to different irrigation
    strategies. Concurrently, soil water status is evaluated through soil moisture
    profile probe sensors to account for the applied water and its accessibility by
    olive trees rooting system. Subjected to different irrigation schedules and amounts
    that might impact on oil quality, such is quantified by chemical and sensory analyses
    from extracted oils obtained from carefully harvested representative sub-treatments
    selected from each irrigation treatment. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experiment
    location and design This study was carried out in at the Herdade dos Lameirões
    near Safara, in the region of Moura, province of Alentejo, Portugal (lat. 38°05′15″N;
    long. 07°16′39″W; alt. 75 m) using a representative orchard stand of mature olive
    trees (Olea europaea L. cv. Cordovil). The over 80-year-old mature olive orchard
    was planted on a 12 by 12 m spacing layout and was converted in 2005 from dry-farming
    to drip irrigation. The trees were treated in 2006 and 2007 from mid March to
    the end of October in 2006 and from mid March to the end of November in 2007 using
    one of four irrigation treatments: a treatment A with full-rate irrigation of
    77 trees to the full soil water holding capacity and continuously replenished,
    a SDI treatment B with irrigation of 64 trees to provide for approximately 60%
    of the water applied in treatment A, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or treatment
    C in which water is applied to the 60 trees only during the three critical phase
    periods: before flowering, at beginning of pit hardening and before crop harvesting,
    to provide enough water to replenish the soil moisture to field capacity, and
    a dry-farming treatment D. Phenological stages of the olive trees was recorded
    throughout the irrigation cycle following the widely accepted BBCH decimal code
    and procedure described in Sanz-Cortés et al. (2002), a phenological descriptor
    of olive trees whereby the entire developmental cycle of the crop is subdivided
    into ten clearly recognizable and distinguishable longer lasting phases of principal
    and secondary growth stages. In the process, the pit hardening phase was identified
    and used to establish the onset of irrigation for treatment C, in July 3, 2006
    and July 11, 2007, respectively. Reference evapotranspiration, ET0 was calculated
    using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method and the procedures prescribed by Allen et
    al. (1998). Each tree was water supplied by a single drip line with emitters spaced
    1 m apart throughout the entire length of the emitter line placed at the soil
    surface and laid out along each tree row and serviced by twelve 3.6 l h−1 emitters.
    Weather data and rainfall events were collected by an automatic meteorological
    station placed within a few hundred meters from the olive orchard. Hourly averages
    of the meteorological parameters, wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation,
    precipitation and relative humidity were recorded and evaluated. Half-hour averages
    of the net radiation above the canopy of the trees were measured using one NrLite
    net radiometer (Kipp & Konen, Holland) connected to a data logger (Campbell CR10X,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The in situ soil classification indicates
    a clay soil (Vcx) until 0.40 m and silt loam transition to 0.45 m, underneath
    which a restrictive layer of very compact limestone and gravel elements limited
    root development and placement of soil moisture probes. Soil volumetric water
    content at field capacity (−0.03 MPa) was estimated as 0.36 m3 m−3 to 0.18 m,
    and 0.34 m3 m−3 between 0.18 and 0.50 m, whereas wilting point (−1.5 MPa) soil
    volumetric water content was 0.27 and 0.24 m3 m−3, respectively. 2.2. Soil water
    evaluation Two representative trees per treatment were instrumented with access
    tubes for profile probe PR1 sensors (Delta T Devices, Lta., Cambridge, UK) at
    distances of 1, 2, 3 and 6 m along the tree rows and at depths of 0.10; 0.20;
    0.30 and 0.45 m, below which the restrictive layer of limestone and gravel limited
    placement of access tubes and probes. One access tube was also installed between
    rows. Soil water content was monitored and recorded throughout 2006 and 2007 irrigation
    season, with results used to estimate the equivalent depth of water in the soil
    to 0.45 m, and its relative extractable water (REW) defined by Granier (1987)
    as: (1) where R (mm) is the actual soil water content in the root zone; Rmin (mm)
    the minimum soil water content observed during the experiment and Rmax (mm), the
    soil water content at field capacity. To complement the profile probe sensors
    readings and also guide the onset of irrigation, Watermark sensors (Irrometer
    Co. Inc., Riverside, USA) were placed inside the wet bulbs developed by the drip
    emitters at 1 and 3 m from the trunk and along the tree row, at 0.25; 0.45 and
    0.65 m depths. Data were recorded via data logger and averaged on hourly intervals.
    When scheduled for each treatment, according to the full, RDI and SDI options
    and limits of water application, irrigation was applied to trees until reading
    on the Watermark sensor placed at 0.45 m depth approached the water potential
    of −0.06 to −0.07 MPa, a management decision that provided for the least number
    of weekly irrigation and helped to reduce losses via soil evaporation. Table 1
    presents the amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment during 2006
    and 2007. Data collected from an automatic meteorological station near the olive
    orchard provided for the inputs used on the calculation of Penman-Monteith potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0). Table 1. Fruit and oil yield (mean and standard deviation),

    10 to January 18); the value in-between parenthesis represents the total water
    applied by irrigation. 2.3. Plant water stress indicators During 2006 and 2007
    stomata conductance measurements were carried out in fully expanded leaves of
    the year of three trees per treatment, at sunrise and 13:30 GTM, well illuminated
    and at chest height. A diffusion of continuous flow LI-1600 porometer (LI-1600
    Inc., IT USES) similar to the one described in Parkinson (1985) was used. Predawn
    (ψb) and midday leaf potential (ψmin) were also evaluated to determine leaf and
    plant water status, according to the methodology described in Goldhamer and Salinas
    Fereres (2001). A pressure chamber type PMS (PMS Inst., Corvallis, OR, USES) was
    used and healthy leaves of the year in the shade and at chest height were monitored,
    after covering them with a wet cloth during the short period of time in-between
    incision and their placement in the pressure chamber. The ψb describes the plant
    water status when a balance between soil and tree water potential is deemed achieved
    Bergonci et al. (2000), while ψmin provides critical tree water potential values
    when transpiration rates are at peak. 2.4. Sap flow measurement The Compensation
    Heat-Pulse method (CHP) developed by Swanson and Whitfield (1981) and modified
    by Green et al. (2003) was used to evaluate tree sap flow and tree transpiration
    rates. As described in Fernández et al., 1996, Fernández et al., 1997 a representative
    tree in each treatment was selected and outfitted with three set of heat-pulse
    velocity (HPV) probes and specific software was used for analysis of results.
    More detail on procedure is found in Santos et al. (2007). 2.5. Orchard yield,
    oil extraction and analyses At harvest, olives from three representative sub-treatments
    in each irrigation treatment were hand picked and weighed. Concurrently, a sample
    of olives of about 3 kg per harvested sub-treatment were selected and transported
    to the laboratory for oil extraction. An Abencor analyzer (MC2, Ingenierias y
    System, Seville, Spain) system that reproduces industrial oil extraction (Grattan
    et al., 2006) was used for extraction of olive oil from the olive samples following
    the procedure and extraction phases described in Berenguer et al. (2006). The
    extracted oil was afterwards transferred to bottles of dark glass and stored at
    4° C temperature while waiting for the chemical and sensory analyses. Oil samples
    were analyzed for acidity (% of oleic acid), peroxide value (meq O2 per kg of
    oil), UV absorbance (K232 and K270) and sensory attributes of organoleptic evaluation,
    according to European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 and European Union Regulation
    EC 1893/03 regulations. The ripeness index (RI) was evaluated following procedures
    described in Hermoso et al. (1999) by setting the maturity index scale from 0
    (olives with intense green color) to 7 (olives with black skin and flesh purple
    to the pit). The percent of moisture in the resulting olive paste obtained from
    the Abencor extraction was estimated as moisture difference between wet and dry
    paste. The percent of oil content in the dry paste was evaluated by Nuclear Magnetic
    Resonance (NMS 110 minispect analyzer, Bruker) while the oil acidity, an indicator
    of free fatty acid levels in the oil, was expressed as percent of oleic acid (European
    Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 annex II). Free fat acid auto-oxidation plays an
    important role in the flavor characteristics and formation of organoleptic toxic
    compounds that reduce the nutritional value of the olive oil and its market value.
    Peroxide values were evaluated, as they indicate the state of initial oxidation
    of given oil and they are defined as the quantity of active oxygen (meq) in 1
    kg of fat or oil (European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 annex III). Secondary
    products resulting of oil oxidation where evaluated as UV absorbance, K232 and
    K270, indices that indicate the state of oil conservation and secondary alterations
    induced by technological processes (European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91, annex
    IX). Sensorial evaluation of the oil flavor was done by following the organoleptic
    method of classifying oil in a numerical scale of perception of the intensity
    of flavor stimulus in the mouth. It follows the present European Union Regulation
    EEC 2568/91 annex XII procedures where the intensity of the attribute is measured
    in a scale of 6, being 0 an imperceptible perception and 5, an extreme one. No
    negative attributes were observed. An overall grading procedure in a nine-point
    scale ranging from 1, the lowest quality, to 9, the exceptional quality, was lastly
    applied to attribute a single classification score to each oil simple analyzed.
    This final average score results from blending the quality attributes and weaknesses
    of the analyzed oil, allowing it to be classified as extra virgin when the overall
    grading is equal to or higher than 6.5, as virgin if graded 5.5–6.5, or lampant,
    if classified between 3.5 and 5.5. 2.6. Statistical analysis The software SPSS
    version 15 was used for statistical data analysis. When a significant effect of
    factors in the study or the interaction between them is supported by the analysis
    of variance, the Tukey test with a level of signification α = 0.05 was used for
    identification of differences between mean values. The experimental effect of
    the two trial years was separately analyzed. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Climatic
    characterization For the period in study the average total rainfall was 521.8
    and 333.7 mm in 2006 and 2007 respectively, with the wet season spanning from
    October to April and a long and dry summer season lasting from May to September.
    Worthwhile noticing the impact of 2007 low rainfall on yield and produced oil.
    The dry season is the period for irrigation when trees need water to balance the
    high evapotranspiration rates resulting from the long and dry days, of intense
    net radiation (Fig. 1a and b), high vapour pressure deficit and low soil moisture
    content. Daily atmospheric water demand is high during the period, with potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0) rates reaching values as high as 8 mm day−1 in the months
    of July and August (Fig. 1a and b), and the stored winter rainfall in the soil
    is unavailable for remobilization, being long used during the dry spells of early
    Spring (Santos et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Potential

    Seasonal evolution of relative extractable water (REW) in the soil during 2006
    and 2007 irrigation periods is presented in Fig. 2. With REW values for treatment
    A between 0.89 and 0.98 throughout the 2006 irrigation season (Fig. 2a) indicating
    well-watered trees, predawn leaf water potential readings, ψb were kept high,
    of less or equal −1 MPa (Fig. 3a), a threshold value for plant water stress according
    to Muñoz-Cobo (2005). Concerning treatment B, REW were at all times in-between
    0.74 and 0.92, slightly lower than the values recorded for treatment A, as only
    60% of tree evapotranspiration (ETc) was been replaced by irrigation. Predawn
    leaf water potential readings reflected such fact with values slightly below −1
    MPa. The regulated deficit irrigation regime imposed to treatment C, with water
    applied at periods more sensitive to water deficit (before flowering, at pit hardening
    and about 15 days before harvest), justifies the erratic behaviour of REW presented
    in Fig. 2a. Until the day of year (DOY) 172, a period without irrigation, REW
    gradually decreased to values close to 0.37. Following irrigation in DOY 194,
    REW climbed to a maximum of 0.97, when soil water content was 0.34 m3 m−3 but
    after DOY 194 they gradually declined to their lowest value in DOY 262, when volumetric
    soil water content was of 0.11 m3 m−3. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    C; , treatment D. During the 2007 irrigation season, treatment A presented values
    of REW in-between 0.87 and 1.0, except around DOY 235 when they dipped lower due
    to a week failure in the irrigation system. Fig. 2b presents such results. With
    40% less water applied to treatment B, the REW values stayed in-between 0.85 and
    1.0 and close to the ones observed for treatment A, indicating that soil water
    stayed near field capacity. Predawn leaf water potential, ψb were slightly lower
    than −1 MPa (Fig. 3b), also indicating that well irrigated trees. For treatment
    C and during half of the period in evaluation, volumetric soil water content stayed
    low, of around 0.18 m3 m−3 with REW values alternating in-between 0.17 and 0.27.
    The former was recorded in mid August (DOY 235) when most of the soil moisture
    had been depleted. After irrigation, in DOY 201, REW recovered to 0.95, as did
    happen in 2006 (Fig. 3b). In the eight days of measurements, treatment D volumetric
    soil water content was below wilting point and REW values stayed in-between 0.04
    and 0.43. However, when the soil moisture was replenished with 20.8 mm of rainfall,
    REW values quickly bounced back, between DOY 247 and 271 (Fig. 2b). In general,
    REW values remained always below 0.4 in this treatment and ψb (Fig. 3b) also reflected
    such fact with low values of ψb recorded during the period. Higher moisture in
    the soil throughout the summer irrigation cycle and consequent high leaf water
    potential confirm the importance of irrigating olive trees in Alentejo, a Mediterranean
    region denied of meaningful summer rainfall and where olive trees are conditioned
    to thrive in shallow soils of restrictive layer that limit deep soil water storage
    and remobilization by roots. 3.3. Midday stomatal leaf conductance and midday
    leaf water potential During the irrigation season of 2006 the evolution of midday
    leaf water potential (Ψmin) readings (Fig. 4a) was distinct for trees receiving
    the full irrigation (treatment A) and trees submitted to partial water stress
    (treatments B and C). The larger differential was observed at beginning of September,
    on DOY 233, of around −0.60 and −1.05 MPa respectively, reflecting the effect
    of the lower soil water content of treatments B and C, respectively on leaf water
    status. Treatment A, as expected, was the one presenting the highest Ψmin readings
    throughout the season. The deficit irrigation treatments B and C recorded Ψmin
    values that remained very close to −2 MPa in the first three periods of measurements
    (DOY 137, 172 and 194) and not far from the readings of treatment A. However into
    the summer, they decreased in the fourth day of measurements (DOY 233) when readings
    were the lowest, of −2.85 and −3.3 MPa respectively for treatments B and C. On
    the third day of measurements, DOY 194, even though trees of treatment C were
    being supplied with irrigation water and the volumetric soil water was very close
    to field capacity, of about 0.34 m3 m−3, the recovery of Ψmin was not complete
    and stayed slightly below the readings of treatment B. Download : Download full-size

    chamber in different days of 2006 (a) and 2007 (b). ♢, treatment A; ■, treatment
    B; Δ, treatment C; , treatment D. In 2007 the status of leaf water was at its
    highest level for the different treatments on DOY 149 (Fig. 4b), coincident with
    the period under analysis in which volumetric soil water was at its highest for
    all treatments, except for treatment C. From DOY 149 onward they slowly declined
    for all treatments, as seen in Fig. 4b, due to non favorable summer net radiation
    which up to the fifth day of measurement, at DOY 219, presented high values of
    around 600 W m−2 (Fig. 6), to decline to values close to 500 W m−2 afterward.
    Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was also high in the period, resulting that both
    variables were important factors influencing the transfer of water into the atmosphere
    and promoting the decline in Ψmin readings. Overall, trees of fully irrigated
    treatment A presented the highest values of Ψmin, closely followed by treatment
    B values. Here, Ψmin values were at their lowest level on DOY 235, of −2.85 MPa.
    As for treatment C, in five of the eight days of measurement Ψmin readings were
    lower than treatment B. Likewise in 2006, on DOY 219 and due to irrigation Ψmin
    readings of treatment C showed slight recovery, but never a complete one, since
    Ψmin remained quite apart from treatments A and B readings. It is conspicuous
    from Fig. 4 that for treatment C as the moisture content declined so did Ψmin,
    with lower and lower values, up to −3.05 MPa in the end of the summer, on DOY
    271. The evolution of Ψmin in 2006 and 2007 showing distinct differences among
    irrigation regimes confirm that the SDI regime of continuous water stress imposed
    by treatment B as more beneficial to trees than the regulated deficit regime of
    treatment C. In the latter, the irrigation scheduling applied to trees deprived
    them of needed water in crucial periods of the growing cycle, depicted by the
    progressive decline in their leaf potential values. Furthermore, with the imposed
    stress their recovery was slow and never fully achieved. For treatment D, Ψmin
    readings quickly decreased from early mid June (−2 MPa) until DOY 235 when Ψmin
    was the lowest, of around −3.2 MPa. Between DOY 235 and DOY 247 there was a slight
    recovery of Ψmin readings with the replenishment of moisture to the soil resulting
    from the 17.5 mm rainfall (data not shown). Midday stomatal leaf conductance (gs)
    was also influenced by the different irrigation regimes (Fig. 5). In 2006 (Fig.
    5a), trees of treatment A presented the lowest levels of gs in the spring, on
    DOY 137, of about 0.079 mol m−2 s−1. In this particular day, the volumetric soil
    water was however high, of 0.35 m3 m−3. The day was cloudy and net radiation at
    solar midday was of 431.2 W m−2 (Fig. 6). On DOY 194, gs again decreased noticeably,
    to 0.085 mol m−2 s−1. With high water content in the soil, the decline in gs suggests
    stomata closure due to the relatively VPD, of around 5.53 kPa (Fig. 6). Connor
    (2005) mentioned decreasing stomatal conductance rates and low leaf water potential
    values reflecting leaf responses to adverse climatic variables and a mechanism
    to maintain transpiration efficiency. In the two last days of measurements (DOY
    233 and DOY 262), gs values increased to value as high as 0.176 mol m−2 s−1. In
    general, trees of treatment B showed a gs trend very similar to the one observed
    for treatment A but with slightly lower values. Concerning treatment C, on the
    first three days in which measurements were carried out (DOY 137 172 and 194),
    gs stayed close to 0.10 mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 194, when trees were being irrigated
    gs values were still low, of about 0.101 mol m2 s−1, consequence of the previous
    days of water stress, and despite the already high soil water content, close to
    field capacity. Trees of treatment C presented on DOY 233 the lowest gs values,
    of around 0.073 mol m−2 s−1 when soil water content was low (0.155 m3 m−3), suggesting
    stomata closure due to the low soil moisture. By the end of the summer, DOY 262,
    the value of gs had increased only slightly. Download : Download full-size image

    (Fig. 5b) shows that leaves of treatment A recorded the largest gs value, 0.251
    mol m−2 s−1, in the spring, on DOY 149. Between DOY 163 and DOY 219, gs values
    had declined to 0.17 mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 235 soil water content had decreased
    quite considerably and through the defensive mechanism stomata closure, gs readings
    of 0.094 mol m−2 s−1 were observed. From that day onward, there was a slight recovery
    in gs values, matching those of treatment B. In spite of the high water content
    in the soil, treatment A had only a partial departure from the observed low gs
    values in the last two days of measurement, when VPD and net radiation declined
    considerably by the end of summer. For treatment B, the highest gs reading was
    observed on DOY 219, of about 0.180 mol m−2 s−1, and the lowest on DOY 235, as
    did observed in the same day for treatment A. Early into spring, on DOY 149, treatment
    C gs readings did present values close to those of treatment D, of about 0.157
    mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 201 the recorded values were close to those of treatment B,
    of 0.114 mol m−2 s−1 due to the added irrigation water, and on DOY 219 they were
    again very low and close to 0.080 mol m−2 s−1. They remained low until the end
    of the summer. The evolution of Ψmin and gs in 2006 and 2007 showing distinct
    differences among irrigation regimes confirm that the SDI regime of a constant
    deficit imposed to treatment B as more beneficial to trees than the regulated
    deficit regime of treatment C. In the latter, the applied irrigation scheduling
    and lack of late summer rainfall in 2007 deprived trees of needed water in crucial
    periods of the growing cycle, depicted by the progressive decline of leaf water
    potential and stomatal closure. Furthermore, with the imposed stress their recovery
    was slow and never fully achieved. Such fact agrees with Fernández et al. (1996)
    observation of delays in olive trees recovery after a period of severe water stress,
    probably due to xylem vessels cavitation. Moriana et al. (2003) also point out
    such delay in leaf water status recovery in olive trees. For treatment D, Ψmin
    readings quickly decreased from early in the spring gs values of treatment D were
    high in the first two days of measurements (0.155 mol m−2 s−1) but declined quickly
    throughout summer (0.062 mol m−2 s−1) due to stomatal closure related to the ever
    decreasing level of moisture in the soil. Both in 2006 and in 2007, Ψmin and gs
    values of dry-farming treatment D were very low throughout summer, confirming
    that soil water profile was deprived of stored water for remobilization by the
    root system to fully complement trees water requirements. The results also corroborate
    the need to irrigate the traditional low-density olive trees in Alentejo, to alleviate
    summer water stress and help boost final yield. 3.4. Olive oil yield and characteristics
    Table 1 indicates that olive yield varied considerably in the two years under
    study due to the effect of the biennial variation of fruit production that is
    a typical characteristic of this species. In 2006 “on year” of high yield, there
    were no significant differences in fruit yield between the irrigated treatments.
    Production varied between 4800.9 and 3741.3 kg ha−1, with the higher and lower
    production rates assigned to between B and A respectively. Treatment C was the
    second most productive, showing a reduction in yield of 769.8 kg ha−1 when compared
    to treatment B. Fruit yield of treatment A, that had received the most water,
    was 1059.6 kg ha−1 less than treatment B. Even in the rain-fed conditions of treatment
    D yield were high, of 2875.0 kg ha−1. In 2007 “off year” of poor harvest, there
    was no significant difference in fruit yield between irrigated and non-irrigated
    treatments. In general, yield suffered a severe decline when compared to 2006,
    of 86.5% and 83.7% for treatments A and B, respectively. Concerning treatments
    C and D, the decline was even more pronounced, of 95.9% and 96.2%, respectively.
    This fact suggests that trees under irrigation regimes that are particularly stressful
    to them, such as in the case of treatments C and D, suffer more drastic yield
    reductions in “off years”. Deficit irrigation programmes such as the “regulated
    deficit irrigation” end up suffering more from a net accumulation of leaves and
    fewer flowers which tend to limit production in the subsequent year (Alegre et
    al., 2002). A similar widespread loss of production such as occurred in 2007 had
    been reported by Serrano (1998). They state that olive trees in “off years” are
    prone to yield drop as low as 90% of obtained in “on years”. Sibbett (2002) discussed
    a range of possible factors that can lead to such phenomena including, among others,
    the level of irrigation and time of harvest. It is worth mentioning that nationally
    year 2007 was allegedly a “off year”, with recorded average drop in olive tree
    yield of around 50% Anonymous (2007), jointly attributed to high temperatures
    that occurred in the ten first days of May, during flowering, immediately followed
    by days of very low and below average temperatures. In 2006 the impact of irrigation
    treatments on olive oil yield per hectare was more evident than on fruit yield
    per hectare. Treatments B and D had the highest and lowest olive oil yield, of
    966.3 and 564 kg ha−1, respectively, in harmony with the results of Muñoz-Cobo
    (2005). Treatments A and C produced slightly higher olive oil yield per hectare
    than treatment D (Table 1). Even though there were no statistical differences
    in yield per hectare among irrigation treatments in 2006, treatment B yield was
    considerably higher than the other treatments. In 2007 it was once again the treatments
    B and D that produced the highest and lowest olive oil yield, again with no significant
    statistical differences among treatments. However, despite of the 2007 evident
    decrease in olive oil production compared to 2006, it is worth noticing that treatment
    B produced the highest olive oil yield per ha on both years while treatment D
    had the lowest yield. The 2006 reduction in fruit quantity between treatments
    B and A was of around 22.0% and, in-between treatments B and C it was around 16.0%,
    causing a reduction of olive oil for the same treatments of 32.5% and 23.9%, respectively.
    Similarly, in 2007 the drop in fruit and olive oil production between treatments
    B and A was of 35.6% and 40.1% respectively, and in-between treatments B and C
    of 78.9% and 78.8%. These results contrast with those obtained by Lavee et al.
    (2007) that in a test carried out in Israel reported average yield drop over a
    period of four consecutive years higher for fruit than for olive oil. Treatment
    B emerges as the one carrying the highest fruit and olive oil yield during the
    two years of trial. Using less 431.3 mm of water in 2006 than treatment A, it
    produced 313.7 kg per ha more olive oil and in 2007, despite the widespread drop
    in yield, it produced again more 79.4 kg of olive oil per ha than treatment A,
    using less 363.3 mm of irrigation water. The percentage of fruit moisture during
    the extraction of the olive oil was higher in treatments receiving the highest
    rates of irrigation water (Table 4). Treatments A and D recorded the highest and
    lowest percentage of pulp moisture on both years under study. Compared to 2006,
    olive fruits from the different irrigation treatments presented a lower percent
    of moisture in 2007, probably due to the smaller amounts of water applied that
    year (Table 1). The difference in fruit moisture levels from treatments A and
    D was 8.8% and 16.5% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Concerning oil acidity, in
    2006 treatment A that received the largest amount of water was the one that had
    the highest level of acidity (Table 2) of 0.77%, very close to the threshold value
    defined by European Regulation EC 1989/03 for extra virgin olive oil (<0.8%).
    All other treatments had lower acidity levels and the olive oil from treatment
    D had the lowest level, with 0.53% of acidity. There were no significant differences
    between treatments C and D, the ones with the lowest levels of acidity and also
    which received the lowest levels of irrigation water. In 2007 the behaviour was
    statistically identical to the 2006 results, with treatment A showing 0.73% of
    acidity, slightly higher than the other treatments. It is worth noticing that
    all treatments, with the exception of treatment A, showed a lower percentage of
    acidity in 2007, suggesting that the lower amount of water applied across all
    treatments (except A), could have been the reason for such a drop. The effects
    of irrigation on the acidity levels in olive oil are consistent with the results
    obtained by Berenguer et al. (2006). They found in a study carried out on cv.
    Arbequina over a 2 years period that olive oil from well-watered trees always
    had a higher percentage of acidity in the following year, despite reductions in
    water applications. Similarly, Muñoz-Cobo (2005) obtained higher levels of acidity
    in olive oil of well-watered olive trees. However, a different point of view is
    presented by Dettori et al. (1989) and Tovar et al. (2002) who conclude that olive
    oil acidity is not influenced by the amount of irrigation. Over the two-year study
    period olive oil from all irrigation treatments presented peroxide values which
    were below the official limit set by law, of 20 meq O2 kg−1. In 2006, peroxide
    count was higher in treatment D followed by treatments A and C. The lowest level
    was obtained for treatment B, as seen in Table 2. In 2007 the peroxide count of
    treatment B was still low, and the highest values were obtained for treatments
    C and D. In general, over the two-year period the highest peroxide counts were
    recorded for olive oils of irrigation treatments C and D subjected to more water
    restrictions. In contrast, Salas et al. (1997) and Tovar et al. (2002) observed
    highest concentration of peroxides in well irrigated treatments, while Berenguer
    et al. (2006) obtained inconclusive results. Patumi et al. (1999) and Gómez-Rico
    et al. (2009) reported no relationship between irrigation water levels and peroxide
    counts. Table 2. Quality index of cv. Cordovil olive oil obtained with the four

    the same letter in the same column are not significantly different by Tukey test
    at P ≤ 0.05. Table 2 presents the UV absorbance values at 270 nm (K270) obtained
    in 2006 and 2007. The highest values in 2006 were obtained in olive oils of treatments
    C and D that received the least amount of water and the lowest levels from well-watered
    trees (treatments A and B). In 2007 the highest values were obtained in olive
    oils from treatment C and no significant differences were observed between the
    others treatments. This observation is in agreement with the observation in Berenguer
    et al. (2006) that in years when all treatments receive less water, as in 2007,
    the statistics differences in the values of K270 between treatments are less marked.
    Tovar et al. (2002) and Gómez-Rico et al. (2009) found also no significant differences
    between irrigation treatments in respect to K270 absorbance levels. Concerning
    the UV absorbance at 232 nm (K232), they were lower in the rain-fed treatment
    D, but presented no significant difference between the irrigated treatments (Table
    2). These results contradict those of Muñoz-Cobo (2005), who obtained the highest
    K232 in olive oils produced in dry conditions. Both K232 and K270 absorbance levels
    for all treatments were however lower than the limits defined by legislation (≤0.22–2.50
    for K270 and K232). In terms of olive oil quality parameters, on both years (2006
    and 2007) they were for all treatments within the limits established in the European
    Regulation EC 1989/03, allowing them to be classified as oils of high quality.
    Treatment B, which we had elected as the most favorable irrigation scheme to maximize
    olive yield, also produced the highest quality of olive oil. Generally known as
    having a slightly bitter and sharp flavor, the olive oils from cv. Cordovil obtained
    in our trial treatments in 2006 and 2007 (Table 3) were slightly bitter (0.5)
    or had no bitterness (0.0), mild, as preferred by Portuguese consumers. As for
    sharpness, they were slightly sharp (1) for the two years of the study. Oils from
    treatments C and D had a fruity flavor of 3, slightly better than treatments A
    and B that scored in level 2. However, the quality and flavor of the olive oils
    were greatly influenced by the ripeness index (RI), an indicator to be taken into
    account when producing oils of specific sensory and chemical characteristics.

    in 2007 on two different dates (Table 4). The first samples tested in November
    for RI showed no significant differences between treatments C and D. It showed
    that treatment A was maturing at a slower rate than the others and had a significantly
    lower level of RI, of 2.73. With the second sample taken a month latter, in December,
    olive from treatment D had the highest RI of 4.85 and no significant differences
    were observed between the irrigated treatments that had RI values of around 4.
    However, treatments A and B had the lowest rates of ripeness, probably due to
    the type of irrigation they were receiving. Worth pointing out that in-between
    the first and second sampling for ripeness, a rainfall of approximately 30.6 mm
    might have caused fruits of treatments C and D also to ripen at a slower rate
    (Grattan et al., 2006, Motilva et al., 2000). Table 4. Influence of irrigation

    ± 0.809a a Treatments with the same letter in the same column are not significantly
    different by Tukey test at P ≤ 0.05. On a general assessment of the olive oils
    produced in 2006, treatment C oils scored with the highest organoleptic value
    of 8 (Table 3) on a scale of 1–9. However, all oils scored 7.5 points and above.
    In 2007, a year of less water applied to trees, the olive oils from treatments
    B, C and D had the highest organoleptic values of 7.5 and treatment A that received
    the most water, scored only 7. In general, all samples scored above 6.5 which
    according to European Regulation EC 1989/03 classify them as olive oils of superior
    quality and therefore “extra virgin”. 3.5. Water productivity Ranking the irrigated
    treatments in terms of oil yield per unit water, treatment C, despite the concentration
    of irrigation only in critical phases of growing cycle, had high water use efficiency
    in 2006, of 11.8 kg of oil per mm of applied water (Table 1). Treatment B was
    the second most productive, with 2.2 kg of oil per mm of water applied. The least
    productive treatment was treatment A which shows a clear decline in yield with
    the amount of water applied. In 2007, an “off year” of drastic reduction in yield,
    treatment B was the most productive with 0.42 kg of oil per mm of water applied,
    followed by treatment C. Treatment A trailed behind with 0.12 kg of oil per mm
    of applied water. It seems that in years of sharp reduction of water availability
    for irrigation, as in 2007, treatment B is the best option for scheduling irrigation
    of olive trees of cv. Cordovil in southern Portugal. Table 5 shows that during
    the period in which sap sensors were installed, the fraction of water applied
    to the soil both in terms of irrigation and rainfall that contributed to the production
    of biomass was different among the irrigation treatments. Trees of treatment A
    made the least use of applied water and had water productivity between 62.8% and
    91.4% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2006 about 37.2% of the water applied
    had been lost through evaporation or drainage and, in 2007 it was of 8.6% as the
    water applied had been reduced by 37.9% compared to 2006. Contrastingly, in 2007
    trees of treatment B in addition of the water supplied by rainfall and irrigation,
    during the period of installation of sap flow sensors they also were able to harvest
    stored water from previous rainfall to provide for tree transpiration. Table 5.

    333.7 mm in 2007. 4. Conclusion Results show that trees responded differently
    to summer rainfall and irrigation water. The sustained, SDI and regulated deficit
    irrigation, RDI scheduling regimes applied to treatments B and C respectively
    led to reduced applications of irrigation water and higher yield. However, over
    the two-year period the sustained deficit irrigation regime proved to be the most
    favorable irrigation strategy for use in the “on” and “off” years of olive oil
    production, leading to appreciable water resource savings and yields. Full irrigation
    of olive trees as assigned to treatment A led to waste of irrigation water, as
    olive trees from beginning of pit hardening until mid September slow down their
    vegetative growth and use less water despite of the amount applied. Results also
    support the hypothesis that irrigation of low-density olive orchards is needed
    as it increases yields and the amount of olive extracted oil. They also confirm
    that irrigation treatments has no influence on the commercial value of produced
    oils, being all of superior quality and classified as “extra virgin”. Being the
    cultivar Cordovil highly appreciated for its high fruit free fatty acid and the
    fine sensory properties of its extracted oil, responsible for the seal of quality
    “Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)” conferred to the region, such findings
    are of vital importance to farmers for they allow them freedom to tackle the re-structuring
    and irrigation of their traditional low-density orchards confident of higher yields
    and fearless of losing quality and the PDO entitlement. Acknowledgements This

    system offers a viable treatment modality for managing outcomes in patients with
    LCPLs. Strengths and limitations of this study This is the first study to explore
    the outcomes of apical negative pressure irrigation in nonsurgical root canal
    therapy for large cyst-like periapical lesions. A modified apical negative pressure
    irrigation system is designed to overcome limitations such as high costs, complex
    operation, the risk of injury due to improper usage, and limited availability
    in certain dental practices. The imaging examinations in this study were consistently
    scheduled for the 6-month follow-up period, which is more significant than what
    has been observed in other studies with inconsistent follow-up times. The limitations
    of this study include its retrospective case series design and the limited number
    of included patients. Peer Review reports Introduction Large cyst-like periapical
    lesions (LCPLs) originate from the epithelial remnants of Malassez located within
    the periodontal ligament [1]. These lesions manifest as pathological cavities
    fully lined with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium of varying thickness,
    forming a three-dimensional structure within apical periodontitis [1]. It is important
    to emphasize that LCPLs should be regarded as indicators of cyst formation due
    to apical periodontitis [2, 3]. The prevalence of LCPLs varies between 6% and
    55% [4,5,6]. These defects more frequently manifest in the maxilla than in the
    mandible, with the maxillary lateral and central incisors being the most commonly
    affected teeth. While benign in nature, LCPLs induce inflammation and bone destruction,
    necessitating prompt treatment. The treatment approach for LCPLs depends on the
    severity of the disease and the patient’s medical history. Nonsurgical treatment
    refers to nonsurgical root canal therapy, while surgical alternatives include
    endodontic surgery and tooth extraction. NSRCT represents a highly predictable
    and reliable treatment for LCPLs with a commendable success rate ranging from
    approximately 82.2–83.3% [3, 6]. Research has indicated that the survival rates
    of patients after NSRCT and apical surgery are not significantly different following
    the failure of primary root canal therapy [2]. Moreover, researchers have unveiled
    the utility of NSRCT in managing LCPLs [7, 8]. Histological investigations have
    demonstrated the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in promoting
    cellular chemotaxis and plasma protein extravasation, culminating in fluid accumulation
    within LCPLs [9]. This, in turn, results in increased hydrostatic pressure, thereby
    contributing to lesion expansion. The accumulation of metabolic byproducts establishes
    a notable osmotic gradient, driving fluid flow into the cystic cavity and fostering
    lesion wall expansion [9, 10]. NSRCT mitigates hydrostatic pressure through aspiration
    and decompression, potentially expediting the healing process of LCPLs [11]. Syringe
    irrigation is commonly employed for root canal irrigation. However, multiple studies
    have demonstrated that positive pressure irrigants delivered via syringes and
    needles cannot adequately address root canal irregularities, lateral canals, or
    the isthmi [12, 13]. Furthermore, irrigant and debris may be extruded from the
    apical foramen, potentially damaging apical tissue. The concept of apical negative
    pressure irrigation (ANPI) was first introduced by Fukumoto et al. [14]. ANPI
    entails applying negative pressure to the root canal, creating a vacuum effect
    that facilitates the removal of bacterial and dentinal debris. This is achieved
    by inserting a needle into the root apex and using an instrument to apply negative
    pressure and effective decompression while introducing an irrigant solution to
    flush out bacterial and dentinal debris. The vacuum effect ensures thorough cleaning
    and disinfection of the root canal, thus yielding predictable treatment outcomes
    [15]. Other studies have shown that ANPI prevents apical extrusion of irrigants
    and is particularly effective for narrow isthmi roots [16,17,18]. Fluid dynamics
    research has shown that ANPI microcapsules can create fluid flow in the apical
    region and establish negative apical pressure values for effective decompression
    of LCPL [13]. This finding suggested that ANPI may enhance the decompression effect
    inside LCPLs during the NSRCT process. Researchers believe that successful resolution
    of a large periapical lesion can be achieved through accurate diagnosis and the
    implementation of an appropriate treatment strategy, thereby eliminating the need
    for surgical intervention. ANPI may offer advantages for intra-LCPL decompression
    of exudates [19]. Despite these advantages, the effectiveness of the ANPI remains
    a subject of debate. Several popular endodontic irrigation systems, including
    EndoVac, EasyClean, and VATEA, have limitations, such as high costs, complex operation,
    risk of injury due to improper usage, and limited availability in certain dental
    practices [20]. Thus, our aim was to address these issues by developing a modified
    ANPI system using readily available clinical instruments, offering advantages
    such as affordability, ease of use, and broad applicability [21]. While NSRCT
    has been widely employed as the primary treatment for LCPLs, efforts should be
    made to enhance its success rate and expedite the treatment process. To the best
    of our knowledge, no previous study has explored the outcomes of the ANPI in NSRCT
    for LCPLs. Therefore, this case series study was undertaken to assess the efficacy
    of the ANPI in treating LCPLs in NSRCT using a modified ANPI model. Materials
    and methods Patient selection No previous study has explored the outcomes of the
    ANPI in patients with LCPLs in the NSRCT. Therefore, before commencing our study,
    we analyzed the results of normal root canal treatment performed by our odontist
    combined with the ANPI (n = 50). A success rate of 92% was achieved. Considering
    the 10% relative precision and 95% confidence interval, a minimum of 29 teeth
    needed to be included. Considering a 20% attrition rate, a sample of 35 patients
    (35 teeth) with LCPLs was included [3]. All patients underwent NSRCT for LCPLs
    at the Department of General Dentistry, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang
    University School of Medicine, from January 2017 to June 2022. The diagnosis was
    based on preoperative clinical and radiographic criteria outlined in a prior study
    [4, 22]. These criteria included the presence of a non-vital tooth, a radiolucent
    area ≥ 5 mm with a distinct radiopaque border affecting one or more teeth, and
    confirmation that the lesion originated from the tooth. This research was approved
    by the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University
    School of Medicine (No: 2022–0709 (I2022907)). Patients aged 12–60 years with
    complete root development; no systemic diseases (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension,
    diabetes, AIDS); complete preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up CBCT data;
    and a recall period of at least 6 months were included. Additionally, the probing
    depth of the teeth was required to be ≤ 4 mm for optimal periodontal health, and
    the maximum diameter of the periapical lesion, according to the radiographic data,
    was between 5 and 15 mm, with the only drainage pathway being through the root
    canal, keeping the adjacent bony structure intact. Patients with poor long-term
    tooth prognoses, such as root canal imperforation, periodontal disease, cracks
    extending into the deep pulp chamber, or vertical root fractures, were excluded.
    Model construction A modified ANPI system was created based on previous literature
    and ANPI principles [14, 21]. The system included a suction device (Simanfeng,
    Shanghai, China), a specially designed disposable suction tube (Mete Medical,
    Shanghai, China), a specialized metal needle tip (Zhejiang Guangci, Zhejiang,
    China), and a disposable 5 mL syringe (Cofoe, Shanghai, China). The structure
    of the model is depicted in Fig. 1A, and the structure of the suction device is
    shown in Fig. 1B. The specialized metal needle tip was initially employed as the
    microtube for irrigation solution extraction from the apical region, with the
    disposable syringe ensuring a consistent flow rate to the root canal (Fig. 1C).
    The microtube needle tip was available at three diameters (0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, and
    0.7 mm), allowing for selection based on the root canal’s diameter for improved
    adaptability. The suction device, which functions as a negative pressure aspirator,
    is linked to a suction tube, which is further connected to a specialized metal
    needle tip. In the process of negative pressure irrigation, a 5 mL syringe served
    to deliver exogenous irrigation fluid to the upper region of the root canal. Concurrently,
    the metal needle tip was positioned deep within the root apex. The negative pressure
    created by the suction device relies on the metal needle tip, facilitating the
    aspiration of the irrigation fluid into the suction device. This combination of
    components ensures the efficient removal of irrigation fluid from the root apex.

    NSRCT was conducted using the modified ANPI system. Informed consent was obtained
    from patients after discussing the treatment plan and long-term prognosis. A rubber
    dam was used for a dry field, and access to the root canal was established. An
    electronic apex locator (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and a #8
    K-file (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) were used to determine working lengths. Root canal
    preparation was carried out until the canal reached a #15 size, with each K-file
    advanced 2 mm above the apical foramen. The ANPI system was employed for cystic
    fluid drainage. In this phase, a microtube with a diameter of 0.5 or 0.7 mm was
    utilized to facilitate optimal access to the apical area while simultaneously
    preventing canal blockage by debris. Root canal preparation was carried out using
    Ni‒Ti rotary instruments (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) following
    the crown-down preparation method. The canals were irrigated with a combination
    of 1% sodium hypochlorite and 0.9% normal saline using the ANPI system. This entire
    process of instrumenting and enlarging the root canals aimed to ensure that all
    canals reached size F3. Notably, particular attention was given to narrow or curved
    canals, which were prepared up to size F2. The needle tip diameter was chosen
    meticulously to ensure access within 2 mm of the apical foramen. The flow rate
    for each irrigation cycle was 5 mL/min, and the volume of the individual solution
    was 5 ml. Additionally, the suction device maintained a negative pressure value
    of 0.05 MPa. Following the use of different Ni‒Ti rotary instruments, the root
    canal was irrigated with the ANPI system (Fig. 2). During irrigation, the microtube
    needle tip was precisely positioned within 2 mm of the apical foramen. Subsequently,
    the canals were dried using paper points, and a calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] paste
    (Gapadent, Tianjin, China) was applied. One week after the procedure, the root
    canal was irrigated again with the ANPI system. This procedure was repeated 3
    times until the affected tooth no longer showed significant inflammatory exudate
    or pain. Otherwise, the affected tooth can only receive apical surgery. The canals
    were filled with gutta-percha (Gapadent, Tianjin, China) and iRoot SP (Innovative
    BioCeramix, Vancouver, BC, Canada) using the single cone technique. In addition,
    the access cavity was sealed with glass ionomer cement (GC-Fuji IX Japan). A final
    digital periapical radiograph (PA) was obtained to confirm proper obturation.
    Upon completion of the root canal treatment, patients were referred to their general
    dentists for the placement of a permanent coronal restoration. If requested by
    the referring dentist, a permanent restoration was placed before the final restoration.

    fluid to the upper region of the root canal (right) Full size image Patients were
    scheduled for follow-up appointments at intervals of 3 months, 6 months, 1 year,
    2 years, 3 years, and 4 years. Preoperative and 6-month postoperative CBCT scans
    were performed using Planmeca Romexis Viewer 4.5.0R (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland).
    Subsequently, 3D Slicer 5.0.3 software was used to create a 3D radicular lesion
    model from the exported 3D CBCT data. This approach facilitated the calculation
    of the lesion volume. PAs were taken during recall visits, excluding the 6-month
    appointment, to monitor the healing status of large cyst-like periapical lesions.
    Clinical and radiographic evaluation Clinical and radiographic evaluations were
    also conducted by another operator not involved in the previous procedures. The
    clinical evaluation assessed symptoms such as the presence of a sinus tract, sensitivity
    to percussion and palpation, swelling, the presence of periodontal pockets, and
    pain. CBCT images at the 6-month follow-up were assessed blindly twice by a third
    operator with a 2-week interval between the two assessments [23]. The teeth were
    classified according to the following criteria: patients with both healed and
    healing outcomes were considered successful, while non-healed patients were considered
    failures (Table 1). Figure 3A–I shows the cases in each healing category. Table

    reconstruction images obtained at the 6-month recall. The red models represent
    preoperative lesions, while the green models depict postoperative lesions. (A–C)
    Treatment was considered a “failure” because the lesion volume did not decrease.
    (D–F) The lesion was reduced in size at the 6-month recall, so this case was considered
    a ‘‘success”. (G–I) The maximum diameter of this large periapical lesion was 11
    mm. The lesion was undetected at the 6-month recall, so this case was also considered
    a ‘‘success” Full size image The calculation of the lesion’s volume was conducted
    using 3D Slicer 5.0.3 software at the highest possible resolution (0.2 mm for
    both slice thickness and interval), employing semi-automatic active contour segmentation.
    The segmentation process utilized the “fast marching” method, as described by
    Pichon et al. [24], facilitating a semiautomatic approach. This software enables
    straightforward quantification of defect volume in cubic millimeters (mm3). The
    criterion for the absence of a periapical lesion was a radiographic periodontal
    ligament space less than double its width, following the guidelines of Schloss
    et al. [25]. The percentage reduction in the lesion volume was determined using
    the following formula: percentage change in lesion volume (%) = ((preoperative
    volume - postoperative volume)/preoperative volume) × 100. In multirooted teeth,
    when the range of the LCPL encompasses all the roots of the affected tooth simultaneously,
    its assessment and comparison align with those of a single-rooted tooth treated
    with the NSRST. However, if the LCPL does not cover all the roots of the affected
    tooth or if the tooth’s roots receive several LCPLs independently, the evaluation
    and comparison of the tooth’s outcome are determined by the root categorized under
    the ‘worst’ diagnostic outcome [26, 27]. The success of treatment hinges on thorough
    clinical evaluations and radiographic imaging results. At the 6-month follow-up,
    the determination of early treatment success relies on both clinical evaluations
    and lesion volume changes. For follow-up appointments at 1 year or beyond, treatment
    efficacy can be assessed by integrating clinical evaluations with intraoral PA
    imaging. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
    v23.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The intraobserver agreement for the radiographic
    assessments was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient. The data are
    presented as the median (interquartile range [IQR]) because of a nonnormal distribution.
    The data were analyzed using SPSS or GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, California,
    USA). The mean values of the two groups, such as treatment types, were compared
    using the Kruskal‒Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. The mean values
    of three groups, such as types of teeth, were compared using one-way ANOVA followed
    by Tukey’s post hoc test. The chi-square test was used for categorical data analysis.
    A p-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results
    A total of 35 teeth from 35 patients, with a median age of 28 (24–34) years, received
    treatment from our endodontist (Table 2). The median follow-up time was 19 (12–26)
    months. One tooth was extracted due to significant pain at the 6-month follow-up.
    The other two teeth required periapical surgery because of increased volume and
    clinical discomfort. The overall success rate was 91.4%. An intraclass correlation
    coefficient (ICC) of 0.94 demonstrated a strong level of consistency in repeated
    data measurements. Given the high ICC values, the average of the two measurements
    was used for volume assessment. The median preoperative volume was 416.5 (252.5–782)
    mm3. The median postoperative volume was 90 (12–190) mm3. The postoperative volume
    of the LCPL was significantly smaller than the preoperative volume (p < 0.05).
    The median percentage of lesion reduction was 77.0 (54.2–96.4)% at 6 months. Patients
    under 30 years of age had a significantly greater success rate than older patients
    (100.0% vs. 80.0%, p = 0.037). None of the other factors, including sex, jaw,
    lesion size, tooth location, sealer extrusion, or the number of roots, significantly
    influenced the success rate of the treatment (Table 3). The other study parameters
    did not significantly impact the lesion’s volume reduction rate. Table 2 Demographic
    data distribution Full size table Table 3 Distribution of the treatment outcomes
    by study factors and demographics Full size table Discussion The aspiration and
    decompression of LCPLs play crucial roles in reducing osteoclastic activity, preventing
    further damage to the surrounding bone and tissues. Instrumentation beyond the
    apex during NSRCT can alleviate hydrostatic pressure in the LCPL, facilitating
    adequate drainage of cystic fluid and lesion healing [6]. ANPI is a promising
    technique for root canal disinfection and biofilm removal from artificial canals.
    Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in removing the smear layer,
    flushing out debris and irrigant from the root canal, and preventing apical extrusion
    of irrigant, thereby enhancing the success of root canal treatment [16, 17, 28].
    In contrast to traditional positive pressure irrigation, which pushes irrigating
    solutions into the canal, ANPI creates a suction effect. This suction ensures
    that the irrigating solution reaches the entire length of the canal, including
    the apical third, without forcing fluids or debris beyond the root apex into the
    periapical tissues. ANPI leverages negative pressure to enhance the removal of
    infected material, pus, and debris from within the lesion, promoting a more effective
    healing process by alleviating the build-up of pressure and facilitating the clearance
    of pathological contents [19, 28]. Fluid dynamics research has shown that ANPI
    microcapsules can create fluid flow in the ramification and establish negative
    apical pressure values for effective decompression of the LCPL [13]. However,
    it is important to note that ANPI may not be available in all dental practices,
    limiting patient access to this treatment option. In our study, we achieved positive
    results by using simple instruments based on the principles of the ANPI for clinical
    application. The advantages of our method include its simplicity, cost-effectiveness,
    and ease of use in clinical practice. The study’s flow rate was based on commercially
    available ANPI devices [16, 20]. However, this modified system still requires
    further refinement to optimize its clinical utility. The reported success rates
    of NSRCTs in many studies vary between 70.9% and 90.9% [3, 29, 30]. These discrepancies
    can be attributed to differences in techniques, criteria for treatment success,
    length of follow-up time, and other factors. Success rates are influenced by various
    anatomical factors and treatment methods. One common reason for NSRCT failure
    is perceived leakage around the canal filling material and missing canals [31].
    The use of a microscope can aid in locating missing canals and visualizing root
    obstructions [32, 33]. The incorporation of ultrasonic instruments into endodontic
    procedures has significantly improved the removal of canal obstructions and the
    effectiveness of irrigation [34]. Teeth without periapical radiolucency tend to
    exhibit better outcomes [6, 35]. In our study, the overall success rate was 91.4%,
    which is higher than that of previously reported results. This finding suggested
    that the presence of LCPLs does not necessarily impact a tooth’s prognosis when
    combined with the ANPI. It is worth noting that our study considered teeth as
    the study unit, whereas another study used roots as units [36]. When considering
    tooth roots as study units, the success rate was 90.74%, which aligns with the
    existing results. This could be attributed to the large sample sizes in our study,
    which involved multiple roots of teeth. A recent prospective cohort study using
    CBCT imaging reported a success rate of 82.2%, which is lower than our findings.
    This discrepancy may be due to the aspiration-irrigation technique used in the
    previous study. This technique carries the potential risk of mucosal inflammation,
    persistent surgical site complications, and potential lesion reinfection [37].
    In contrast, the ANPI procedure used in our study effectively decompressed lesions
    and mitigated the risk of infection. Furthermore, the presence of a preoperative
    palatal cortical bone defect may have influenced osseous healing. The periosteum
    plays a critical role in endogenous bone repair and remodeling, acting as a reservoir
    of osteo-competent periosteum-derived progenitor cells [38]. Damage to the periosteum
    and erosion of the cortical bone could lead to delayed healing. Unlike previous
    studies, we excluded patients with cortical bone defects during patient selection,
    enhancing the reliability of the results and resulting in a greater success rate
    than in conventional studies. Both healed and healing patients were considered
    successful outcomes, while non-healed patients were considered failures [29].
    Our study differs from previous research in that we utilized CBCT scans to measure
    volumetric changes in LCPLs at the 6-month recall, enabling us to evaluate early
    treatment success. CBCT imaging is significantly more accurate at detecting the
    size, shape, and location of periapical lesions than is PA imaging. However, PA
    radiographs have limitations in consistently revealing the true nature and location
    of periradicular disease, especially when a bone lesion is within the cancellous
    bone and the overlying cortical bone is substantial [23]. Moreover, 30–45% of
    periapical lesions are missed in PA radiographs [39]. In one study in which lesion
    volumes were measured before and after root canal treatment, CBCT and PA imaging,
    respectively, showed successful outcomes for 55 (77.5%) and 63 (88.7%) roots [23].
    Another recent study reported that when retreatment outcomes were assessed using
    PA radiographs, the success rate was 93%, but in CBCT assessments, the success
    rate was lower, at 77% [40]. These findings suggest that CBCT may be a more reliable
    tool for assessing treatment outcomes. In our study, the postoperative volume
    of LCPLs was significantly smaller than the preoperative volume (p < 0.05). The
    mean percentage of lesion reduction was 77.0 (54.2–96.4)% at the 6-month follow-up.
    The observed volume change in our study aligns with previous findings reporting
    changes of 75% or 76.8% [3, 23]. The distinction lies in the timing of CBCT imaging.
    In our study, CBCT imaging was performed at the 6-month post-surgery mark, while
    a previous study conducted imaging between 10 and 37 months after the procedure
    [23]. The relatively short healing period during CBCT imaging in our study suggested
    that the lesion is likely to continue healing, resulting in a further decrease
    in volume over time. We anticipate that this study will yield even more promising
    results. Additionally, the consistent follow-up period for CBCT imaging enhances
    the scientific validity of this research. We investigated various patient and
    treatment factors, such as sex, age, jaw, type, retreatment, preoperative pain,
    lesion size, and number of roots, as well as treatment factors such as sealer
    extrusion. While several factors were associated with nearly a 15% difference
    in the success rate and the percentage of volumetric decrease, these variations
    were not statistically significant, except for patient age. Studies have suggested
    that tooth location (jaw) does not significantly affect the survival rate of NSRCT
    [3, 41]. Therefore, long-term NSRCT outcomes were not influenced by tooth location
    or type, which is consistent with our results. However, a previous study revealed
    that the frequency of potential failures varied based on the tooth’s location
    [31]. Leaky canals were the primary cause of anterior tooth failure, while missing
    canals were the primary cause of posterior tooth failure. The complex anatomy
    of molars makes access and visibility difficult, potentially increasing the likelihood
    of missing a canal, such as the second mesiobuccal canal of the maxillary molar
    [42]. Although it remains unclear whether tooth type and position affect NSRCT
    prognosis, it is evident that different teeth require different treatment interventions.
    Some studies suggest that older patients may have worse prognoses due to factors
    such as decreased bone density and compromised immune systems. Older patients
    may have a higher risk of complications during surgical or nonsurgical treatments
    [43, 44]. In our study, patients under 30 years of age had a significantly greater
    rate of NSRCT success, which is in line with the findings of several previous
    studies [44]. However, we could not draw similar conclusions regarding volumetric
    changes, possibly due to our small sample size. Biological differences between
    sexes could impact the healing process or response to treatment due to differences
    in hormonal levels, immune response, or bone density [45]. However, some clinical
    studies have shown that sex does not significantly affect the outcome of treatment
    for LCPLs [3, 46]. In this study, sex did not influence treatment outcomes, which
    is consistent with previous findings. Retreatment poses several challenges, such
    as removing the previous obturation material, correcting procedural errors from
    the initial treatment, locating missed canals, and eliminating potentially therapy-resistant
    bacteria. As a result of these challenges, the prognosis for patients receiving
    retreatment of normal teeth is generally less favorable than that for patients
    receiving initial treatment [33]. Nonetheless, our findings do not reveal this
    discrepancy, potentially due to the superior flushing efficiency and the lesion
    cavity decompression achieved through the ANPI within the root canal. The presence
    of preoperative pain is an important factor that influences the severity of the
    disease, diagnostic considerations, and treatment decision-making in clinical
    practice. However, neither current experimental results nor extensive follow-up
    studies have shown that preoperative pain significantly affects the outcome of
    endodontic treatment [29, 33, 47]. This is destined to be a challenging issue,
    as pain is a broad and multifaceted concept with variations in type, severity,
    and location. Therefore, research on pain may be conducted with a more nuanced
    classification system to yield meaningful results. Sealer extrusion is a common
    occurrence in root canal treatment [29]. In the present study, iRoot SP, known
    for being a bioceramic-based root canal sealer with outstanding biocompatibility
    and bioactivity, was utilized. According to our results, sealer extrusion did
    not affect the treatment outcome. The reason for this difference may be that iRoot
    SPs can generate hydroxyapatite in the presence of tissue fluid, thereby promoting
    the regeneration of periapical tissues. Moreover, it has antimicrobial properties,
    effectively preventing bacterial colonization within the root canal system [48,
    49]. The extrusion of biocompatible root canal filling materials does not impede
    the healing process of periapical tissues. However, few studies have directly
    examined the impact of the number of dental roots on endodontic therapy efficacy
    [47]. Conversely, researchers frequently examine various tooth positions and types.
    Whether the number of dental roots influences the outcome of nonsurgical treatment
    for LCPLs may vary depending on several factors, including the size and location
    of the lesion, the specific treatment approach, and the inherent anatomical complexities
    associated with multirooted teeth. However, the findings of this study did not
    yield a positive conclusion, aligning with previous research results [47]. A previous
    study indicated that the presence of preoperative radiolucency was not a significant
    predictor of NSRCT success but suggested that larger lesions may require longer
    follow-up periods [35]. Another study revealed that nonsurgical management can
    effectively control the progression of LCPLs (> 10 mm) but revealed no preoperative
    factors related to treatment failure [3]. In this study, we also investigated
    the efficacy of NSRCT for lesions with a diameter > 10 mm, and our results were
    85.71%. This result is larger than that of a previous study (82.2%). Although
    the success rate of NSRCT with a diameter < 10 mm was nearly 10% greater than
    that of other stents, no significant difference was observed. One study revealed
    that treating lesions with a diameter < 5 mm had significantly greater success
    than treating lesions with a diameter > 5 mm [29, 50]. This may be due to the
    decreased availability of osteoblast progenitors in larger lesions and the increased
    likelihood of such lesions being cystic [50]. Given the retrospective design and
    limited sample size of the study, it is challenging to establish whether lesion
    size significantly affects NSRCT efficacy. Conclusion Despite the limitations
    of being an observational case-series study with a small sample size, our positive
    results obtained using the ANPI in the NSRCT suggest that it may be a promising
    approach for treating LCPLs. Furthermore, our findings indicate that patients
    under 30 years of age may have a higher success rate with NSRCTs. These results
    can guide the design of future clinical trials with more precise power analyses
    to further investigate the efficacy of this technique. Data availability The original

    255 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda

    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi

    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates

    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power

    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table

    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So

    fermented milk with better compositional content. Introduction The one humped
    camel was domesticated about 3000 B.C. in southern Arabia mainly for its meat
    and milk [1]. There is strong believes that dromedary camels entered to Meroe
    from Egypt, following either the River Nile or through the desert. This based
    on a specimen of camel hair rope of an old Kingdom, which was found at Fayum in
    upper Egypt 2980-2475 BC [2]. Meroe was the southern capital of the Napata/Meroitic
    Kingdom in Sudan that spanned the period c. 800 BC–c. 350 AD. Meroe plaque showed
    the existing of camel during that time and the oldest evidence is a bronze figure
    of a camel with a saddle dated back to 25–15 BC [2, 3]. Meanwhile, it was stated
    that the camels were probably entered the Sudan through the following routes:
    Egyptian route, North West African route during the 4–6 century and more recently
    the red sea route [4]. The bulk of camel population in the Sudan is found mainly
    in the arid and semi-arid parts of the country north of latitude 13 N°; camel
    belt [5]. The camel belt extends from 12 N° to 16 N°. The camel pastoralists are
    always moving over large area in search of food and water for their camels [6].
    Generally, the camel types found in Darfur move north and south, to avoid the
    clay soil and Tsetse fly found at the southern part of the country during the
    rainy season, while searching for water and food [7]. Also, camel is vital to
    daily life for those people living in the desert, as a source of food, means of
    transportation and as medicines for diverse ailments since ancient times [8].
    Camel milk is often the only regular food source for camel''s owners and nomadic
    people [6]. The pastoralists rely on this milk throughout the year as it may contribute
    up to 50% of their nutrient [9]. Moreover, the camel milk besides being one of
    the main components of the pastoral community’s basic staple diet in some areas
    of Africa and Asia [10, 11], it has significant health promoting values [10, 12,
    13]. Hence it is common in these regions to recommend consumption of camel milk;
    either in a fresh or sour state [11, 14,15,16] in order to control diabetes and
    its complications [17]. Consumption of camel milk and its products are associated
    with antidiabetic, anti-cancerous, anti-hypertensive and many other health benefiting
    properties [18]. This because when camel milk composition is comparable to that
    of cow milk, it has predominant medium-chain fatty acids in fat, low lactose,
    and abundant vitamin C and iron [18]. Similar to most pastoral societies, camel
    milk is traditionally consumed in fermented forms in Sudan [14, 15, 19–22]. Because
    in Sudan, the camel’s milk being abundant in remote localities; the camel herders
    living in the arid and semi-arid regions have to prepare Gariss; upon which they
    sustain their live for several months as a sole source of various nutrients [14,
    15, 19, 20]. Gariss is a sour special full cream fermented camel milk in Sudan
    and the word Gariss locally means ̒pinching΄ or stinging, denoting a high degree
    of sourness, although this is not necessarily true all the time [14, 15]. Suusac
    in Somali and Kenya [23], and Shubat in Asia [24] are the examples of similar
    products. Gariss can be continuously produced for months in a large skin bag or
    Siin that contains previously soured product called starter to which fresh milk
    is added whenever part of the fermented product has been consumed [14, 15, 19,
    20]. Siin usually is made after removing hair from goat skin and tanned using
    several local materials for its softening. In rural areas it is used as a manual
    churner for separating butter and butter milk. In the absence of a starter from
    a previous lot; particularly when using a new Siin; fermentation is initiated
    by adding a few seeds of black cumin and one onion bulb to produce the first batch
    of Gariss, then fresh camel milk is added to the Siin and usually, two large skin
    bags are used for the production of fermentation milk by tiding and hanging them
    on the saddle of special camel; called the camel Gariss [14, 15, 19]. Fermentation
    of milk into Gariss takes place while the camels are moving and due to the inherent
    jerk in the camel’s walk; the milk in the bags is gently shaken during fermentation,
    which is attributed to lactic acid bacteria and alcohol-producing yeasts [14,
    22]. In the Sudan, the ethnicity of camels and fermented camel milk is evidence
    in the ownership of camel and its husbandry management as well as utilization
    of its products. The nomadic tribes, especially those practiced complete nomadis,
    are usually move together including all family members following certain known
    routes, where the camels enjoy natural free pasture [21]. Commonly, the Sudanese
    camels are classified based on their conformational and tribal ownership [7].
    Moreover, the socio-economic characteristics of nomadic camel herders revealed
    more or less similar pattern, while the special cultures and tradition of each
    tribe are conserved and honored for the sustainable livelihood [21]. Most of nomadic
    camel herder''s families live in small tents made of different local materials
    including wool, wood and plastic materials and that every tent contains one leather
    bag for water and another one for preparation of Gariss [21, 25]. Women camel
    herders in nomadic production system are usually processed camel milk into Gariss
    for their households mostly using Siin and Bokhsa; wooden Gourd [20]. However,
    in the field it is prepared by shepherds when driving the camel for pastures in
    far-away places using 2 leather bags of tanned goat skin that carried on the back
    of the camel [19]. Fermented camel products generally have a longer shelf life
    than the original milk from which they are made [19, 26, 27]. Gariss is of great
    significant values due to its nutritional content, social impact and as a source
    of income [6]. Nomadic herders in most areas of Sudan don’t usually sell camel
    milk and they are against the concept of selling milk as they believed that it
    is a gift from the God that should never been sold [21]. Never the less, some
    of the eldery women from the Shanabla tribe when they are around El Obied city;
    during dry seasons; they sell fermented camel milk in the local markets in order
    to satisfy the basic needs of their households [25]. However, most of produced
    milk is used to satisfy household and herders needs, or sometimes it is offered
    for free to people who need it for medicinal purposes [28]. When used to cure
    leishmaniasis or kalazar; an adult man who contacts the protozoal disease of the
    belly as well as other illness is sent out with the camel boys in remote pasture
    lands to live on Gariss alone as food for weeks or months unless he is fully cured
    [14]. However, when a woman or a child or an elderly person catches the infection,
    Gariss (or camel milk rob) of a special kind is made for the patient; at home;
    by mixing milk with 12 kinds of spices, then the mixture is fermented for 3 days
    in a pot that buried in the ground and the person to be treated is fed on this
    product; alone; for 12 days as cure [15]. Although Gariss is the main stable food
    produced by the nomads, no study was performed to evaluate its compositional content
    in North Darfur State that considered as one of the important state for rearing
    camels in Sudan. Thus, this study was designed to fill in this gap by evaluating
    some of the factors contributing to variation in the chemical composition of Gariss
    produced by nomadic camel herders located in Al-koma Locality, North Darfur State.
    Materials and methods The study area and Gariss samples collection The area of
    study is Al-Koma Locality, North Darfur State, Sudan during February 2018. Gariss
    that was already prepared by nomadic camels’ herders as their basic food was investigated.
    The samples (n = 118) were obtained from four locations (Fig. 1); Sari (n = 30),
    Om Hageleeg (n = 30), Om Alhussain (n = 30) and Al-Koma (n = 28). The camels are
    browsing on the grass land and trees without any supplementary feeding, except
    in Al-Koma town, where the camels that kept inside the city are provided with
    extra feed or leftovers. The watering intervals for camels (Fig. 2) vary between
    10 to 14 days. Gariss samples were collected into 50 ml clean sterilized containers
    from the original containers in which the samples were prepared by the camel herders.
    The containers used include Siin; traditional tanned goat skin; Bokhsa; Gourd,
    stainless steel and plastic containers (Figs. 3, 4). All the samples were packed
    into an ice container and transported to the laboratory of Dairy Chemistry at
    the Department of Dairy Production, Faculty of Animal Production, University of
    Khartoum for conducting the analysis. Fig. 1 Sudan is located in the north eastern
    region of Africa, the greenish area showed the camel belt, however camels are
    also found outside this zone. The study areas in Al-Koma Locality in North Darfur

    tent; nomadic house Full size image Chemical analysis of Gariss The total solids
    content of Gariss samples were determined according to the modified method of
    AOAC [29]. Five ml of Gariss samples were pre-heated on a steam bath for 10–15
    min and then dried in an air oven for 3 h at 100 °C, after which they were transferred
    into a desiccator to cool and then weighted. Heating, cooling and weighting were
    repeated several times until the differences between the two successive weighting
    was less than 0.5 mg. The total solids content was calculated as follow: where
    W1: weight of sample after drying, W2: weight of the original sample. The fat
    content was performed by the Gerber method [30]. Ten milliners of sulfuric acid
    (density 1.815 g/ml at 20 °C) were poured into a clean dry Gerber tube, followed
    by the addition of 10.94 ml of Gariss sample. Then one ml of amyl alcohol (density
    0.814–0.816 g/ml at 20 °C) and distilled water (at 20 °C) were added. The content
    was then thoroughly mixed till no white particles could be seen. The Gerber tubes
    were centrifuged at 1100 revolution per minute (rpm) for 3 min and the tubes were
    then transferred into a water bath at 65 °C for 3 min. The fat percent was then
    read out directly from the fat column. The protein content was determined by Kjeldahl
    method [29]. In clean dry Kjeldahl flask, 10 ml of Gariss sample were placed followed
    by the addition of catalyst powder (Na2So4 and the equivalent of 0.1 mg Hg). Twenty
    five milliners of concentrated sulfuric acid (density 1.86 g/ml at 20 °C) were
    added to the flask and the mixture was then digested on a digestion heater until
    a clear solution was obtained (3 h). The flasks were then removed and left to
    cool. The digested samples were poured into volumetric flasks (100 ml) and diluted
    to 100 ml with distilled water. Five milliners were taken and neutralized using
    10 ml 40% NaOH. The distillate was received into a conical flask containing 25
    ml of 2% boric acid and 3 drops of 0.1 indicators (bromocresol green and methyl
    red). The distillation was continued until the volume in the flask was 75 ml.
    The flask was then removed from the desiccator and was titrated against HCl (0.1N)
    until the end point was obtained (red color). The protein content was calculated
    as follows: where T: Titration figure, 0.1: Normality of HCl, 0.014: Atomic weight
    of nitrogen, 20: Dilation factor. The ash content was determined using oven draft
    method [29]. Five ml of Gariss sample were weighted into a suitable clean dry
    crucible and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The crucibles were placed
    in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 1.5–2 h. It was cooled in a desiccator and weighted.
    The ash content was then calculated as follow: where W1 = weight of ash, W2 = weight
    of sample. The pH of Gariss samples was determined directly using pH meter Microprocessor
    mark (HANNA pH 210, India) according to Bradley [30]. Statistical analysis The
    collected data were subjected to analysis of variance using one way ANOVA for
    the compositional content of Gariss samples using SPSS (Statistical Package for
    Social Sciences) version 11.5. The mean separation was done using Duncan Multiple
    Range Test [31]. The significant differences was considered at (P < 0.05). Results
    Compositional content of Gariss obtained from camel herders in Al-Koma Locality
    Total solids content The obtained overall mean of the total solids content revealed
    7.35 ± 0.22% for Gariss samples produced by the camel herders in the 4 locations
    of Al-Koma Locality. The samples from Sari area showed the highest total solids
    (8.35 ± 0.28%) and those from Om-Alhussain area showed the lowest content (6.70 ± 0.35%)
    as shown in Table 1. Moreover, the total solids content of Gariss samples recorded
    significant (P < 0.05) variations between the area from which the samples were
    collected (Table 1). Table 1 Chemical composition of fermented camel milk “Gariss”
    obtained from four different locations in Al-koma Locality, North Darfur State
    Full size table Fat content Significant differences (P < 0.05) for the fat content
    were found between Gariss samples prepared by the camel herders in the 4 locations
    of Al-Koma Locality (Table 1). The fat content was high in Gariss samples obtained
    from Om-Hageleeg area (2.91 ± 0.21%) followed by those collected from Sari (2.71 ± 0.09%)
    compared to the samples obtained from Al-Koma (2.5 ± 0.14%) and Om Alhussain (2.25 ± 0.16%).
    The average mean revealed 2.58 ± 0.08% (Table 1). Protein content The overall
    mean for protein content of Gariss samples obtained from the camel herders was
    1.86 ± 0.04%. The samples from Om-Hageleeg area showed significantly (P < 0.05)
    higher protein content (2.08 ± 0.01%) compared to the samples of Gariss collected
    from Sari (1.91 ± 0.05%), Al-Koma (1.71 ± 0.07%) and Om-Alhussain (1.70%) as shown
    in Table 1. Ash content The mean of ash content for all Gariss samples collected
    from camel herders in Al-Koma Locality revealed 0.67 ± 0.01% (Table 1). The Gariss
    samples obtained from Al-Koma area showed the highest ash content (0.69 ± 0.02%),
    while samples that collected from Om-Hageleeg area showed the lowest mean (0.65 ± 0.04%).
    However, non-significant (P > 0.05) difference was found for ash content of Gariss
    from different chosen areas of Al-Koma Locality. pH The average value for the
    pH of Gariss samples collected from the camel herders in the 4 locations in Al-Koma
    Locality was 3.77 ± 0.03. The samples from Al-Koma area revealed the highest pH
    value (3.88 ± 0.08), while Gariss samples that collected from Om-Alhussain area
    showed the lowest one (3.66 ± 0.6). Non significant (P > 0.05) difference was
    obtained for pH of Gariss samples collected from the 4 investigated areas of Al-Koma
    Locality (Table 1). Compositional content of Gariss samples prepared in different
    containers by camel herders in Al-koma Locality The present result showed non-significant
    (P > 0.05) variations for the compositional content of Gariss prepared and kept
    into different containers (Table 2). The total solids content was high in Gariss
    samples collected from Siin (7.70 ± 0.71%) compared to that obtained from stainless
    steel (7.50 ± 0.00%), Bokhsa (7.35 ± 2.95%) and plastic containers (7.30 ± 0.23%)
    as shown in Table 2. Also, the fat content of Gariss was high in samples obtained
    from Siin (2.60 ± 0.19%), while the fat content of Gariss prepared using plastic
    containers, stainless steel and Bokhsa revealed 2.58 ± 0.08%, 2.4 ± 0.00% and
    2.40 ± 1.3%, respectively (Table 2). Moreover, the result in Table 2 showed that
    the highest protein value was found in Gariss samples prepared in Siin (2.02 ± 0.18%)
    compared to the protein content of Gariss prepared using plastic containers (1.85 ± 0.04%),
    stainless steel (1.69 ± 0.09%) and Bokhsa (1.48%). However, the ash content of
    Gariss samples collected from Bokhsa showed the highest value (0.68 ± 0.04%) followed
    by those prepared using Siin (0.67 ± 0.15%) and stainless steel containers (0.67 ± 0.00%)
    compared to that made using plastic containers (0.55 ± 0.03%) as shown in Table
    2. Meanwhile, the highest pH of Gariss was found in the samples prepared using
    stainless steel containers (3.95 ± 0.65) compared to that prepared in Bokhsa (3.80 ± 0.10),
    plastic containers (3.78 ± 0.03) and Siin (3.61 ± 0.11) as shown in Table 2. Table

    Effect of watering interval of camels on the compositional content of Gariss processed
    by camel herders in Al-Koma Locality The data in Table 3 showed the effect of
    the watering interval of camels on the compositional content of Gariss. There
    were significantly higher values for protein (P < 0.001), fat (P < 0.01) and total
    solids (P < 0.05) contents of Gariss. The total solids content of Gariss prepared
    using milk from camels that drink water every 14 days was 7.91 ± 0.29%, while
    it was 6.79 ± 0.03% in Gariss using milk from camels that drink water every 10
    days (Table 3). The study showed that the value of fat content of Gariss prepared
    using milk from camels that drink water every 14 days was 2.80 ± 0.11%, while
    it was 2.37 ± 0.10% for the Gariss prepared using milk from camels with drinking
    water intervals of 10 days. The percentage of protein in milk of camels drinking
    every 10 days was less than the camels drinking water every 14 days. The protein
    content of Gariss prepared from milk of camels with drinking frequency of water
    every 14 days was high (1.99 ± 0.05%) compared to those of Gariss prepared using
    camels milk with frequency of drinking water every 10 days (1.71 ± 0.05%) as shown
    in Table 3. However the ash content of Gariss prepared using milk from camels
    that drink water at intervals of 10 days revealed 0.68 ± 0.02% compared to the
    Gariss samples prepared from milk of camels that drink water every 14 days (0.67 ± 0.02%).
    The pH of Gariss prepared from milk of camels that drink water every 10 days was
    3.77 ± 0.05, while in the Gariss prepared using milk of camels that drink water
    every 14 days was 3.78 (Table 3). The present data showed non-significant (P > 0.05)
    differences in both ash and pH values as affected by watering intervals of camels
    (Table 3). Table 3 Effect of watering interval of camels on chemical composition
    of Gariss in Al-Koma Locality, North Darfur State Full size table Discussion The
    result obtained from the analysis of the compositional content of the collected
    Gariss samples produced from the different areas of Al-Koma Locality revealed
    variations (Table 1). The compositional content of Gariss was affected by the
    management system of she camels as well as the preparation conditions [19]. Also,
    variations in the chemical composition due to the differences in the temperature
    and storage period of Gariss were reported [26]. Moreover, the chemical composition
    of Gariss samples collected during dry and rainy seasons from nomadic camel herders
    in Gadarif State, eastern Sudan showed significant differences [20]. The obtained
    values for the total solids content of Gariss samples were lower than those reported
    for the traditional Kenyan fermented camel milk; Suusac [32] and Sudanese camel
    milk Gariss samples examined previously [19, 20]. However, the present obtained
    values were in the range of total solids content reported for the Gariss samples
    made in the laboratory [26] and those collected from transhumance camel herders
    in Sudan [19]. The lower total solids content obtained could be due to the high
    water content in camel milk [33]. Moreover, the availability of quality feed including
    the green fodder and the continuous water supply strongly influenced the total
    solids content of camel milk [33, 34] and consequently its fermented products
    that showed watery texture [27]. The fat content of Gariss samples from different
    locations of Al-Koma Locality were in a range of 2.25% and 2.91%, which supported
    the fat content (2.55%) reported in Gariss samples collected from Butana area
    of Sudan [26]. The result was also similar to the fat content of Dhanaan, which
    is Ethiopian fermented camel milk [35]. However, the fat content for the Gariss
    samples collected from transhumance camel herders was slightly higher [19]. Also,
    high fat content was reported for the Gariss samples collected during the dry
    and rainy seasons (3.73% ± 0.11 vs. 3.06% ± 0.22, respectively) from nomadic women
    herders in Al Gadarif State, Sudan [20]. Moreover, the fat content of Suusac in
    Kenya revealed 4% [32]. The differences might be due to the variations of the
    fat content in the milk used for production of the Gariss [19]. The lower values
    of camel milk fat that often associated with the traditional nomadic system might
    be due to lack of nutrient supplements [34]. However, Garris; is pleasantly sour
    product with a characteristic buttery flavor that is used as a common food in
    the rural areas of Middle and Western Sudan where it is drunk on its own or consumed
    with other food products by camels owners [22]. The protein content (1.70–2.08%)
    in the collected Gariss samples from different areas of Al-Koma Locality was in
    the range of protein content (2.32%) of fermented camel milk obtained in the laboratory
    [26]. Also, higher value for protein content of Gariss produced by nomadic herders
    was reported previously [19]. Moreover, it was lower than protein content (3.06%)
    of Gariss collected during the rainy and dry seasons [20]. Previously, it was
    reported that the availability of high feed quality explains the variations in
    milk protein content between camels kept in the different locations and production
    systems [33, 34]. The milk protein is very important especially for nomadic camel
    herders because it is the only source of protein for providing sufficient amount
    of amino acids in their relatively poor environment [36]. The ash content of Gariss
    collected samples from the four different choosen areas of Al-Koma Locality were
    found to range between 0.65 and 0.69%, which were lower than the average ash content
    of the fermented camel milk reported previously [26]. However higher ash content
    of Gariss was also reported [19]. Meanwhile, lower ash content of Gariss collected
    from Al Gadarif State was found during rainy and dry seasons [20]. The variations
    reported could be due to the differences in the locations, production systems
    [19] and the processing method [20]. The result showed that pH value (3.66–3.88)
    of Gariss samples collected from Al-Koma Locality were in the range of pH reported
    in Gariss examined previously [19, 26]. Meanwhile, values of 4.42; 1.72% and 1.40%
    for the pH, titratable acidity and ethanol content of Gariss, respectively, were
    reported in a previous study [22]. Also, similar pH value was reported for Gariss
    samples collected from Al Gadarif State during the dry season [20]. However, the
    pH was 4.52 ± 0.20 during the rainy season, which could be due to the continuous
    addition of fresh milk that was available during autumn season; as the camels
    are rearing very near to their owners [20]. Generally the fermentation of milk
    via the action of microorganisms result in lowering the pH values [27]. The low
    obtained pH values could be due to the type of camel milk, as; locally; Gariss
    means sour and it is kept to be fermented continuously by adding some fresh milk
    [19]. Fermented camel milk in Sudan is also known as hameedh or humadah, which
    also means sour [20]. These differences in pH ranges can also be explained by
    the duration of storage and the degree of fermentation temperature [27]. Generally
    the variations found in the compositional content of Gariss (Table 1) might also
    be due to the differences in the preparation methods of camel’s milk products
    [15, 20, 27, 35] and their storage conditions [20, 26, 27, 37]. The obtained differences
    could also be due to variations of geographical locations, milk composition and
    seasons [20, 33] and feeding conditions of the milking camels [33] as well as
    the method of Gariss processing and preservation [20]. Table 2 shows variations
    in the total solids, fat and protein content between Gariss prepared in Siin and
    other containers. The variations in the chemical composition of Gariss samples
    might be due to the types of used containers. A previous data revealed that 42.1%
    of nomadic women camel herders are using either Siin or plastic containers; however
    the use of Bokhsa and stainless steel containers for preparing Gariss revealed
    10.5% and 5.3% in Al Gadarif State [20]. Bokhsa and Siin were only used by women
    in Al-Koma Locality. The slight variations observed in the chemical composition
    (Table 2) could be attributed to the similar processing conditions practiced.
    The higher values obtained for Gariss prepared using Siin matches with the lower
    pH, which is due to the rate of fermentation (Table 2), which is high when using
    Bokhsa due to the lack of adding fresh milk. Siin followed by Bokhsa and the plastic
    containers keep the products original temperature compared to stainless steel
    containers that absorbed the heat more compared to the other used containers.
    Furthermore, the temperature is the most important factor in controlling the growth
    of the fermentative microorganisms in the milk and dairy products [37]. When the
    values of total solids are high, this might be because the herders usually remove
    the upper watery part; resulted from wheying off; of Gariss in order to substitute
    their need for drinking water, which is lacking in such environment. Similar observation
    was reported during the dry seasons [20]. The seasonal systemic movement of camel
    herders is because of climate conditions coupled with the lack of water [28].
    This lack of water affected both humans and the animals. The data concerning the
    pH (Table 2) showed that the lowest value was in Gariss prepared using Siin (3.61).
    The obtained value was lower than that reported (4.42) for the pH of Gariss examined
    previously [20]. This low pH could be due to the variations of camel milk, type
    of containers used and the temperature, which showed direct effect on the pH values.
    The low pH values of Gariss indicate major contribution of lactic acid bacteria
    and yeast in the fermentation [15]. Similarly, significantly (P < 0.05) low pH
    was found when comparing Gariss that was prepared using stainless steel (3.95 ± 0.45),
    plastic containers (3.59 ± 0.16), Siin (3.87 ± 0.16) and Bokhsa (4.55 ± 0.31)
    [20]. These findings suggested that Bokhsa is a good container to be used by the
    nomadic herders where there is no alternative for proper storing of fermented
    products. The present study (Table 3) showed significant variations in the compositional
    content of Gariss as was affected by the watering interval of she camels whose
    milk was used for preparing Gariss. This result is in agreement with those reported
    earlier [19, 35]. Camel milk yield and composition were significantly affected
    by husbandry practices including watering intervals [38]. Camel milk is regularly
    processed into Gariss, as it was noticed that drinking fresh unprocessed camel
    milk is very rare among nomads because they believe that Gariss is much healthier
    [21, 25]. The variations in the chemical composition of camel milk might be attributed
    to many factors based on the physiological and environmental conditions such as
    the species of camel, age and heath condition, difference in genotype, seasonal
    conditions and parity of camel [39]. Moreover, other factors include ecological
    localities for camels, water availability and green fodders [34, 38], in addition
    to stage of lactation and fermentation period [40, 41]. Furthermore, fresh camel
    milk and their products have unique flavor and good nutritional values, therefore
    they can compete in the market if made available on supermarket shelves and packed
    into an attractive packaging [12]. It is also important that final products should
    have acceptable sensory attributes such as taste, aroma, color and texture during
    their shelf life. Conclusion Gariss consumed in Al-Koma Locality has good compositional
    content, moreover, the chemical composition was found to be affected by the watering
    intervals of the camels, locations and the containers used. The best recommended
    containers according to the present study are the ethnic Siin and Bokhsa to prepare
    and store fermented camel milk. This study recommends the benefiting from camel
    milk and fermented products; produced in the desert and semi-desert areas; to
    the urban consumers to take the advantage of the value of camel milk as organic
    and functional food. Availability of data and materials The data generated during
    the current study will be available upon request. Abbreviations AOAC: Association

    production of crops depending on many factors including water, nutrient, soil
    types, climate and crops types, water stress and drought is in one of the important
    factors affecting crop productivity. The experiment was conducted in pots to evaluate

    height (125 cm), stem diameter (18.02 mm), leaf area (350 cm− 2), plant weight

    pots resulted in increased water use efficiency (0.44 g pot− 1 mm− 1) compared
    with no application (0.36 g pot− 1 mm− 1). It can be endorsed from the outcome
    that Bacillus inoculation increased plant biomass, root biomass of maize and water
    use efficiency during early growth stage of maize despite of water stress and
    can be used under limited water condition for crop combating during moderate to
    lower stress conditions. Peer Review reports Introduction Maize is one of the
    vital cereals crops after wheat and rice grown in wide range of climates including
    tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. Likewise other cereals
    crops maize crop also faces many biotic and abiotic constraints during life cycle.
    These include insect pest infestation, diseases, drought and nutrients deficiency
    [1]. Among these factors drought stress has considerable effect on crop growth
    and development [2]. Water is an important integral part of the plants, plays
    important role in maintaining growth, turgidity and acts as a reagent in plant
    cells. Water stress is the most prominent abiotic stress that has a significant
    effect on crop productivity in agriculture lands around the globe. Increasing
    population and changing climate are likely to increase water scarcity by declining
    water sources, which will leads to decline in crop productivity in the world [3].
    The researchers makes it very clear that reducing irrigation causes large losses
    in yield in maize. However, in some circumstances, this form of water deficit
    may allow for water savings through reduced irrigation water use at little yield
    cost [4]. Since these cropping and irrigation conditions are comparable to those
    that local farmers face, it is crucial to understand how the crops will react
    to a moderate water shortfall. As a result of osmotic stress, plant cells produce
    more solution metabolites to avoid a water shortage and a drop in turgor pressure.
    The metabolites, which include nitrogen components like proline and other amino
    acids, polyamines, and ammonium, build as a result of osmotic adjustment [5].
    Organic solutions accumulate up in the cytosol and are crucial for osmotic regulation
    and cell retention, while a moisture deficit increases [6]. Physiological and
    biochemical alternation coordinated at the cellular and molecular levels results
    in drought resistance. Osmotic adjustment and more rigid cell walls could be part
    of these changes. Plant growth and productivity are negatively impacted by abiotic
    stress, which induces a range of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and
    molecular changes [7]. Drought tolerance mechanisms can be classified into three
    broad categories such as drought escape, drought avoidance, and biochemical tolerance
    of the tissues to water deficit [8]. Plants ability to withstand drought was demonstrated
    by the Cell Membrane Stability (CMS) experiment, which measures the integrity
    of cell membranes [9]. Maize has been shown to be extremely susceptible to drought
    [10]. The leaf area index were determined by [11] to be decreased by the degree
    of water stress. Likewise, deficit irrigation planning for maize is challenging
    without lowering production [12]. Deficit irrigation is a scheduling approach
    in which irrigation is purposely carried out so that the crop’s water requirements
    are not entirely met, and plants are allowed to take soil moisture above the water
    that is easily accessible in the plant roots [13]. Inoculating plants with plant
    growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has been proven to protect them from a variety
    of abiotic stresses [14,15,16]. Previous research in the literature have demonstrated
    that Burkholderia spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudumonas spp., Azospirillum spp., and
    Rhizobium spp. reduce the severity of drought in wheat, barley, maize, and beans
    [17,18,19]. However, the PGPB’s mode of action can be direct or indirect, and
    it can encourage plant growth in both stressful and non-stressful situations [20,
    21]. The current experimental trial was planned to evaluate the impact of Bacillus
    spp. and deficit irrigation during early growth stage (vegetative) of maize crop.
    Materials and methods The experiment was performed in glass house located at research
    site of Isparta University of Applied Sciences Isparta, Turkey in 2022. Experimental
    trial was conducted in Completely Randomized Design having 3 replications and
    a total of 24 pots were used (Fig. 1). Factorial experiment of 2 factors (Irrigation
    and Bacillus) were performed. Irrigation levels were (no stress: 100% (I1) and
    deficit irrigation: 75 (I2), 50 (I3), 25 (I4) % of required water amount to reach
    pot capacity). The product of Biotrinsic FP-30 (Bacillus spp. based strain) was
    obtained from Indigo Turkey. Based on company recommendations (36 mg (milligram)
    per 100 mg of seed) were applied. In this experiment the variety KWS Kerubino
    hybrid (Zea mays L., indentata) was used which is classified as strong grain variety
    in the FAO 570 mortality group and has a broad-leaved, thick and robust stem,
    and a body structure that is resistant to lodging. It is highly adaptable to different
    climatic and environmental conditions. The seed were inoculated with Bacillus
    strain prior to seeding in the pot. Total of 250 gram of seeds were inoculated
    with 0.072 mg of Bacillus. After inoculation, the seeds were mixed thoroughly
    for while followed by sowing. Fig. 1 Overview of the experiment Full size image
    Required amount of fertilizers (Nitrogen-Phosphorus) was calculated from MAP (Mono
    ammonium phosphate) and AS (Ammonium sulphate). During sowing, phosphorus was
    applied at a rate of 100 kg ha− 1 and nitrogen at a rate of 200 kg ha− 1 (50%
    at sowing and 50% at 30–40 cm height stage). Each pot of 7 kg soil was applied
    with 0.45 gram of MAP for phosphorus. The applied amount of nitrogen was calculated
    (1.3 gram N from MAP) the rest of nitrogen was calculated from AS. Each pot was
    supplied with 5.33 gram of AS as nitrogen base fertilizers @ 100 kg ha− 1. The
    rest of half dose nitrogen was applied at 30–40 cm height stage of crop (40 days
    after sowing). The examined soil properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1
    Soil physiochemical properties Full size table All pots of the experiment were
    weighted for their initial weight and were filled with equal amount of soil. The
    volume of the pot was calculated as 742 cm− 3 (surface area as 0.28 m− 2). After
    seeding all the pots were irrigated with same amount of water and the field capacity
    of the pot were measured (approx. 24 h after irrigation). Afterward the remaining
    irrigations were performed based on water usage (evapotranspiration). All the
    pots of experimental trial were followed on daily basis for their weight and moisture
    loss and irrigation were performed according with the base amount of water (field
    capacity-2230 ml) by keeping the levels of irrigation under the consideration.
    Based on basal application of water the amount was decreased accordingly for all
    the treatments. Afterward, the irrigation was performed based on 30% moisture
    loss from the no stress treatments (I1) by weighing the pots. Using [22] equation
    for the soil water balance, evapotranspiration (ET) from each pot was calculated
    (Eq. 1). (1) Where ET stands for evapotranspiration, I for irrigation water depth,
    P for precipitation, Cp for capillary rise, Dp for deep percolation, Rf for runoff
    loss, and S for change in soil water content. Hence, there was no precipitation,
    capillary rise, deep percolation and runoff loss as the study was carried out
    in glasshouse. Downward flux below the crop root zone that was neglected because
    the lower side of every pot was covered with plastic bag in order to avoid drainage
    loss. The amount of evapotranspiration was equal to the irrigation was applied.
    Therefore, Eq. 1 was simplified to Eq. 2: (2) Equation 3 were used to compute
    the water usage efficiency (WUE) in the treatments [23, 24] (3) Where, WUE is
    water use efficiency, FBa is actual fresh biomass obtained and ET is evapotranspiration.
    To determine the relationship between a relative decrease in evapotranspiration
    and a relative decrease in yield Eq. 4 was employed [25]. (4) Where, Ky is the
    yield response factor, ETa and ETm are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration
    (mm), and FBa and FBm are the actual and maximum fresh biomass, respectively.
    After 60 days the crop was harvested, fresh and dry biomass, plant height (cm),
    stem diameter (mm), leaf area (cm− 2) root length (cm), root fresh and dry weight,
    were measured. Scale was used to measure plant height and root length, digital
    calliper to measure stem diameter, and digital weight balance to measure plant
    weight. Equation 5 was used to calculate relative water content [26]. (5) Where,
    RWC stands for relative water content. DW stands for Dry weight, FW for Fresh
    weight, and TW for Turgid weight. The experiment was laid out for 2 months between
    31st June-31st August. Pots were placed at the center of glass house and were
    tagged with proper label of corresponding treatment (Fig. 1). After 60 days of
    the experiment, above soil biomass (plant part) was harvested and kept in the
    plastics bags to avoid evaporation loss for further analysis. Root of the plant
    was removed with proper care from the pots by applying water in order to ease
    the extraction and to avoid damage. Afterward the roots were analyzed for their
    length fresh and dry weight. The collected data were statistically examined using
    the analysis of variance method in accordance with a completely random design
    by using Statistix software (version 8.1). When the F-test was significant, the
    least significant differences (LSD) test was used to link data means [27]. Results
    Water use efficiency Water use efficiency (WUE) which is a measure of crop output
    per unit of applied water. The interactive values of both irrigation levels and
    bacteria were presented in Table 2 while the mean values of the individual treatments
    were presented in Table 4. The level of irrigation water that produced the maximum
    biomass (193 g pot− 1) and water use efficiencies (0.72 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was observed
    with application of I1 with bacteria. Keeping in consideration the least decline
    in biomass and WUE by the interactive effect of irrigation level I2 inoculated
    with bacteria (0.61 g pot− 1 mm− 1 WUE) when compared with 100% water level without
    bacteria there was no difference in water use efficiency and plant fresh biomass.
    Analysis of variance shows significant effect of irrigation levels and bacteria
    on water use efficiency of maize crop. Plants supplied with 100% irrigation water
    resulted in the highest WUE (0.67 g pot− 1 mm− 1) followed by I2 water application
    with WUE (0.56 g pot− 1 mm− 1) while the lowest WUE (0.08 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was
    recorded in pots applied with 25% water (Table 4). According to the results obtained
    from this study, the interactive effect of the both factors was not significant
    at different irrigation levels and Bacillus has influenced biomass of plant and
    WUE. Table 2 Interactive values of evapotranspiration, fresh biomass and water
    use efficiency (WUE), leaf area, plant dry biomass and relative water content
    Full size table Irrigation (evapotranspiration) relationships between fresh biomass
    Evapotranspiration and plant biomass yield have a linear relationship at 1% significant
    level (R2 = 0.963) as seen in Fig. 2. According to the findings of the study,
    the yield response factor (ky) was 1.43. This result illustrates that the maize
    fresh biomass (vegetative growth) was sensitive to water deficit. Fig. 2 Relationships
    between evapotranspiration (irrigation water used), and crop biomass (a) and the
    relationships between the relative evapotranspiration deficit and the relative
    yield decline for maize (b) Full size image Plant fresh biomass (g) Response of
    plant fresh biomass to various irrigation levels and biofertilizers is presented
    in Table 3. The effect of both irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant
    while the interactive effect of treatments was no significant. Plants applied
    with 100% of water (I1) produced more biomass (180.42 g) compared with I2 and
    I3 water application having fresh matter of (113 g) and (39.17 g) respectively.
    The growth and biomass of the plants were suppressed in case of 25% water application
    resulted in stunted growth and low biomass (5.63 g) production. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain produced more vigorous biomass (91.65 g) compared with seeds
    without any treatment of bacteria (77.31 g). Table 3 Growth attributes of maize
    as affected by irrigations levels and Bacillus spp Full size table Plant dry biomass
    (g) The effect of water application and Bacillus was found significant on plant
    dry biomass of maize plant (Table 3). Likewise, the interactive effect of biofertilizers
    and water application was also found significant. Application of 100% water showed
    more plant dry biomass (73.58 g) followed by 75% of water having dry matter of
    (47.58 g). Lowest plant dry biomass was observed in pots applied with 25% of water
    (2.20 g). Application of I1 water along with bacteria treatment resulted in pronounced
    effect with drier biomass followed by I2 water application and I3 water application.
    There were no significant differences among the means of bacterial and nonbacterial
    treatment (Table 3). Plant height (cm) The amount of irrigation had a substantial
    impact on maize plant height (P ≥ 0.05) as shown in Table 3. However, there was
    no significant effect of biofertilizers on the plant height. The interactive effect
    of the both factors was also non-significant. By mean comparison taller plants
    (125 cm) was recorded under well-watered condition (I1) followed by I2, I3 and
    I4 irrigation treatments which was (104 cm), (82) and (44 cm) respectively. Stem
    diameter (mm) The effect of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was found
    significant for the stem diameter of plant. Plants treated with 75% (I2) water
    of field capacity resulted in maximum stem diameter (20.85 mm) followed by I1
    irrigation (18.02 mm). Plants subjected to stress conditions (I4) was observed
    with thinner and weak stem diameter (7.86 mm). Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots treated with bacteria (B+) strains shows maximum stem diameter (15.67 mm)
    in comparison with control (B-) having stem diameter of (14.64 mm). The comparative
    effect of irrigation and biofertilizers was non-significant (Table 3). Leaf area
    (cm− 2) Leaf area of maize was significantly affected by both irrigation and biofertilizers.
    The interactive effect of the treatments was also recorded significant (Table
    3). Plants treated with I1 treatment were observed with maximum leaf area (350.72
    cm− 2) compared with deficit amount of water I2, I3 and I4 treatments with leaf
    area (258.84 cm− 2), (131.94 cm− 2) and (51.31 cm− 2), respectively. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain also affected leaf area of maize plant. Inoculated seeds
    with bacteria were observed with expanded and maximum leaf area (214.20 cm− 2)
    compared with non-inoculated pots with leaf area (182.20 cm− 2). Among the interactions,
    pots inoculated with bacteria and supplied with 100% water were observed to have
    more leaf area (386.00 cm− 2) in comparison to the rest of treatments (Fig. 4).
    Root length (cm) Both irrigation levels and biofertilizers has significant affected
    root length of maize plant. The interactive effect of irrigation and biofertilizers
    was found non significant (Table 3). Among irrigation levels plants treated with
    I1 water resulted in maximum root length (92.83 cm) followed by I2 treatment with
    root length of (78.75 cm) which was statistically not at far with I3 level of
    water application (74.83 cm). Plants supplied with limited water (I4) resulted
    in shorter root length (56.41 cm). Among biofertilizers, Bacillus inoculated plants
    were observed with maximum vigorous roots (79.20 cm) compared with control (72.20
    cm) treatment (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Root length of maize crop as affected by irrigation
    levels and bacteria Full size image Root fresh weight (g) The effect of irrigation
    and biofertilizers on fresh root of weight presented in Table 3. Significant effect
    of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was observed on fresh weight of
    root. The interactive effect of treatments was non significant. Pots applied with
    required amount of water (I1) were noted with more fresh matter (91.50 g) followed
    by I2 water application (69.83 g). Pots with least amount of water supply (I4)
    resulted in minimum fresh matter (6.29 g) production. Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots with inoculated strain of bacteria produced maximum root fresh weight (53.52
    g) compared with control without bacteria application (46.10 g). Root dry weight
    (g) The effect of irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant on
    the dry weight of roots Table 3. Interactive effect of both factors was found
    no significant. Application of water in demand of plant (I1/field capacity) resulted
    in more dry weight of roots (28.66 g) compared with I2 treatment with root dry
    weight of (21.25 g g). Pots subjected to stress conditions (I4) were observed
    with lowest root dry weight (3.00 g). Likewise, bacteria treated seed produced
    maximum root dry biomass (16.70) compared with non-treated seed/pots (14.08).
    Relative water content (%) Leaf relative water content as affected by irrigation
    levels and Bacillus inoculation is presented in Table 4. Irrigation and bacteria
    has significantly affected leaf relative water content. Integrative effect of
    both treatments was also significant. Plants applied with 50% (I3) water resulted
    in highest RWC (81.95%) followed by I2 water application. Lowest Leaf RWC was
    recorded in leaf of plants applied with 25% irrigation. Among bacterial treatments
    non inoculated plants had more RWC (74.20%) value compared with inoculated plants
    (68.88%). When the interactive values of both the treatments was compared highest
    RWC (84.81%) was recorded in plants inoculated with Bacillus spp. and I3 treatment
    which was statistically at far with those of non inoculated treatment and I3 level
    of irrigation (Fig. 4). Table 4 Relative water content (%) and water use efficiency

    Plant characteristics including height, leaf area, stem diameter, and fresh and
    dry weight as affected by irrigation levels and Bacillus specie are presented
    in Table 3. Among the irrigations, levels the growth parameters were significantly
    increased with the amount of irrigation water. In the case of 100% water application
    highest growth in plant height stem diameter leaf area were observed followed
    by 75% irrigation and so on. Shortest plant height was recorded in pots applied
    with 25% water. This was probably of more water availability to the crop as water
    is an important component of plant cell and play vital role in cell division,
    enlargement and turgidity of the cell. These findings are in line with those of
    [28] who stated that highest moisture is important for cell division and growth.
    Stem diameter values increased parallel to increasing irrigation water [29]. The
    effect of bacterial inoculated seeds were found only for the leaf area and plant
    fresh weight of maize crop. Bacillus spp. treated pots resulted in more expanded
    leaf area compared with control (without bacteria). This could be due to due to
    more roots formation as a result plant extracted more water led to more leaf area
    and foliage production. Number of leaves on maize increased by roughly 12.4% and
    8.3%, respectively, when plant growth-promoting bacteria were used as compared
    to the control [30]. Similar studies have been carried out and researchers determined
    that the growth hormones released by the bacteria were responsible for the increased
    cell length, cell growth, and cell division that resulted in an increase in the
    number of leaves. The interactive effect of the treatments were found no significant
    for all growth aspects except leaf area and plant dry biomass. Inoculated seeds
    with 100% water application resulted in highest leaf area followed by non inoculated
    seeds. Lowest leaf area was noted in non-inoculated plots supplied with 25% of
    water. The differences in the plant growth during vegetative growth may be related
    to the photosynthetic processes that are closely associated with leaf and whole
    biomass growth [31, 32]. Variability in roots characteristics of maize was measured
    as root length, root fresh and dry weight. Plant treated with 100% of irrigation
    was observed with highest root characteristics followed by 75% water application.
    Lowest root aspects was noted in plants treated with 25% water. The increase in
    root formation with water application possibly due to moist rhizosphere in pots
    as a result the plants had showed its potential of lengthening their roots. These
    outcomes are consistent with those reported by [33], who observed significant
    variation in roots of maize with deficit irrigation levels. Drought stress has
    a significant impact on root development, root properties, and behaviour [34].
    In addition, plants treated with Bacillus spp. (inoculated plants) had the longest
    roots and the heaviest roots in both fresh and dry weight when compared with control
    plants. Numerous studies have examined PGBs, notably Bacillus spp., which exhibit
    a variety of features that enable them to mobilize soil nutrients and synthesise
    phytohormones that promote plant growth [35,36,37]. Inoculated maize seeds with
    the PGPR Azospirillum lipoferum produced more root tips, more root branching,
    and longer cumulative roots [38]. By increasing the production of proline, amino
    acids, and soluble sugars, Bacillus spp. Inoculation mitigate the effects of drought,
    increase plant development, and improve soil water and nutrient uptake [39]. Water
    use efficiency as a tendency of water holding was significantly affected by irrigations
    levels. WUE increased as the level of irrigation increased which means, a lower
    level of biomass was produced per mm of water used by the plants compared with
    required amount of irrigations. Highest WUE was recorded in pots applied with
    100% of irrigation. Water use efficiency was decreased by decreasing the level
    of water from 100 to 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. Increase in WUE with increase
    in amount of irrigations could be due to more availability of water to the crop
    as a result plant has produced more biomass per unit of water applied. These results
    are consistent with those of [40], who reported significant increase in WUE with
    irrigation levels from low to high. The increase in WUE is a consequence of an
    overall decrease in plant transpiration caused on by a decrease in green leaf
    area as a result of the water shortage, which has probably reduced soil surface
    evaporation [41]. The combined variance analysis revealed that bacteria and irrigation
    practises both significantly impacted relative water content (RWC). Interactive
    effect of both treatments was also significant. Relative water content was decreased
    by increasing stress on plants. Highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants
    supplied with 50% irrigation followed by 75% and 100%. Plants exposed to stress
    conditions has shrinked and non turgor leaves when allow for water intake can
    restore their turgor therefore plants subjected to stress had highest relative
    water content. The findings of the current study accord with those of [42]. Among
    bacterial treatments, highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants having
    no inoculation in compared with inoculated plant leaves. In interactive effect
    of both treatments, highest RWC value was observed in inoculated plants applied
    with 50% irrigation which was statistical at par with non-inoculated treatment.
    During times of drought stress PGPB delay losses in leaf water potential, and
    speed up returns to control levels once water-limiting conditions are lifted [43].
    Conclusion It can be endorsed from the outcome that, under sufficient water conditions
    maize crop should be irrigated with the required amount of irrigation for obtaining
    maximum production. In case of limited conditions, water application can be minimized
    to moderate level up to 75% percent by alternate approach. In our study Bacillus
    spp. showed its pronounced effect in improving growth characters of maize crop.
    Bacillus spp. inoculation increased plant biomass, root biomass, and water use
    efficiency of maize plant during early growth stage of maize despite of water
    stress and can be used under limited water condition for crop combating during
    moderate to lower stress conditions. In addition to this, the yield response factor
    (ky) value in this study was determined as 1.43 (≥ 1) which demonstrates that,
    maize very sensitive to a lack of water in the soil during vegetative period.

  description: 'Purpose: In the conventional technique, viscoelastic agents are typically
    rinsed away with balanced salt solution (BSS), but it may lead to a series of
    complications such as viscoelastic residue, anterior chamber instability and intraoperative
    TICL rotation. The utilization of irrigation and aspiration (I/A) has been shown
    to be effective in maintaining anterior chamber stability, reducing the incidence
    of postoperative high intraocular pressure, and minimizing postoperative fundus
    complications. However, there is a lack of previous studies investigating the
    impact of I/A on corneal endothelial cells during ICL implantation. The objective
    of this study was to examine the effect of I/A on corneal endothelial cells in
    patients undergoing myopia correction through implantation of Implantable Collamer
    Lens with a central hole (V4c ICL). Methods: A retrospective selection was made
    of 344 eyes from 172 patients who underwent V4c ICL implantation and I/A to remove
    viscoelastic agent from the anterior chamber between 2021 and 2022. The intraocular
    pressure (IOP) was measured at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after surgery. Corneal endothelial
    cell density (ECD), coefficient of variation in cell size (CV), standard deviation
    of cell area (SD), and percentage of hexagonal cells (HEX) were evaluated at 1 week
    postoperatively to assess corneal endothelial cells. The first two represent polymegethism
    or morphological variation, while the third parameter represents the degree of
    polymorphism of the corneal endothelial cells. Electronic medical records were
    utilized for data collection purpose. Results: All surgeries proceeded without
    complications. The IOP was 16.50 ± 3.42 mmHg (range: 11.5–22.3 mmHg) prior to
    surgery and increased to 21.25 ± 5.61 mmHg (range: 9.5–34.8 mmHg), 19.85 ± 5.18 mmHg
    (range: 11.4–36.2 mmHg) and finally settled at an average of 18.81 ± 4.57 mmHg
    (range: 10.1–38.8 mmHg) at the respective time points of 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after
    surgery. The preoperative ECD was recorded as being approximately 3004 ± 295 cell/mm2,
    which exhibited a marginal decreased of 1.17% postoperatively, resulting in an
    average ECD value of 2969 ± 303 cell/mm2 one week after surgery (P = 0.12). Similarly,
    the preoperative CV was determined as 31.10 ± 3.78%, and it experienced a slight
    reduction with an average CV value of 30.74 ± 3.77% at week after surgery (P =
    0.21). And, the preoperative SD was reported as 104.76 ± 17.26, and it remained
    virtually unchanged with an average SD value of 104.85 ± 18.75 at one week after

    technique, viscoelastic agents are typically rinsed away with balanced salt solution
    (BSS), but it may lead to a series of complications such as viscoelastic residue,
    anterior chamber instability and intraoperative TICL rotation. The utilization
    of irrigation and aspiration (I/A) has been shown to be effective in maintaining
    anterior chamber stability, reducing the incidence of postoperative high intraocular
    pressure, and minimizing postoperative fundus complications. However, there is
    a lack of previous studies investigating the impact of I/A on corneal endothelial
    cells during ICL implantation. The objective of this study was to examine the
    effect of I/A on corneal endothelial cells in patients undergoing myopia correction
    through implantation of Implantable Collamer Lens with a central hole (V4c ICL).
    Methods A retrospective selection was made of 344 eyes from 172 patients who underwent
    V4c ICL implantation and I/A to remove viscoelastic agent from the anterior chamber
    between 2021 and 2022. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 1 h, 2 h
    and 3 h after surgery. Corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), coefficient of
    variation in cell size (CV), standard deviation of cell area (SD), and percentage
    of hexagonal cells (HEX) were evaluated at 1 week postoperatively to assess corneal
    endothelial cells. The first two represent polymegethism or morphological variation,
    while the third parameter represents the degree of polymorphism of the corneal
    endothelial cells. Electronic medical records were utilized for data collection
    purpose. Results All surgeries proceeded without complications. The IOP was 16.50 ± 3.42
    mmHg (range: 11.5–22.3 mmHg) prior to surgery and increased to 21.25 ± 5.61 mmHg
    (range: 9.5–34.8 mmHg), 19.85 ± 5.18 mmHg (range: 11.4–36.2 mmHg) and finally
    settled at an average of 18.81 ± 4.57 mmHg (range: 10.1–38.8 mmHg) at the respective
    time points of 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after surgery. The preoperative ECD was recorded
    as being approximately 3004 ± 295 cell/mm2, which exhibited a marginal decreased
    of 1.17% postoperatively, resulting in an average ECD value of 2969 ± 303 cell/mm2
    one week after surgery (P = 0.12). Similarly, the preoperative CV was determined
    as 31.10 ± 3.78%, and it experienced a slight reduction with an average CV value
    of 30.74 ± 3.77% at week after surgery (P = 0.21). And, the preoperative SD was
    reported as 104.76 ± 17.26, and it remained virtually unchanged with an average
    SD value of 104.85 ± 18.75 at one week after surgery (P = 0.95). The preoperative
    HEX was calculated as 55.38 ± 8.94%, and it remained its stability with an average
    HEX value of 55.45 ± 8.73% one week after surgery (P = 0.92). Conclusion The utilization
    of I/A led to a slight decrease in postoperative ECD when compared to conventional
    surgical techniques. Nevertheless, the reduction in ECD remained within acceptable
    limits, taking into accout the avervantaged it offered, such as stabilization
    of the anterior chamber and decreased occurrence of viscoelastic residue after
    surgery. It is challenging to anticipate the long-term safety of corneal endothelial
    cells based on current short-term studies. However, this study provides a valuable
    reference indicating that neither anterior chamber irrigation nor I/A aspiration
    have an adverse impact on the safety of corneal endothelial cells in the short
    term. Further research is imperative to enhance our understanding of their effects

    2022 Visual outcomes of Visian ICL implantation for high myopia in patients with
    shallow anterior chamber depth Article Open access 29 May 2019 Introduction The
    implantable collamer lens (ICL) by STAAR Surgical has been widely recognized as
    an efficient and safe treatment for individuals suffering from ametropia since
    its approval in China in 2014. The ICL with a central hole (V4c ICL) is currently
    the most commonly used in clinical practice, as its central hole can help to form
    a passage of aqueous humor circulation between the anterior and posterior chambers
    without performing an additional peripheral iridotomy [1, 2]. The brief procedures
    of V4c ICL implantation are as follows: Pupils were dilated 1 h before surgery.
    After topical anesthesia, a 2.75-mm or 3-mm superior clear corneal main incision
    was created. The ICL was inserted through the main incision with the use of an
    injector cartridge (STAAR Surgical, Switzerland). Then, the anterior chamber was
    filled with viscoelastic agent. The ICL was placed in the posterior chamber by
    gently tucking the footplates beneath the iris. Finally, irrigation and aspiration
    (I/A) were used to remove viscoelastic agent from the anterior chamber instead
    of using balanced salt solution (BSS) to wash it away and the perfusion pressure
    of I/A was between 50 and 60 mmHg [3]. After a lot of clinical practice, the use
    of I/A has been shown to be effective in maintaining anterior chamber stability,
    reducing the incidence of postoperative high intraocular pressure, and reducing
    postoperative fundus complications. However, there have been no previous studies
    on the effects of I/A on corneal endothelial cells in ICL implantation. The present
    study investigates the effect of I/A on corneal endothelial cell density (ECD)
    in patients undergoing V4c ICL implantation for myopia correction. Patients and
    methods The study complies with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and
    was approved by Biomedical Ethics Sub-Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan
    University. The requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective
    study design. A total of 344 eyes of 172 patients who underwent V4c ICL implantation
    were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent routine ophthalmic examinations
    at the Refractive Surgery Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University
    and met the surgical requirements for ICL V4c (STAAR Surgical Company, Monrovia,
    CA, USA) implantation. V4c ICL implantation procedures were performed by an experienced
    surgeon (D.Y.P). The patient''s intraocular pressure was monitored at 1 h, 2 h,
    and 3 h after surgery, and topical anti-inflammatory and infection prevention
    regimens were prescribed, including 0.3% tobramycin and 0.1% dexamethasone ophthalmic
    suspension (Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Eye Drops, s.a. ALCON-COUVREUR n.v.;
    four times per day and cut back once a week for 4 weeks), and bromfenac sodium
    hydrate ophthalmic solution (Senju Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan; two times
    per day for 4 weeks). Figure 1 shows a detailed step-by-step diagram of the surgical
    procedures. Fig. 1 Detailed step-by-step diagram of the surgical procedures using

    size image Corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), coefficient of variation in
    cell size (CV), standard deviation of cell area (SD), and percentage of hexagonal
    cells (HEX) were assessed using a non-contact specular microscope (SP-1P; Topcon,
    Tokyo, Japan) at one week after surgery. IOP was measured using a non-contact
    tonometer (NCT; Canon, Japan). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed
    using GraphPad Prism V9.0 software. To determine the within-subject correlation,
    paired T test was used to detect the difference of ECD, CV, SD, and HEX before
    and after operation. A P value of less than 0.05 means that the difference is
    statistically significant. Results A total of 172 participants (344 eyes) were
    investigated, consisting of 36 males (72 eyes) and 136 females (272 eyes). The
    mean age was 27.84 ± 4.57 y (range: 20–38 y), and the mean preoperative spherical
    equivalent (SE) was − 8.81 ± 3.66 D (range: − 3.25 to − 18.00 D). IOP was 16.50 ± 3.42
    mmHg (range: 11.5–22.3 mmHg) before surgery and 21.25 ± 5.61 mmHg (range: 9.5–34.8
    mmHg), 19.85 ± 5.18 mmHg (range: 11.4–36.2 mmHg) and 18.81 ± 4.57 mmHg (range:
    10.1–38.8 mmHg) at 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after surgery, respectively. One hour after
    surgery, the IOP in 193 eyes was less than 21 mmHg, and 14 eyes had IOP more than
    30 mmHg (maximum 34.8 mmHg). At 2 h postoperatively, IOP in 233 eyes was less
    than 21 mmHg and 9 eyes had IOP more than 30 mmHg (maximum 36.2 mmHg). At 3 h
    after surgery, the IOP in 255 eyes was less than 21 mmHg, and five eyes had IOP
    more than 30 mmHg (maximum 38.8 mmHg). The patients with IOP exceeding 30 mmHg
    did not undergo the corneal edema or any extra treatments in 3 h postoperatively,
    but their IOP dropped to less than 21 mmHg at 4 h after surgery. The characteristics
    of non-contact specular microscope of all the enrolled eyes before as well as
    1 week after surgery are shown in Table 1. The postoperative ECD and CV decreased
    by 1.17% and 1.14%, respectively, compared to the preoperative level. Meanwhile,
    the postoperative SD and HEX increased by 0.12% and 0.08%, respectively, compared
    to the preoperative level. The differences in all parameters were not statistically
    significant (Fig. 2). Table 1 Outcomes of non-contact specular microscope preoperation

    Full size image Discussion The V4c ICL is widely used in clinical practice in
    China for safe and effective correction of myopia [4]. The V4c ICL features a
    central hole that allows for the circulation of aqueous humor between the anterior
    and posterior chambers, eliminating the need for preoperative laser iridotomy
    or intraoperative iridectomy. At present, the surgical procedure of ICL implantation
    has changed from the conventional two-step viscoelastic agent technique to the
    one-step viscoelastic agent technique, the incision size has been reduced from
    the original 3.00 mm to 2.75 mm, and the incision has been changed from the temporal
    side of the cornea to the superior of the cornea. These improvements in procedures
    had been proved to reduce some postoperative complications and improve postoperative
    visual quality of patient [3, 5]. Viscoelastic agents play a crucial role in ICL
    implantation by maintaining anterior chamber stability and protecting corneal
    endothelial cells. In the conventional technique, viscoelastic agents are typically
    washed away with balanced salt solution (BSS). Due to the possible occurrence
    of iris prolapse during operation and the different volume of the viscoelastic
    agent removed from the corneal incision each time, it is easy to cause anterior
    chamber instability. Further causes intraoperative TICL rotation, and increases
    the risk of intraoperative and postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage and retinal
    detachment [6]. Additionally, the use of BSS may result in viscoelastic residue,
    a common factor contributing to elevated intraocular pressure during the early
    postoperative period [7]. I/A has been widely used in cataract surgery with remarkable
    safety measurement, which can effectively stabilize the anterior chamber and maximize
    the extraction of viscoelastic agent [8, 9]. It has been reported that the rate
    of ECD loss in phacoemulsification with I/A and viscoelastic agents is 5.5% one
    week after surgery [10]. On this basis, we applied this technique in ICL implantation
    to address issue such as anterior chamber instability and postoperative viscoelastic
    residue caused by BSS replacement of viscoelastic agent. Consequently, our observed
    ECD loss was only 1.17% one week after surgery, significantly lower compared to
    that seen in PHACO procedures. It has been reported that patients who used BSS
    to wash away viscoelastic agents in ICL implantation had a slight decrease in
    ECD postoperatively compared with that before surgery, but the difference was
    not statistically significant [3, 11]. In the study by Zhou XT [3], 4% of the
    eyes whose viscoelastic agent was washed away by BSS during ICL implantation had
    intraocular pressure exceeding 30 mmHg 3 h after surgery, which was consistent
    with our study. In their study, this part of eyes underwent corneal paracentesis
    treatment, but the IOP was still higher in 2% of eyes. However, the IOP dropped
    to the normal range 4 h after surgery without any treatment in our study. Some
    surgeons may not need to use viscoelastic agent when implanting ICL. Although
    this method is more convenient, and it has been reported that it has no statistically
    significant effect on the ECD of patients [12], it has high technical requirements
    for surgical operators. Compared with the implantation method using viscoelastic
    agent, relatively unskilled operators are more prone to problems such as such
    as ICL implantation difficulties and intraoperative damage to corneal endothelium
    and lens compared with the implant method using viscoelastic agents, so it''s
    not suitable for people who are new to the procedure. But in the long term, this
    is a very promising surgical procedure. Although the use of I/A in ICL implantation
    resulted in an overall decrease in ECD after surgery, the reduction was only 1.17%,
    which was not statistically significant. Since our measurement time point was
    one week after surgery, the effect of ICL central hole on corneal endothelium
    was relatively small. It is hypothesized that the reason for the decrease of ECD
    in patients caused by I/A may be the effect of water column generated during perfusion
    on corneal endothelium cells. It was reported that the minimum critical ECD required
    to maintain the pumping function of the endothelium is 400–500 cells/mm2. ECD
    below the critical value can result in decreased corneal transparency, development
    of corneal edema, and reduced visual acuity [13]. In addition, there were no statistically
    significant differences in CV, SD and HEX preoperatively compared with those before,
    indicating that the postoperative morphology of corneal endothelial cells in patients
    was not affected by surgery. Compared with the benefits the use of I/A in ICL
    implantation, such as reducing viscoelastic residue, stabilizing the anterior
    chamber, avoiding rotation of TICL intraoperatively, and reducing retinochoroidal
    complications, the reduction in ECD(1.17%) caused by it was within a clinically
    acceptable loss range. Moreover, I/A is also very helpful for beginners of ICL
    surgery. The SP-1P device is is capable of evaluating not only the central area
    of the cornea but also the relative peripheral area of the cornea through 17 fixation
    targets, resulting in a comprehensive examination of the corneal endothelium and
    avoiding the influence caused by the limited measurement range. However, our research
    still has limitations. The reason for conducting an examination one week after
    surgery is that it is easier to detect the impact of the surgical procedure itself
    in the early postoperative period. Early examination is more concerned with surgical
    safety, while late examination is more aimed at detecting the effectiveness and
    stability of the surgery. Based on the research purpose, the observation time
    is relatively early, but it is also inevitable to experience data fluctuations
    due to the incomplete stability of the anterior chamber. Conclusion In conclusion,
    the use of I/A during ICL implantation resulted in a 1.17% decrease in postoperative
    ECD compared to the preoperative levels, but it had no effect on the morphology
    of corneal endothelial cells in patients. The limitations of our study should
    be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Further research with
    longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes is needed to fully understand
    the effects of I/A on corneal endothelium in ICL implantation. Data availability

    are widely used for protected cultivation because of their multiple advantages
    over soil cultivation1,2,3,4. Over the last decade, substrate culture has expanded
    rapidly in China5,6. Irrigation management of substrate cultures is of great importance
    because irrigation is the only source of water required by crops and the water-holding
    capacity of the substrate is very low3,7,8. In practice, most irrigation is managed
    based on the experiences of growers and advisors. Timer-based methods are commonly
    used in the irrigation management of substrate cultures in solar greenhouses in
    China. This can easily lead to plants suffering from water stress caused by inadequate
    irrigation, or roots suffering from hypoxia due to excessive irrigation, adversely
    affecting plant growth and fruit production2,3,9. Noncirculating systems are more
    commonly used for irrigation in coconut coir cultures because of the difficulty
    in filtration and disinfection of the discharge liquid10. Excessive irrigation
    also results in the wastage of water and fertilizer and causes environmental pollution,
    which increases the pressure on water scarcity and environmental protection. Therefore,
    precise irrigation scheduling for coconut coir cultivation in solar greenhouses
    is urgently required owing to its potential to promote yield, decrease water used
    for irrigation, and improve water-use efficiency. Preparing an irrigation schedule
    involves determining when (irrigation frequency) and how much to irrigate (irrigation
    amount)11,12. Irrigation frequency is related to the climate and crop development
    stage. The irrigation amount includes the water required to maintain maximum rates
    of crop transpiration without water stress and an additional amount to manage
    substrate salinity and deal with application uniformity7,12. However, existing
    studies on the effects of irrigation frequency on crop production are inconclusive11.
    The measurements of substrates, atmospheric variables, and plants closely related
    to crop transpiration can directly help make decisions or provide information
    for calculating the irrigation frequency and amount13. In recent years, the most
    commonly researched approaches for irrigation include 1) the use of soil/substrate
    moisture sensors4,14,15, 2) the estimation of crop water requirements based on
    climatic data2,8,16, and 3) the use of weighing lysimeters17,18,19 or plant sensors10.
    Soil moisture sensors can be read with continuous automatic data collection to
    obtain detailed information on the dynamics of water use by crops, which can be
    used to manage irrigation9,20,21. The simplest method is to compare the values
    of the soil moisture sensor with the selected lower and upper limits of soil moisture
    to initiate and stop irrigation9,12.The appliance of dielectric sensors in substrate
    has been documented by many research7,12,22,23,24. Capacitive or frequency-domain
    reflectance (FDR)-based moisture sensors have the advantages of low cost, good
    reliability, and easy maintenance, and are widely used in research applications
    and commercial cultivation irrigation management7,9,25. Moreover, the approaches
    for irrigation using climatic data are based on energy balance and bring water
    supply more closely match to crop transpiration. The accumulated radiation method,
    which initiates irrigation based on measurements of the integral of solar radiation
    over the canopy, is a relatively easy approach based on climatic data2,23.The
    method is commonly used in greenhouses in the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey and
    in substrate cultivation of glass greenhouse in China2,7,12,26.The crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) estimated from ETc = ETo \\(\\times\\) Kc, where ETo is the reference crop
    evapotranspiration estimated by the Penman-Monteith method and Kc is the crop
    coefficient, is important to correctly quantify crop irrigation requirements27.Many
    commercial weather stations provide precise and real-time environmental data on
    a scale of hours or even minutes. These data are consistent with the requirements
    for hourly ETo calculation12,28.The irrigation scheduling by estimating ETc using
    the hourly PM-ETo equation, which provides numerous small irrigations each day,
    is a more scientific method based on climate parameters for substrate culture.
    However,The response of plant transpiration rate to solar radiation may vary with
    variations in crop species, developmental stages, and the environment29,30,31.The
    accumulated radiation threshold for triggering irrigation or irrigation amount
    should be adjusted for specific application scenarios2,10,26.The three constant
    Kc values of the standard FAO method, each for a fixed developmental stage, are
    unsuitable for greenhouse-grown crops because of variability in crop training
    systems and management practices, planting dates, length of the cropping cycle,
    plant density, and cultivars7,12,15,32. Using the three constant Kc values of
    the standard FAO method to estimate ETc may impact the accuracy of irrigation
    amount. Therefore, to enhance irrigation management for coconut coir cultivation
    in solar greenhouses, it is necessary to improve irrigation schedules. The integration
    of meteorological parameters and soil moisture sensors allows for the estimation
    of irrigation levels using energy balance in combination with site-specific adaptive
    responses to sensors15,33.In substrate cultivation, the amount of irrigation and
    discharge can be easily measured manually or automatically. The ETc can be calculated
    using the water balance formula and used to divide by ETo to obtain the actual
    Kc, which can improve the accuracy of crop evapotranspiration estimation for precise
    irrigation. Therefore, we developed two irrigation schedules. One is a composite
    irrigation system that combines accumulated radiation and soil moisture sensors
    (Rn-VWC), and the other is an improved method based on estimating ETc using the
    hourly PM-ETo equation with an improved calculation of Kc values (T-ETc). Furthermore,
    the soil moisture sensor-based method (T-VWC)34, developed in our previous work,
    was used as a reference. The analysis included irrigation, evapotranspiration,
    substrate water content, growth and yield characteristics, and IWP. The goal is
    to establish a precise irrigation schedule for coconut coir cultivation in solar
    greenhouses to ensure cucumber yield and improve IWP in China. Methods Experimental
    conditions This research was carried out at the Xiaotangshan National Precision
    Agriculture Experiment Station in Beijing, China (40\\(^{\\circ }\\)10’43” N,
    116\\(^{\\circ }\\)26’39” E) from March 15 to June 19, 2017. The experimental
    greenhouse was 28 m long and 7.5 m wide, with a wall made of brick-concrete and
    brackets constructed with welded galvanized steel pipes and covered with a transparent
    plastic film. To avoid excessive temperatures within the structure, the greenhouse
    was screened with a 50% shading net from 10:00 to 15:00 on sunny days from May
    16 to June 19. The H-type substrate cultivation system was 500 cm long, 24 cm
    wide, and 40 cm high and was equipped with a cultivation tank with a hole for
    drainage at the end (Fig. 1(5)). A bucket was connected to the hold via a plastic
    hose to collect the discharged water. Coconut coir slabs [ 100 cm (length) \\(\\times\\)
    20 cm (wide) \\(\\times\\) 8 cm (height)] were composed of 70% coconut chunks
    (10–20 mm) and 30% coconut bran (0-6 mm) with EC \\(< 1.00\\) mS cm\\(^{-1}\\)
    and pH 5.8–6.8. The bulk density, porosity air-water ratio, and organic matter
    of the coconut coir slab were 0.14 g cm\\(^{-3}\\), 87.89%, 0.26, and 86.4%, respectively.
    Coconut coir slabs were wrapped with a polyethylene (PE) film on six sides to
    avoid the evaporation of substrate water. Irrigation was controlled using an automatic
    fertigation applicator developed by the Intelligent Equipment Research Center
    of the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences34. Yamazaki cucumber
    nutrient solution formula was used in this study and was applied using a drip
    irrigation system with in-line emitters of 2 L h\\(^{-1}\\) discharge. The emitter
    distance was 25 cm and was associated with a single row of plants. The cucumber
    variety used in the experiment was “Zhongnong 26”, and cucumbers were transplanted
    on March 15 and harvested from April 19 to June 19. Cucumbers were arranged in
    two rows for each cultivation system, and 10 plants were planted in each row at
    a planting density of 3 plants m\\(^{-2}\\). Experimental design Two irrigation
    schedules were developed: a complex irrigation schedule combining accumulated
    radiation and soil moisture sensors (Rn-VWC) and another irrigation schedule based
    on estimating ETc by the hourly PM-ETo equation with an improved calculation of
    Kc values (T-ETc). The soil moisture sensor-based method (T-VWC)34, which was
    developed in our previous research and significantly reduces irrigation amount
    and improves IWP compared with Timer-based scheduling, was used as a reference.
    In the T-VWC treatment, irrigation frequency and amount were determined hourly
    from 7:00 to 18:00. Irrigation was triggered when the value recorded by the soil
    moisture sensor was lower than the maximum substrate water content (\\(VWC_{max}\\),
    m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)). The amount of irrigation was determined by the substrate
    water content read by the sensor (VWC, m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)).In Rn-VWC treatment,
    every irrigation event was initiated when the accumulative radiation reached 0.8
    MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), and the calculation of irrigation amount was consistent with
    T-VWC. The irrigation amount of the T-ETc treatment was dependent on the hourly
    ETc (\\(ETc_{h}\\)) calculated by multiplying Kc by the hourly ETo (\\(ETo_{h}\\)),
    where \\(ETo_{h}\\) was estimated using the standardized reference evapotranspiration
    equation (ASCE-PM)28, and Kc was obtained from the daily actual evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{d}\\)) and daily ETo (\\(ETo_{d}\\)) of the previous day. Irrigation was
    triggered when \\(ETc_{h}\\) reached or exceeded 0.4 mm to avoid a small amount
    for a single irrigation; otherwise, irrigation was not performed temporarily,
    and this \\(ETc_{h}\\) was accumulated into the next time. Furthermore, the coefficient
    k was incorporated to aid in determining the irrigation amount to ensure proper
    drainage for managing substrate salinity. The value of k was determined based
    on the variance between the electrical conductivity (EC) of irrigation and drainage.2,35,36.
    Descriptions of the three irrigation schedules were presented in Table 1. \\(M_1\\)
    in Table 1 was the calculated irrigation amount used for the actual irrigation
    amount (Ir) of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments,and could be described as follows:
    $$\\begin{aligned} M_1 = 0.001 (VWC_{max} - VWC) V p/\\eta \\end{aligned}$$ (1)
    where \\(VWC_{max}\\) is 0.507 (m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)), V is the volume of
    the substrate to be irrigated (m\\(^{3}\\)), p is the wetting ratio of the substrate,
    \\(\\eta\\) is the irrigation efficiency.In substrate cultivation, the small volume
    of the substrate is distributed by the root system of the crop, requiring complete
    wetting through irrigation. Therefore, p in this study was 100%. The nutrient
    solution was delivered to the substrate without any loss, \\(\\eta\\) was set
    at 1.0. s in Table 1 was the area of the cultivation plot (m\\(^{2}\\)). The \\(ETc_{h}\\)
    was determined using Eq. (2). $$\\begin{aligned} ETc_{h}=K_c ETo_{h} \\end{aligned}$$
    (2) where \\(K_c\\) can be obtained with an improved calculation as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    K_c=ET_{d}/ETo_{d} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) The ET was the actual evapotranspiration
    calculated by the water balance method37. The change in substrate water content
    was too small to be neglected compared to the evapotranspiration and runoff did
    not occur. Therefore, The ET and \\(ET_{d}\\) in Ep.3 were determined using Eqs.
    (4) and (5),respectively. $$\\begin{aligned} ET=(Ir-D)/s \\end{aligned}$$ (4)
    where s is the area of the cultivation plot (m\\(^{2}\\)), Ir is the amount of
    irrigation (L), and D is the amount of discharge (L). $$\\begin{aligned} ET_{d}=(Ir_{d}-D_d)/s
    \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where \\(Ir_d\\) is the daily amount of irrigation (L), and
    \\(D_d\\) is the daily amount of discharge (L). Because coconut coir slabs were
    wrapped with PE film on six sides to avoid the evaporation of substrate water,
    it was considered that the actual evapotranspiration (ET) was equal to the transpiration
    of cucumber plants in this study. The three irrigation schedules were programmed
    and imported into the operating system of the automatic fertigation system and
    started at the first cucumber fruit site (April 14), and The Timer-based method
    (0.02 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) h\\(^{-1}\\)) was applied before. The treatments were
    arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates per treatment.
    One H-type cultivation system was a replicate equipped with a branch pipe connected
    to the main pipe through an electric valve and a high-precision flowmeter, which
    was used to ensure independent irrigation of each cultivation system. At the center
    of each cultivation system, an EC-5 sensor (METER Group, Inc., USA) was installed
    between the two plants in the coconut coir slabs to measure the substrate water
    content. The EC of the irrigation and discharge nutrient solutions were measured
    using electrical conductivity (EC) sensors. The amounts of irrigation and discharge
    were measured using high-precision flow meters and water lever sensors installed
    in the discharge collection bucket, respectively. Irrigation frequency was obtained
    by recording the opening and closing of the electric valves. All the electric
    valves, high-precision flow meters, and sensors were connected to an automatic
    fertigation system. The schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown
    in Fig. 1. The VWC, EC, and water level data from the sensors were collected every
    5 s. Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental set-up: (1) ressure-regulated

    The solar radiation, temperature, and relative humidity were measured every 5

    Table 1 Treatments for the three irrigation schedules. Full size table The leaf
    was marked at the beginning of its expansion, and its area was calculated by measuring
    the length and width38. Stem diameter 1 cm below the marked leaf was measured
    with a vernier caliper. The fruits were harvested when they reached normal size.
    The yield and number of cucumbers from each cultivation system were determined
    at the beginning (April 19 to April 30), middle (May 1 to June 5) and end (June
    6 to June 19) of the harvest, and the mean fruit weight and total yield were calculated.
    The soluble protein, soluble sugar, vitamin C, and NO\\(_3^{-}\\)-N contents of
    five fruits per replicate were measured at mid-harvest to compare fruit quality39.
    Drainage rate (DR) and IWP (fresh weight/irrigation amount) were also calculated
    with Eqs. (6) and (7),(respectively. $$\\begin{aligned} DR= & {} D/Ir \\end{aligned}$$
    (6) $$\\begin{aligned} IWP=Y/I \\end{aligned}$$ (7) where Y is total yield (t

    Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted by one-way analysis of
    variance (ANOVA), using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).The differences
    among mean values were established by Duncan’s multiple range test at P \\(< 0.05\\).
    Results and analysis Irrigation, evapotranspiration, and drainage at harvest of
    cucumber The dates related to the daily irrigation and evapotranspiration, and
    drainage of the three irrigation schedules during harvest were listed in Table
    2.The daily number of irrigation events varied according to irrigation scheduling,
    and the highest and lowest were recorded at 14 and 5 times at the beginning and
    end of harvest, respectively, for the Rn-VWC treatment.The daily number of irrigation
    under the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments were 12 times and 9-10 times. The daily amount
    of irrigation (\\(Ir_{d}\\)) was recorded as 1.70–2.00 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), 0.85–2.03
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) in the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and
    T-ETc treatments, respectively. Similar to the irrigation events, the highest
    and lowest \\(Ir_{d}\\) were recorded at the beginning and end of the harvest,
    respectively, in the Rn-VWC treatment, and the difference between the three stages
    of the harvest was small in the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments. At the beginning and
    middle of harvest, \\(Ir_{d}\\) in the T-ETc treatment was lower than that in
    the other treatments. Table 2 The effect of irrigation scheduling on the daily
    number and amount of irrigation together with evapotranspiration and drainage
    rate at the beginning, middle and end of harvest. Full size table Because irrigation
    is the only source of water for cucumber plants, the daily evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{d}\\)) were very similar to the irrigation. The maximum and minimum \\(ET_{d}\\)
    were 4.66 and 1.91 mm, at the beginning and end of the harvest in Rn-VWC treatment,
    respectively. Moreover, the T-ETc treatment had the lowest \\(ET_{d}\\) at the
    beginning and middle of harvest, with figures for 2.17 and 2.94 mm, respectively,
    and at the end of harvest was lower than that in the T-VWC treatment. The daily
    drainage (\\(D_d\\)) under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc treatments during the
    experiment ranged from 0.34-0.43 L plant\\(^{-1}\\)),0.18-0.40 L plant\\(^{-1}\\)),0.26-0.50
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\)), respectively.Thus,the drainage rate (DR) was within an appropriate
    range and was calculated as 17.49–33.48%, 19.57–24.47%, and 19.95–35.83%, respectively.
    The differences in DR among the different treatments at the beginning and end
    of harvest were the smallest and the largest, respectively. Irrigation, evapotranspiration,
    and substrate water content under different weather conditions The solar radiation,
    air temperature, and relative humidity Of different weather conditions The solar
    radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity inside the greenhouse on April
    26 (sunny), May 3 (cloudy), and May 24 (sunny and shading screens used) are plotted
    in Fig. 2. The daily solar radiation in these three days was 15.45 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\),
    3.98 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), and 7.56 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), respectively, and the mean air
    temperature and relative humidity were 20.38 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C, 22.08 \\(^{\\circ
    }\\) C, and 23.40 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C and 52.51%, 46.10%, and 54.16%, respectively.
    The maximum values of solar radiation and air temperature on April 26 and May
    24 reached 691 J m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) and 37.12 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C and 322
    J m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) and 34.02 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C, respectively, indicating
    that the use of shading screens on May 24 effectively reduced the solar radiation
    inside the green-house and kept the maximum air temperature within 35 \\(^{\\circ

    and shading screens used). Irrigation and evapotranspiration under different weather
    conditions The irrigation frequency of T-VWC and T-ETc treatments was determined
    using Timer (7:00–18:00) and had the auxiliary condition of “ETc \\(\\ge\\) 0.4
    mm for starting irrigation” under the T-ETc treatment. Figure 3 shown that the
    irrigation events in the T-ETc treatment were 8, 4, and 11 times, which were less
    than that in the T-VWC treatment (12 times). For the Rn-VWC treatment based on
    accumulated radiation to determine the irrigation frequency, the irrigation period
    was shortened with an increase in solar radiation. On April 26 (sunny), the irrigation
    frequency from 10:00 to 15:00 was significantly higher than that during other
    periods, and had the maximum number of irrigation events with 15 times; the minimum
    number of irrigation events was four times, recorded on May 3 (cloudy). Owing
    to the amount of irrigation (Ir) based on the soil moisture sensor, the T-VWC
    and Rn-VWC treatments had the largest amount for the first daily irrigation event
    (Fig. 3). This might be because the root system absorbed water from the substrate
    for plant transpiration and metabolism, and no irrigation occurred at night, which
    led to a decrease in substrate water content. The fluctuations in the amounts
    between other irrigation events were small. The Ir of the T-ETc treatment was
    0.10 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) on April 26 and May 3, and showed a single peak curve
    similar to radiation and temperature on May 24, with a maximum value of 0.20 L
    plant\\(^{-1}\\). The ET values for the three irrigation schedules were shown
    in Fig. 3. Daily variations in ET were analyzed. The ET of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC
    treatments were higher in the first irrigation cycle, which might be related to
    a higher amount of irrigation. The ET in the T-VWC treatment gradually decreased
    in the afternoon, which differed from the variation in irrigation amount. However,
    the daily variation of ET was consistent with that of irrigation amount in the
    T-ETc treatment. Additionally, both the ET of the T-VWC treatment on May 3 (cloudy)
    and the ET of the T-ETc treatment on May 24 (sunny with shading screens used)
    were significantly lower than their irrigation amount, resulting in a high DR
    (40.75% and 40.88%, respectively). The Rn-VWC treatment had a similar effect on
    two sunny days. This suggests that the T-VWC treatment on cloudy day, the Rn-VWC
    treatment on sunny day, and the T-ETc treatment on sunny day with shading screens
    used were over-irrigated. Figure 3 Irrigation and discharge amount together with

    different weather conditions The changes in substrate water content under different
    irrigation schedules were shown in Fig. 4. The substrate water content in the
    T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments were always lower than the maximum substrate water
    content during the experiment. Because the low indoor light radiation on May 3
    and 24 increased the irrigation interval, and the strong indoor light radiation
    on April 26 led to frequent irrigation, the substrate water content of the Rn-VWC
    treatment had the largest fluctuation. The substrate water content of the T-ETc
    treatment was relatively stable, which might be because the irrigation supply
    tended to synchronize with evapotranspiration. In addition, there was a significant
    increase in the substrate moisture content of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments
    on April 26 and the T-ETc treatment on May 24, which might be due to excessive
    irrigation. Figure 4 The substrate water content diurnal curves under different

    on plant growth of cucumber As shown in Fig. 5, the plant height and the number
    of leaves increased continuously from April 17 to June 1. The area of the marked
    leaves and stem diameter below the marked leaf increased rapidly at the beginning
    of the measurement period, after April 31 it increased slowly. The height, number
    of leaves, leaf area, and stem diameter of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments were
    higher than those of the T-ETc treatment, and the differences of the height and
    the number of leaves after April 31 and the leaf area after April 25 were more
    obvious. But there was no difference between the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments.

    3 listed the cucumber number, mean weight, and yield of the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and

    except that the mean weight of fruit in the T-ETc treatment at the last fruit
    stage was significantly higher than that in the Rn-VWC treatment (P \\(< 0.05\\)).
    Because the number, mean weight, and yield in the Rn-VWC treatment were the lowest
    at all harvest stages, its total yield (58.98 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) was lower than
    that of the T-VWC (66.77 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) and T-ETc (64.54 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) treatments
    (Table 3). The T-VWC treatment had the highest total yield but the difference

    Full size table Total irrigation amount and irrigation water productivity The
    Total irrigation amount (I) determined for the treatments with different irrigation
    schedules were summarized in Fig. 6 (a). The I under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc
    treatments were 3,901.92 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\), 2897.15 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\),
    and 2573.88 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\), respectively. The T-VWC and T-ETc treatment
    had the highest and the lowest values. Compared with the T-VWC treatment, I for
    the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments significantly decreased by 25.75% and 34.04%,
    respectively, and there was significant difference between the T-VWC and T-ETc
    treatments (P \\(<0.05\\)). As shown in Fig. 6b, the irrigation water productivity
    (IWP) under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc treatments were 17.37 kg m−3, 20.52 kg
    m−3, 25.07 kg m−3, respectively. Compared with the T-VWC treatment, the IWP under
    the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments increased by 18.13% and 44.33%, respectively.
    The T-ETc treatment had the highest IWP. Moreover, there was a significant difference
    between T-ETc treatment and T-VWC treatment (P \\(< 0.05\\)). This was linked
    to the calculation of irrigation amount based on the estimation of ETc in the
    T-ETc treatment, which resulted in no loss of yield, but a significant decrease
    in irrigation and evapotranspiration. Figure 6 Total irrigation amount and irrigation

    scheduling on irrigation Scientific irrigation scheduling is needed to synchronize
    the supply with the real water requirements of substrate-cultivated crops and
    to maintain an appropriate substrate water content and DR to protect the crop
    from water and salt stress. The DR was generally 15–30% and it could increase
    to 30–35% if necessary2,36. In addition, owing to the limited volume and low water
    retention of the substrate, irrigation needed to be small and frequent to ensure
    good plant growth. The results of this study shown that the daily irrigation frequency
    under the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments was 12 times and 9–10 times, the Ir was 1.70–2.00
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\) and 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and the DR was 17.49–33.48%
    and 19.95–35.83%, respectively. The irrigation frequency under the Rn-VWC treatment
    decreased with the weakening of solar radiation while increased with the strengthening
    of solar radiation in the greenhouse (Fig. 3). This led to a high amount of irrigation
    at the beginning of the harvest period (Table 2), a decrease in irrigation at
    the middle and end of the harvest period (Table 2) and a large fluctuation in
    the water content of the substrate (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the results
    of Wei et al26. Compared with the Rn-VWC treatment, the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments
    provided more suitable irrigation management for cucumbers in coconut coir culture.
    As the coconut coir slab is a coarse substrate with high porosity, finger flow
    is easily formed under drip irrigation, which reduces the water content of the
    substrate at a distance from the emitter or the time lag to reach the same water
    content4,24.Moreover, the soil moisture sensor represents a “point measurement”
    in space4,11,20. The placement of soil moisture sensor directly affects the efficiency
    of irrigation scheduling4. the T-VWC treatment had a higher daily irrigation amount
    (Table 2) and fluctuations in substrate water content (Fig. 4) than the T-ETc
    treatment. These might be related to the fact that the irrigation amount of the
    T-VWC treatment was based on soil moisture sensors, which were arranged in the
    middle of the adjacent emitters. The T-ETc treatment made the change in of irrigation
    amount tend to the actual transpiration of cucumber plants (Fig. 3) and then reduced
    the total irrigation amount by 34.04% compared with the T-VWC treatment (Table
    2). Therefore, the T-ETc treatment was better than the T-VWC treatment in this
    study. The T-VWC treatment based on soil moisture sensor needs to further optimizing
    the installation position of the sensor to improve irrigation efficiency. Effect
    of irrigation scheduling on evapotranspiration In general, crop transpiration
    increases with irrigation2,11,33. In this study, evapotranspiration was equal
    to the transpiration of the cucumber plants because the six sides of the coconut
    coir slabs were wrapped with PE films to avoid the evaporation of substrate water.
    The difference in \\(ET_{d}\\) among the different treatments at each harvest
    stage was consistent with that in Ir. The \\(ET_{d}\\) of the T-ETc treatment
    was the lowest at the beginning and middle of the harvest and was inferior to
    that of the T-VWC treatment at the end of the harvest (Table 2). In addition,
    the T-ETc treatment with low irrigation had the smallest number of leaves and
    leaf area, which further reduced the transpiration from cucumber plants. It is
    often assumed that the water requirements of greenhouse-grown crops are equivalent
    to those of crop evapotranspiration. This indicates that the daily variation tendency
    of irrigation amount should be consistent with evapotranspiration.12. In the three
    meteorological environments of this experiment, the ET of the T-VWC treatment
    decreased with the weakening of solar radiation in the afternoon, especially on
    cloudy days, which was different from the irrigation amount, with a very small
    variation. The daily variation of ET in the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments had the
    same tendency as that of the irrigation amount (Fig. 3). Shin et al31,33 found
    that the transpiration rate was not always proportional to the light intensity
    and was almost constant when the light intensity exceeded 200 J s\\(^{-1}\\) m\\(^{-1}\\),
    suggested that the cumulative radiation threshold used to trigger irrigation should
    be adjusted appropriately under bright light conditions to avoid over-irrigation.
    Similar results were observed for the Rn-VWC treatment. During most of the time
    from 7:00 to 18:00 on April 26 and May 24, the solar radiation in the greenhouse
    was above 200 J s\\(^{-1}\\) m\\(^{-1}\\) and the cumulative radiation threshold
    in Rn-VWC treatment was fixed, which could resulted in excessive irrigation and
    high DR (over 35%). In addition, the application of environmental control systems
    in greenhouses affects the correlation between meteorological parameters and crop
    transpiration23,31,40. After using the shading screens, the incident radiation
    and vapor pressure deficit, the response of leaf transpiration to incident radiation,
    and the transpiration rate per unit leaf area decreased significantly29,41. The
    ET of cucumber on May 24 in the T-ETc treatment was significantly lower than the
    irrigation amount (Fig. 3), which may be related to the high \\(ETc_{h}\\) estimated
    by Eq. (2) due to the use of shading system. Therefore, it is necessary to further
    investigate the response mechanisms of crop photosynthesis, transpiration, and
    other physiological activities under the application of greenhouse environmental
    control systems to provide a theoretical basis for continuing to optimize irrigation
    methods. The purpose of this study is to obtain a more precise irrigation regime
    suitable for coconut coir cultivation of cucumber in solar greenhouses. However,
    the data used for the analysis of irrigation regimes under different meteorological
    conditions in this study is limited, which needs to be improved in the future
    studies. Effect of irrigation scheduling on the yield of cucumber and IWP The
    effect of irrigation scheduling on crop yield in substrate culture depends on
    irrigation frequency and amount. A higher frequency of irrigation, which could
    maintain the stability of the substrate water content, helped improve yield2,9,11,42.
    Suyum et al.9 found that the fluctuation in substrate water content increases
    with a decrease in the threshold of substrate water content for irrigation control,
    resulting in a decline in sweet basil yield. Similar results were observed for
    the Rn-VWC treatment, with the highest fluctuation in substrate water content
    and the lowest yield. Especially at the end of harvest, the yield decreased by
    22.35–24.81%. The primary response of plants to water stress is the inhibition
    of cell expansion43, which, in turn, affects fruit size and weight. At the end
    of harvest, the mean weight of fruit in the Rn-VWC treatment was significantly
    reduced, leading to the lowest yield (Table 3). It is suggested that the large
    fluctuation in substrate water content may cause the plants to suffer from water
    stress. However, this result was inconsistent with previous studies on tomatoes3,11
    and sweet peppers44, which showed that a reduction in fruit number was the cause
    of lower yield under water stress. According to the characteristics of the crop
    water production function, the yield increases with an increase in the irrigation
    amount when water is the limiting factor; if the increase in the irrigation amount
    is greater than that in crop production, the input of water should be limited45
    . Simsek et al.46 constructed a polynomial equation using cucumber yield and irrigation
    data from two years and pointed out that excessive irrigation reduces yield. Meric
    et al.2 found that the increase in yield caused by high-frequency irrigation was
    slower than the increase in the irrigation amount. Hao et al.11 reported that
    the yield of tomatoes increased slowly to approach their plateau when the irrigation
    amount reached 70% and 90% of cumulative evaporation. The total irrigation amount
    in the T-VWC treatment was significantly higher than that in the T-ETc treatment,
    while the total yield was almost the same. This indicated that the greater amount
    of irrigation in the T-VWC treatment did not contribute to the yield. This finding
    was consistent with those of above-mentioned studies. Moreover, the plant height,
    stem diameter, leaf number, and leaf area under the T-VWC treatment were higher
    than those under the T-ETc treatment. It was suggested that the cucumbers under
    the T-VWC treatment were biased towards nutrient growth. Due to the pursuit of
    cucumber yield, T-VWC treatment was considered to provide excessive irrigation,
    leading to waste of water and fertilizer resources. IWP is the ratio of yield
    to irrigation amount and is an important criterion for evaluating production systems41,47.
    In general, IWP increased with the decrease of irrigation amount and the increase
    of yield. Recep et al.47 found that the treatment with the least amount of irrigation
    resulted in the highest IWP of cucumbers grown in a solar green-house during the
    springsummer season. In the present study, the decrease in the yield under the
    Rn-VWC treatment was less than the reduction in the irrigation amount, however,
    the yield under the T-ETc treatment did not decrease with the reduction in the
    irrigation amount. Thus, the IWP under the T-ETc treatment was the highest, followed
    by that under the Rn-VWC treatment. Conclusion In this study, three irrigation
    schedules for cucumber coconut coir cultures were evaluated. The results shown
    that the daily irrigation frequency, irrigation amount, and discharge rate under
    the T-ETc treatment were 9–10 times, 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and 19.95–35.83%,
    respectively, and the irrigation amount was consistent with the change in ET.
    Compared to the other two treatments, the total irrigation amount in the T-ETc
    treatment was the lowest, the cucumber yield was not affected, and IWP was the
    highest. The T-ETc treatment synchronized irrigation with the transpiration of
    cucumber plants and saved a substantially larger amount of water and fertilizer.
    Thus, the method based on estimating ETc using the hourly PM–ETo equation with
    an improved calculation of Kc values (T-ETc) was a more precise irrigation management
    method for cucumbers in coconut coir culture. Data availability The data used

    Article Open access 25 May 2022 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals
    were established by the United Nations in 2015. The set of goals include 17 objectives
    that span various domains, including economic, social, and environmental dimensions.
    Consequently, the interplay between these goals can give rise to conflicts and
    intricacies. As an illustration, it advocates for the safeguarding of the environment
    and ecosystems, concurrently emphasizing the need for job creation, enhanced food
    production, and poverty elimination. The design of the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) demonstrates a shared global commitment to pursuing sustainable development,
    despite the numerous complexities and obstacles that exist in the real world.
    As a result, an increasing number of academics and policymakers have directed
    their attention towards achieving a harmonious equilibrium within various domains
    and harnessing the potential synergies among diverse sustainable development objectives.
    The research contents of this study are situated within the context of Sustainable
    Development Goal 6 (SDG6) and Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), and the focus
    lies on the strategies to improve water usage efficiency in agricultural practices
    and the elimination of energy poverty are crucial components in achieving SDG
    6 and SDG 7. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to examine the
    correlation between agricultural water usage efficiency and energy poverty, with
    the aim of identifying various ways to align these two Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). In the agricultural sector and rural areas, these two goals are
    inextricably linked, as there is a strong connection between energy and irrigation1,2,3,4,5,6.
    Agriculture is a crucial economic sector in developing nations, but it must contend
    with inefficient water usage and diminishing water resources. Concerns have been
    voiced concerning the worldwide scarcity and overexploitation of freshwater resources
    as a result of economic expansion and rising demand for food, feed, and fuel.
    Irrigated agriculture consumes around 70 percent of the world''s water resources7.
    As industrialization and urbanization continue, there is growing concern about
    the impact on agricultural water use as water is diverted to other sectors8. Simultaneously,
    demand for food production has been increasing and is projected to rise by around
    60 percent by 20507. Furthermore, climate change is expected to worsen the future
    imbalance between supply and demand for water, as well as increase supply variability9.
    Droughts induced by climate change demand more irrigation and more water to ameliorate,
    highlighting the significance of improving agricultural water efficiency (AWE).
    Energy consumption analyses of different agricultural activities demonstrate that
    irrigation requires far more energy than other agricultural activities10,11. Although
    a number of studies have analyzed the energy efficiency of agricultural production,
    the essence is to explore the ability of energy to be converted into agricultural
    output, and these studies do not take into account the fact that farmers often
    have various troubles with energy use in reality. Hence, it is imperative to investigate
    the influence of a region’s degree of energy development on agriculture and irrigation.
    This research perspective diverges from current studies that primarily focus on
    analyzing direct energy inputs within the agricultural sector. As the world’s
    largest developing country, China provides a unique sample for studying the impact
    of energy poverty on agricultural water efficiency. The following are two reasons
    for selecting China as the study sample. First, China is still continuing to strengthen
    its energy facilities and to improve its energy development. Many rural areas
    in China are still lagging behind in energy construction, and it was not until
    2020 that universal access to rural power electricity was fully achieved. If water
    facilities do not receive sufficient energy support, they are bound to fail to
    operate efficiently. Energy poverty (EP) is a comprehensive indicator that can
    effectively characterize the level of energy development in a region12. Second,
    China is not rich in water resources. China’s water availability per capita is
    about a fourth of the international average13. China must improve agricultural
    water efficiency to achieve agricultural water conservation and food security14.
    In addition, we have seen a number of reports within China of completed wells
    being unable to irrigate properly due to lack of electricity. Therefore, it is
    highly likely that the level of energy development in the region has a direct
    impact on the effectiveness of irrigation facilities, and thus on the efficiency
    of irrigation. This is one of the important practical contexts for this study
    to examine energy poverty and agricultural water efficiency. Therefore, China
    is a suitable sample for studying this element. The results of a study on China
    would be more reliable and useful. At the same time, the results would be beneficial
    to other developing countries trying to alleviate water scarcity and energy poverty.
    Materials and methods All of the data for this study came from publicly available
    sources, including the China Agriculture Yearbook, China Rural Statistical Yearbook,
    China Agricultural Machinery Industry Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook, and
    China Population and Employment Statistics Yearbook. These data sources are complied
    into the Express Professional Superior Data Platform, which integrates rich numerical
    data resources and powerful analytical forecasting system. Details about the data
    source and variables used in the statistical analyses are presented in the Table
    A1 of online supplementary material S1. The sample period begins from 2002 and
    ends to 2017 for two reasons: first, China’s farmland water development reached
    a new and relatively stable stage after the abolition of agricultural taxes in
    2002; second, China has been vigorously pursuing agricultural water price reform
    since 2017, which may have had an impact on agricultural water use efficiency.
    Therefore, choosing data between 2002 and 2017 is beneficial to avoid other factors
    that are difficult to control with, such as policy shocks from interfering with
    the study. Agricultural water efficiency calculated using the DEA model The input-oriented
    super-efficient Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is used to calculate AWE,
    which measures the ability to create a certain output with the fewest feasible
    water inputs. The input-oriented model assesses the efficacy of factor inputs
    of the evaluated decision-making units (DMU) from an input perspective. It specifically
    examines the degree to which input factors can be reduced without compromising
    output levels. Irrigation water serves as an essential input in agricultural production.
    It is crucial to ensure agricultural output while striving for optimal efficiency
    in water usage. Consequently, minimizing the amount of irrigation water employed
    results in increased agricultural water use efficiency. $${AWE}_{i,t}=\\frac{{OAWI}_{i,t}}{{AAWI}_{i,t}}$$
    (1) where \\({AWE}_{i,t}\\) denotes province i at time t in terms of agricultural
    water efficiency. \\({AAWI}_{i,t}\\) is the actual agricultural water input of
    province i at time t, \\({OAWI}_{i,t}\\) is the optimal agricultural water input
    of province i at time t. The standard form of the DEA model yields a linear programming
    approach to achieve the least amount of inputs while guaranteeing outputs under
    certain constraints as follows: $$\\begin{gathered} \\min \\left( {\\theta - \\varepsilon
    \\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{m} s_{i}^{ - } + \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j
    = 1}^{q} s_{j}^{ + } } \\right)} \\right) \\hfill \\\\ {\\text{s}}.{\\text{t}}.\\left\\{
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} { \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {k = 1} \\\\ {k \\ne j} \\\\ \\end{array} }}^{n} \\lambda_{k} x_{ik} + s_{i}^{
    - } = \\theta x_{i}\\quad i = 1,2, \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot, m} \\\\ { \\mathop \\sum
    \\limits_{{\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {k = 1} \\\\ {k \\ne j} \\\\ \\end{array} }}^{n}
    \\lambda_{k} y_{jk} - s_{j}^{ + } = y_{j}\\quad j = 1,2, \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot, q
    } \\\\{\\lambda_{k} \\ge 0,\\quad k = 1, \\ldots , n } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\\\
    {s_{i}^{ - } \\ge 0, s_{j}^{ + } \\ge 0 } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. \\hfill
    \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$ (2) For the k th Decision-Making Units (DMU), \\({x}_{ik}\\)
    denote the i th input indicator, \\({y}_{jk}\\) represent the j th output indicator.
    and \\({s}_{i}^{-}\\) and \\({s}_{j}^{+}\\) are input and output slack variables,
    respectively. \\({\\lambda }_{k}\\) denote the weight coefficient. θ is the comprehensive
    production efficiency. When AWE is calculated, θ is obtained. Equation (1) defines
    the way we use to calculate water use efficiency, and Eq. (2) defines linear programming
    inequalities which solve for the optimal agricultural water input for each province
    at each time period. Once the optimal agricultural water input is solved from
    a DEA solver software, agricultural water use efficiency can be calculated with
    Eq. (1). The variables included in the super-efficient DEA model are as follows:
    the amount of pesticide sprayed to agricultural produce is used to calculate pesticide
    input. Fertilizer input is calculated using the quantity of nitrogen and phosphate
    fertilizer applied to agricultural produce. In agricultural production, diesel
    consumption is used as a surrogate for energy input. The total input of plastic
    film used in agricultural production is referred to as agricultural film. Land
    input is represented by the total area planted. Water input is proxied by total
    agricultural water usage. The yield value of the agricultural planting business
    is employed as a measure of production value. In addition, to avoid the influence
    of inflation, production estimates are deflated using 2002 as the base year. Figure
    1 depicts the time trend of agricultural water use efficiency in China. The gray
    areas reflect the differences in agricultural water use efficiency between different
    regions of China. Figure 1 The time trend of China’s provincial level agricultural
    water efficiency. Full size image Energy poverty measures The energy poverty indicators
    we have chosen reflect to some extent the local level of energy development. The
    main components are: individuals’ consumption of energy, which is the most basic
    level of energy development in a region. Individuals’ access to clean energy,
    which reflects the level of sophistication of a region’s energy mix. The energy-intensive
    furniture and equipment owned by people, which characterize the standard of living
    of individuals and the capacity of local energy facilities to supply energy. The
    level of energy management, a higher level of energy facilities requires investment
    in construction and capital, and careful management15,16. The energy poverty index
    is calculated using the Improved Entropy Method with methodology details presented
    in the online Supplementary material S1. Specific indicators for energy poverty
    measurement are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Energy poverty indicators. Full size
    table Econometric model The influence of China’s EP on AWE is investigated in
    this study. Therefore, AWE is the dependent variable and EP is the independent
    variable. This research uses dynamic panel techniques to investigate the potential
    lag effects of AWE; the econometric model is constructed as follows: $$Ln{AWE}_{it}=\\alpha
    +{\\beta }_{0}Ln{AWE}_{i,t-1}+{\\beta }_{1}{EP}_{it}+{\\beta }_{2}{X}_{it}+{\\varepsilon
    }_{it}$$ (3) where i signifies the analysis province and t denotes the year that
    the variable relates to. \\({\\varepsilon }_{it}\\) denotes the random disturbance
    term with an independent and identical distribution. α stands for the intercept
    term. The estimated coefficients are denoted by \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) (i ≥ 1). AWE
    stands for agricultural water efficiency. EP stands for energy poverty. X represents
    a vector that contains a collection of control variables, mainly consisting of
    the degree of water-saving irrigation (SAVE), education in rural areas (EDU),
    grain size per capital (GSC), water resource adequacy (WRA), and urbanization
    (URB). Section 3.1 calculates agricultural water efficiency, whereas Sect. 3.2
    calculates energy poverty. Furthermore, SAVE is calculated by dividing the water-saving
    irrigated area by the cultivated area. The fraction of the rural population with
    a high school diploma or above determines EDU. GSC is computed by dividing the
    area under cultivation by the number of farmers (thousand hectares/10 thousand
    persons). GSC represents the magnitude of agricultural output to some degree.
    WRA is derived by dividing regional water resources by crop area (100 million
    cubic metres per thousand hectares). URB refers to the percentage of permanent
    urban inhabitants in a region’s overall population. Table 2 offers descriptive
    data for these factors. Table 2 Summary statistics of variables in the econometric
    model. Full size table Results Cross-sectional dependency Before conducting a
    meaningful econometric analysis, the existence of cross-sectional dependence in
    panel data must be evaluated. Unreliability and inconsistencies in empirical data
    analysis results are often attributed to a failure to consider cross-sectional
    independence17. As a result, the Friedman test18, the Breusch-Pagan LM test19,
    the Pesaran CD test20, and the Frees test21 are used in this research to examine
    cross-sectional dependence. The results of the four tests of cross-sectional dependence
    are shown in Table 3. All statistics are significant at the 1% level. Therefore,
    we strongly disprove the null hypothesis, which states that there is no cross-sectional
    dependence. This indicates that the cross-sectional units were not independent
    in this research. Consequently, the cross-sectional dependence present in the
    data must be considered while performing the subsequent empirical investigation.
    Table 3 Results of the cross-sectional dependence tests. Full size table The impact
    of energy poverty on agricultural water efficiency Because of the potential for
    endogeneity issues during the estimating process, appropriate econometric strategies
    are required in order to determine the effect that energy poverty has on AWE,
    which is the primary focus of this research. To begin, it is possible that erroneous
    measurements are what really create endogeneity. Especially prevalent in the social
    sciences is this problem since measurement of variables is hardly free from measurement
    error22,23. There is also the possibility of endogeneity due to omitted variable
    bias, which occurs when key variables are neglected in the model22,23. System
    generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) has proven to be an effective statistical
    tool for handling issues of heterogeneity, endogeneity, and estimate bias22,23.
    SYS-GMM estimation method takes into account lagged values of the dependent variables
    to create internal instruments that resolve endogeneity problems22,23. The current
    levels of a phenomenon are best understood by looking at the values of lagged
    variables. The introduction of lags, according to Ullah''s study, addresses the
    problem of \"too many instruments.\"22. System GMM (SYS-GMM) are employed as the
    benchmark method in this study. OLS, random effects model (RE), One-way fixed
    effects model (One-way FE) and difference GMM were used as robustness tests. Among
    the five estimation approaches, the sign and statistical significance of EP are
    basically consistent, indicating that the empirical results of this study are
    robust and reliable (Table 4). Table 4 Estimation of EP-AWE nexus. Full size table
    Table 4 shows the Sargan test results. According to Roodman (2009), the Sargan
    test of the two-step GMM estimates yields non-significant p-values, indicating
    that all instrumental variables used in this study have validity24. With all five
    estimating methodologies, the influence of EP on AWE is negative and statistically
    significant, as shown in Table 3. For every one percent increase in energy poverty,
    AWE drops by around 0.056%. Improving AWE is critical to addressing water scarcity
    and ensuring food security. Energy poverty has a negative impact on the efficiency
    of water use in agriculture. Energy poverty reflects the level of development
    of energy infrastructure, such as the availability of electricity. Agricultural
    production systems are unable to use input factors efficiently due to inadequate
    energy supply. Many irrigation systems and water saving technologies require energy
    support and supply to operate. Although China has invested in the construction
    of many irrigation facilities, a stable supply of energy is required for the good
    operation of irrigation facilities. Many rural areas in China are still dominated
    by smallholder forms of production and lack the motivation and capacity to fund
    the management of irrigation systems and subsequent supporting energy facilities.
    This is an important reason why China has been making great efforts to develop
    the level of energy infrastructure in rural areas in recent years, and the Chinese
    government has made some achievements to achieve universal access to rural power
    electricity in 2020. According to the SYS-GMM findings on control factors, EDU
    contributes to AWE. Better educated farmers are more likely to have sophisticated
    production expertise and irrigation methods that increase agricultural water use
    efficiency. AWE increases with the degree of SAVE, showing that water-saving irrigation
    is important for efficiency. GSC has a favorable impact on AWE. In China, a large
    number of smallholder farmers continue to dominate agricultural production. Increasing
    GSC minimizes the surplus of unproductive agricultural labor and increases AWE
    by promoting labor substitution through technology. Discussion Asymmetric analysis
    The 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th quartiles of the AWE were estimated to account
    for unobserved heterogeneity in order to quantify the asymmetry of the impact
    of energy poverty on agricultural water use efficiency. The main two-step panel
    quantile regression was used25. The estimated results are summarized in Table
    5. Furthermore, at various quantile stages, Fig. 2 demonstrates the varied patterns
    of change in the parameters of affecting factors. EP and control factors affect
    AWE to different degrees at different quartile levels. When AWE is low, energy
    poverty has a stronger negative impact. At higher levels of AWE, the negative
    impact of energy poverty fades away. For the control variables, it is worth noting
    that as AWE increases, the role of urbanization level becomes more and more important,
    suggesting that higher levels of AWE need to be driven by regional economic development.

    possibility is that irrigation machinery cannot be used without energy26,27, so
    energy poverty may have reduced the number of irrigation machinery, thus affecting
    AWE. SDG2 explicitly proposes to promote non-farm employment for small-scale food
    producers. Furthermore, in the study of rural China, non-farm work has always
    been an unavoidable issue28,29. Farm families’ human capital and cognitive capacity
    may be eroded as a result of energy poverty30,31,32, compromising their ability
    to work outside of the farm. Non-farm employment promotes farmers to invest more
    and master agricultural technology to improve agricultural water efficiency by
    improving agricultural income and cognitive ability26,29,33,34,35. Most importantly,
    non-agricultural employment can effectively address the issue that Chinese agricultural
    production is still dominated by a large number of scattered, small-scale food
    producers. It can promote land concentration and thus large-scale production,
    which clearly facilitates the adoption of community-based water-saving technologies.
    The literature has not taken into account the impact of energy poverty on cropping
    structure adjustment, which may be detrimental to cash crop cultivation, such
    as the inability to provide warm barns to withstand the cold. Cash crops, on the
    other hand, may promote agricultural water efficiency. For starters, cash crops
    can boost farm income, allowing farmers to invest in and maintain water-saving
    irrigation systems. Second, cash crops frequently necessitate fine-grained management
    and good infrastructure, both of which aid in reducing water waste and increasing
    AWE. In order to investigate the mechanism of how EP affects AWE, the quantity
    of water-saving irrigation equipment (WIM), non-farm work (NFW), and cropping
    structure adjustment (CSA) are employed as mediating factors in this model. The
    number of water-saving irrigation machines is referred to as WIM. NFW is proxied
    by the ratio of non-agricultural employment to total employment. The percentage
    of vegetable planted area to all crops seeded is used to calculate CSA. The following
    is the mediating effect model that was used to investigate the mechanism: $$Ln{AWE}_{it}={\\delta
    }_{1}Ln{EP}_{it}+{\\beta }_{1}{X}_{it}+{\\phi }_{it}$$ (4) $$Ln{M}_{it}={\\delta
    }_{2}Ln{EP}_{it}+{\\beta }_{2}{X}_{it}+{\\mu }_{it}$$ (5) $$Ln{AWE}_{it}={\\delta
    }_{3}Ln{EP}_{it}+{\\delta }_{4}Ln{M}_{it}+{\\beta }_{3}{X}_{it}+{\\gamma }_{it}$$
    (6) where i signifies the analyses’ cross-sectional unit. And t stands for time
    periods, while AWE stands for agricultural water efficiency at the provincial
    level. EP stands for energy poverty. X presents a set of control factors to the
    user. WIM, OFM, and CSA are among the mediators represented by M. EP’s entire
    impacts on AWE are represented by \\({\\delta }_{1}\\). \\({\\delta }_{3}\\) denotes
    the direct influence of EP on AWE. In addition, \\({\\delta }_{2}\\cdot {\\delta
    }_{4}\\) is the indirect impact. Results of the mediation effect analysis Table
    6 shows the estimated results of the mediation influence mechanism. First and
    foremost, the overall effects of EP on AWE (\\({\\delta }_{1}\\)) are statistically
    significant, as shown in Column (1) of Table 6, and the elasticity is − 0.504.
    Second, Table 6’s Columns (2)–(4) demonstrate that \\({\\delta }_{2}\\) of the
    mediators, WIM, NFW, and CSA, are both statistically significant at the 1% level,
    with elasticities of − 2.002, − 0.274, and − 0.501, respectively. EP had a negative
    influence on the WIM, NFW, and CSA, according to these data. Third, the coefficients
    of WIM, NFW, and CSA are all statistically significant, with elasticities of 0.087,
    0.346, and 0.116, respectively, as shown in Columns (5)–(7). WIM, NFW, and CSA
    are all substantial contributors to AWE, as seen by this. The EP coefficient,
    on the other hand, falls, indicating that the mediators are partly mediating.
    Table 6 Mechanism analysis results. Full size table Energy poverty has an immediate
    and negative impact on AWE, as well as three intermediary channels. Energy poverty
    reduces the availability of water-saving irrigation machinery, lowering AWE. Energy
    poverty discourages non-agricultural employment. The lack of non-farm employment
    reduces farm households’ ability to invest in and maintain irrigation facilities.
    As a result, non-agricultural employment is a critical channel for EP to reduce
    AWE. Farmers are discouraged from growing high-value cash crops like vegetables
    due to energy shortages. Energy poverty makes it difficult to build facilities
    for high-value cash crops that require energy inputs, such as greenhouses that
    can stay warm during cold winters. Farmers are unable to increase their income
    due to their inability to grow high-value cash crops, and they lack the incentive
    or resources to support more advanced irrigation management facilities. Conclusions
    The study''s primary discoveries can be summarized as follows: (1) The efficiency
    of agricultural water utilization in China experiences a detrimental impact due
    to the presence of energy poverty. More precisely, a 1% rise in energy poverty
    is associated with a 0.056% decrease in agricultural water efficiency. As a result,
    the condition of energy poverty exerts an adverse influence on the efficiency
    of agricultural water utilization. (2) Based on the findings of an asymmetrical
    study, an enhancement in agricultural water efficiency leads to a diminishing
    detrimental effects of energy poverty while the beneficial effects of urbanization
    become more significant. (3) According to the findings of mechanism analysis,
    energy poverty diminishes agricultural water efficiency by limiting the availability
    of irrigation water-saving machinery and hinders samllholder farmers from accessing
    off-farm employment opportunities. Furthermore, energy poverty adversely affects
    agricultural water efficiency by altering the cropping structure. The aforementioned
    research findings carry several important policy implications. Firstly, it is
    evident from empirical results that the reduction of energy poverty is crucial
    in enhancing irrigation efficiency. Hence, it is important for the government
    to ascertain the underlying factors contributing to energy poverty among small-scale
    food producers in order to facilitate the implementation of tailored solutions.
    Energy poverty can potentially impact small-scale food producers, primarily as
    a consequence of inadequate infrastructure or limited household income. Policies
    aimed at augmenting infrastructure investment are implemented to cater to the
    needs of small-scale food producers who face challenges due to inadequate energy
    infrastructure. Off-site relocation can be employed as a strategy to facilitate
    the migration of individuals facing energy poverty towards regions characterized
    by improved infrastructure. In light of inadequate household income, it is recommended
    that the government extend energy subsidies and agricultural production subsidies
    to small-scale food producers. Special consideration should be granted to small-scale
    food producers due to the government''s implementation of a clean energy transition,
    which has led to an increase in energy costs. Furthermore, as agricultural water
    usage becomes more efficient, the negative impacts of energy poverty diminish
    while the positive effects of expanded production become more pronounced. In regions
    with low agricultural water use efficiency, it is imperative to prioritize the
    elimination of energy poverty and the enhancement of energy infrastructure as
    means to enable effective irrigation practices. Further improvements in agricultural
    water use efficiency at advanced stages can be achieved through the utilization
    of cutting-edge technology and financial assistance provided by the local economic
    development initiatives. Thirdly, studies examining potential impact pathways
    indicate that water-saving irrigation equipment, non-farm employment, and cropping
    structure are three significant mediating factors. The correlation between energy
    poverty and agricultural water efficiency (AWE) is evident and understandable
    due to the constraining effect on irrigation equipment accessibility. Moreover,
    energy poverty impedes the progress of non-farm employment. Energy poverty has
    a detrimental impact on the human capital of farmers, thereby constraining their
    occupational options to non-agricultural sectors that necessitate elevated levels
    of skill proficiency. Meanwhile, the presence of energy poverty in urban areas
    hinders their capacity to accommodate and utilize rural labor. Enhancing the educational
    attainment in rural areas and providing vocational training to underdeveloped
    regions can contribute to the augmentation of farmers'' human capital and the
    promotion of non-agricultural employment. Consequently, this can help alleviate
    the adverse effects of poverty on irrigation efficiency. The eradication of energy
    poverty and the promotion of rural non-farm employment have positive implications
    for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency. Furthermore, the presence of
    energy poverty acts as a hindrance to the cultivation of lucrative crops. The
    cultivation of lucrative crops has the potential to enhance agricultural water
    efficiency (AWE) by augmenting farmers'' income and necessitating more meticulous
    resource management. This, in turn, incentivizes farmers to allocate greater investments
    towards the improvement of irrigation systems. In the context of enhancing energy
    infrastructure, it is advisable for the government to consider providing subsidies
    to farmers, offering training programs to enhance their skills, promoting the
    adoption of advanced management techniques for cultivating high-value lucrative
    crops, augmenting farmers'' income, and enhancing irrigation facilities. This
    study is subject to several limitations. First, the lack of detailed data restricts
    the ability to make more nuanced conclusions, particularly regarding the inclusion
    of temporal data at a quarterly or monthly level. Second, the study sample is
    limited to the provincial level, overlooking potential variations within cities
    or counties of the same province. Third, this study only focuses on a macro water
    use perspective and doesn’t differentiate water use efficiency by crop types.
    Different types of crops may have heterogeneous energy and water requirements,
    therefore disaggregated water use data by crop types can yield more accurate statistical
    resutls. Future studies could address these limitations by incorporating novel
    sources of refined data, such as satellite remote sensing data, high-frequency
    energy consumption data, and disaggregated water use data by specific crop types.

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and
    F1 score are used as performance parameter [22]. $$ \\begin{aligned} {\\text{Accuracy}}

    random forest (93 percet) and naïve bayes classifier (87 percent). The amount
    of fresh water save d by Kmeans-SVM hybrid technique based irrigation system is
    42 percent. 5 Conclusion Precision agriculture depends on being able to predict
    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that
    support the findings of this study are openly available at [http://smartfasal.in/precision_agriculture_datasets/],

    access 16 February 2024 Introduction Rice is a major food crop that feeds 50%
    of the world’s population, although many abiotic stresses, particularly salt stress,
    endanger its yield. Around 20% of the world’s cultivated land and 33% of its irrigated
    agricultural land is affected by salinity stress [1]. Salinity is one of the vital
    abiotic stresses that not only reduce significantly agricultural production but
    also deteriorates the cultivated lands. It influences 830 million hectares of
    arable land all over the world [2] and causes around two million uncultivable
    lands yearly [3]. To sustain production and to meet the global food security demands,
    it is critical to discover stress-tolerant rice cultivars. Multi-stress tolerant
    Green Super Rice (GSR) has been developed with resistance to salinity, drought,
    cold, heat, insects, and flooding with better nutrient and water use efficiency
    [4,5,6,7,8]. GSR has resulted in an exemplary shift in crop genetic advancement
    goals and food production models for promoting sustainable agriculture. GSR is
    a critical concept proposed to meet the challenge of attaining environmentally
    friendly and resource-saving crops because GSR genotypes can maintain stable and
    higher yields with fewer inputs, as well as have higher resistance and survival
    rates to combat extreme climate change [9]. Salt stress in plants triggers several
    complicated signaling pathways and is owed to the collegial interactions of salt-stress-sensitive
    genes with other stress signal transduction pathways components [10]. Plants adapt
    to salt stress via different molecular mechanisms that involve regulation of ion
    homeostasis, cell wall composition, cytoskeleton dynamics, activation of plant
    hormone signaling, and osmotic stress pathway [11]. Phytohormones are the crucial
    signal molecules that regulate the growth and development of plants in both normal
    and stressed settings. Several phytohormones that respond and help to tolerate
    salt stress are abscisic acid (ABA), indole acetic acid (IAA), ethylene (ETH),
    jasmonic acid (JA), gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinin (CK), salicylic acid (SA),
    brassinosteroids (BR), and triazoles (TR) [12, 13]. Plants also adapt to salt
    stress through complicated physiological mechanisms that involve alterations of
    the metabolites. Changes in metabolite level are a good indicator of cell physiological
    conditions prediction than protein level because metabolites are produced as an
    outcome of interactions between different genes in different pathways as a result
    of stress [14], and polyamines (PAs) are involved in osmotic tolerance during
    salt stress [15]. The next-generation sequencing technology based on transcriptomes
    allows us to get deeper insights into the molecular and physiological processes
    that help plants to tolerate and recover from biotic and abiotic stresses [16].
    Comparative transcriptomics-based RNA-seq data help in how plants regulate their
    molecular and cellular mechanism, change transcriptome and stimulate the stress
    tolerance pathways to survive external stresses. Understanding the differentially
    expressed genes and how they interact in various tissues under various stress
    circumstances can help us better understand how stress stimulates transcriptional
    changes [16]. Transcriptome studies have been performed on rice with salt stress
    for 24 h in a 150 mM NaCl [17] and a 200 mM NaCl solution [18], 3 days in an 85
    mM NaCl [19], and a 200 mM NaCl solution [20, 21], 5 days in 250 mM NaCl solution
    [22], and for 7 days in 50 mM NaCl [23], 125 mM NaCl [24], and 150 mM NaCl solution
    [25]. The global yield losses in rice crop majorly caused by salinity, that can
    be reduced by hunting the pre-breeding information in prevailing rice germplasm
    and identifying the novel genes in salt tolerant. Comparative transcriptome analysis
    between contrasting genotypes could help in identifying the novel genes and understanding
    the pathways underlying the salt tolerance in rice [19, 21, 23, 24]. In this study,
    we have performed comparative transcriptome studies at a seedling stage between
    two GSR varieties with different tolerance levels to salt stress. Comparative
    transcriptome analysis between contrasting genotypes could help in understanding
    the pathways underlying salt tolerance in rice. Methods Plant growth and treatment
    Previously our research group identified 10 salt-tolerant and 12 salt-susceptible
    genotypes out of 22 GSR genotypes evaluated under the salt stress [6]. We herein
    selected two genotypes GSR-54 (S13) and GSR-305 (S3) with contrasting tolerance
    to salt stress. The seeds of salt-tolerant GSR-54 (S13) and salt-susceptible GSR-305
    (S3) were sterilized with 30% hydrogen peroxide solution germinated in Petri dishes
    under 14 h light, 10 h dark, 28 °C (day), and 24 °C (night) conditions for 3 days.
    The germinated seeds were transferred to plastic trays containing Yoshida medium
    under growth chamber conditions. To compare the effect of salinity on both genotypes
    at the transcriptome level, seeds of GSR-54 and GSR-305 were grown in normal conditions
    for 30 days. Half of the seedlings were transferred to a culture solution supplemented
    with 140 mM NaCl for 12 days. The remaining seedlings left for normal growth were
    used as control plants. At the 42-day developmental stage, root samples were collected
    from both control and salt-stressed plants and stored in liquid nitrogen at − 80
    °C until RNA extraction. RNA isolation, library construction, and RNA sequencing
    Two biological replicates for control and three biological replicates for stress
    conditions of each genotype were used for transcriptome profiling. Total RNA was
    extracted from the roots of each sample using the phenol/chloroform method. The
    purity test of RNA was undertaken using NanoDrop 2000 & 8000 micro spectrophotometer.
    The concentration and integrity of RNA samples were tested with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
    using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. cDNA libraries were constructed using the
    manufacturer’s standard procedures and subsequent cDNA libraries were sequenced
    by the paired-end (2 bp × 150 bp) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. Identification
    of differentially expressed genes Raw sequencing data were assessed for quality
    with FastQC v0.11.9 [26]. Adaptor contamination and poor-quality bases were trimmed
    using Trimmomatic v0.39 [27]. Clean reads were mapped against reference assembly
    IRGSP 1.0 (https://plants.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) with HISAT2 v2.2.1
    [28]. Gene level quantification was performed with featureCounts v2.0.0 [29].
    Differential gene expression analysis and exploratory data analysis were performed
    using the DESeq2 package (1.34.0) [30] in R. Genes that satisfied the threshold
    value of false discovery rate (Padj) < 0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ 2 or ≤ – 2 were classified
    as differentially expressed genes. Discovery of novel transcripts expressed under
    salt stress Stringtie v2.1.1 [31] was used to carry out the de novo assembly of
    transcripts with mapped reads from HISAT2 output. The merge utility of Stringtie
    merged the transcripts from all samples in a way that resulted in a unified set
    of transcripts based on genomic coordinates from all conditions. Novel transcripts
    were compared to a known reference gene model from Ensembl Plants (https://plants.ensembl.org)
    and genes with single exons were discarded. FASTA sequences of novel transcripts
    were also retrieved for annotation. To identify the protein-coding potential of
    novel transcripts we used Transdecoder v5.5.0 (http://transdecoder.github.io)
    to predict open reading frames (ORFs) with default parameters. Novel genes were
    annotated by blast against Nr, Swiss-prot, Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, and EuKaryotic
    Orthologous Group (KOG) databases with an e-value threshold of 1e-10 and max-target-seqs
    1. Protein sequences were scanned against the Pfam database by HMMER v3.3 to identify
    the functional domains in novel genes based on homology. Enrichment analysis GO
    accessions were added to identified DEGs using biomartr package v1.0.2 [32] in
    R. Only the genes with identified GO terms were used for enrichment analysis.
    Custom annotation database of rice for enrichment analysis of DEGs was made using
    AnnotationForge package v1.39.2 [33] in R. ClusterProfiler v4.0 [34] was used
    to perform Gene set enrichment analysis in R. KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs based
    on P-value < 0.05 threshold was also performed with ClusterProfiler for identifying
    significantly enriched pathways. The P-value was corrected as described by the
    Benjamini–Hochberg method. Classification of transcription factors in DEGs Transcription
    factors serve several important functions in biological processes from the development
    of the plant to the stress tolerance control [35]. For identification and classification
    of transcription factors, protein sequences of differentially expressed genes
    identified in four comparisons were retrieved using BioMart in Ensembl Plants
    (https://plants.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/) and submitted to iTAK—Plant Transcription
    factor & Protein Kinase Identifier and Classifier tool (http://itak.feilab.net/cgi-bin/itak/index.cgi,
    Accessed on 1st August 2022). Identification of SNP variations For SNP calling,
    clean reads were mapped against reference assembly using the STAR v2.7.10a [36]
    2-pass method with default parameters. Mapped files were sorted by coordinate
    and converted to BAM files. SNP sites were identified by a single base mismatch
    between the reference site and sample site using the GATK v4.2.1.0 [37] pipeline.
    SNPs were filtered based on three criteria: (a) no more than three consecutive
    SNPs within 35 bp of windows size, (b) the sequencing depth of SNPs was between
    5 and 100 bp, and (c) genotype qualities were bigger than 20. SnpEff v5.1d [38]
    was used to identify the location of SNPs on the reference genome regions and
    their impact on the protein products. The SNP density on each chromosome was determined
    using an in-house R script. Validation through quantitative PCR Six differentially
    expressed genes (DEGs) were selected randomly to validate the results of RNA sequencing;
    including growth-regulating factor interacting factor 1 Os03g0733600 (OsGIF1)
    [39], U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase Os01g0823900 (OsPUB3) [40], 12-oxophytodienoic
    acid reductase, Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense signaling Os02g0559400 (OsOPR8)
    [41], CBL-interacting protein kinase 5 Os01g0206700 (OsCIPK5) ( [42]), Squamosa
    promoter-binding-like protein Os06g0659100 (OsSPL10) [43], and Similar to Globulin
    1 expressed protein Os08g0127900 (OsEnS-115). Gene-specific primers for selected
    DEGs were designed with Primer3 (https://primer3.ut.ee/) (Supplementary Table
    S1). In addition, Real-time quantitative (q) PCR was performed with three replicates
    for both control and salt stress treatments in salt-sensitive S3 and salt-tolerant
    S13 genotypes. For this purpose, 1 g of RNA was converted into cDNA by using a
    cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed in Applied
    Biosystems Prism 7500HT Real-time Sequence Detection System using 2 × SYBR Green
    PCR Master Mix (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan). Relative gene expression level was calculated
    for each gene relative to the Actin1 gene using the delta CT method. A bar chart
    graph was made to show the relative expression of selected DEGs based on fold
    change (log2FC) values. PCA and correlation analysis Principal component (PCA)
    and correlation analysis were conducted in the R 3.4.5 by using different packages
    (magrittr, ade4, FactoMineR, factoextra, and ggplot2). Results RNA sequencing
    and alignment After removing poor-quality bases and adaptor sequences, we obtained
    68.38 Gb of clean data, with Q30 values for each library being higher than 92%
    (Table 1). The clean reads were annotated with reference assembly and the mapping
    statistics showed that 93.03–96.49% of total reads were mapped (Table 1). Table
    1 Sequencing data and alignment summary statistics Full size table Exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) We performed the exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess
    the quality of samples and the relationship between biological replicates. The
    results of principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the first two
    PCs covered 82% of the total variation and three biological replicates of treated
    samples from each genotype were individually clustered and two biological replicates
    of control samples from each genotype were individually clustered (Fig. 1A). The
    hierarchical clustering pattern showed a high consistency and low variability
    between biological replicates (Fig. 1B). PCA also confirm that genotypes S3 and
    S13 have different salt tolerance level. This large difference between all groups
    based on PCA suggests that salt-responsive genes might be the main cause of between-group
    differences. Identification of differentially expressed genes The differential
    gene expression analysis under salt stress was carried out with the pairwise comparisons
    of S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl
    vs. S13-ctrl in roots. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes obtained from
    four comparisons were 3,982, 3,463, 977, and 596 DEGs in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt,
    S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl (Supplementary
    Table S2). More DEGs were identified in the salt-susceptible S3 line than in the
    salt-tolerant S13 line indicating that many DEGs were involved in the salt stress
    responses (Fig. 1C). A Venn diagram of DEGs under salt stress was generated to
    identify the number of genes expressed specifically in a single comparison and
    the number of genes that overlap between four comparisons (Fig. 1D). Both lines
    shared 1894 consistently regulated DEGs, suggesting shared mechanisms of salt
    response. Additionally, the 1271 DEGs that were selectively regulated in the salt-tolerant
    S13 might be a representation of the candidate genes for salt stress tolerance.
    There were 1821 regulated DEGs found only in the salt-susceptible S3. Only 10
    DEGs were found in the overlap region of these four comparisons. A total of 1115
    up-regulated DEGs were shared between S3 and S13 genotypes compared to salt stress.
    Out of these 1115 genes, 140 genes were involved in transport activities, 113
    genes were involved in different metabolic processes, 66 genes were associated
    with kinase activity, and 56 genes belonged to different Transcription factors
    (TFs) expressed under salt stress. Fig. 1 Exploratory data analysis and RNA-seq
    analysis. A Principal component analysis plot of normalized and variance stabilized
    counts from DESeq2. Samples with similar expressions are grouped closely. B Hierarchical
    clustering of samples based on log2 transformed gene counts showing a correlation

    A number of differentially expressed genes were identified between four groups
    i.e., S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl, S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, and S3-salt
    vs. S13-salt. D Venn diagram representing the differentially expressed genes overlapping
    between four groups Full size image Gene set enrichment analysis For all DEGs
    identified in the four pairwise comparisons, a total of 2589 (65.01%), 2188 (63.18%),
    559 (57.22%), and 296 (49.66%) DEGs were assigned GO terms in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt,
    S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl, respectively.
    We identified enriched GO terms in these four groups based on a P-value. There
    were 162 and 150 GO terms enriched in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt and S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt
    (Fig. 2). No GO-enriched term was identified in S3-salt vs. S13-salt and S3-ctrl
    vs. S13-ctrl. We have also identified the over-represented GO terms in these four
    groups (Supplementary Table S3). In the salt-tolerant genotype S13, genes of high
    significance were enriched in biological processes that involved response to stress,
    and regulation of different metabolic, and biosynthesis processes. Whereas in
    salt-susceptible genotype S3, genes were significantly enriched in cellular components
    that involved organelle, membrane-bounded organelle, intracellular anatomical
    structure, and cytoplasm. For biological process terms, genes in both genotypes
    (S3 and S13) were enriched in metabolic processes, biosynthesis, and response
    to hormones, stimuli, and stress. For molecular function ontology, transport,
    binding, and catalytic activities were the significantly enriched terms in both
    genotypes (S3 and S13). For cellular components, genes were enriched in cytoplasm,
    membrane, and non-membrane bounded organelles and cellular anatomical entities.
    Common enriched terms shared by both salt-susceptible and -tolerant genotypes
    imply the common mechanism in GSR varieties to overcome the salt stress. 1241
    and 1106 genes were enriched in different metabolic processes in salt-susceptible
    (S3) and salt-tolerant (S13) genotypes, which suggest high metabolic activity
    under salt stress. The up-regulated genes were particularly enriched in binding
    activity and metabolic processes. Salt-susceptible genotype has a greater number
    of genes involved in metabolism suggesting high metabolic activity needed for
    its survival under salt stress. Fig. 2 Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
    of DEGs. A Boxplot of gene ontology of terms enriched in biological processes
    (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) in salt-susceptible
    S3 genotype. B Boxplot of gene ontology of terms enriched in biological processes,
    cellular component, and molecular function in salt-tolerant S13 genotype. The
    vertical axis shows the number of gene counts for each enriched term. P < 0.05
    value was used Full size image KEGG pathway enrichment analysis To identify the
    pathways that are enriched under salt stress, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment
    analysis using up and down-regulated DEGs identified from a pairwise comparison
    in S3-ctrl vs S3-salt and S13-ctrl vs S13-salt. The results showed that DEGs upregulated
    in the S3 genotype under salt stress were enriched in the ‘Biosynthesis of secondary
    metabolites’, ‘Alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism’, ‘MAPK signaling pathway - plant’,
    and ‘Plant hormone signal transduction pathways (Fig. 3A). In the S13 genotype
    up-regulated DEGs were enriched in ‘Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’, ‘Cutin, suberine,
    and wax biosynthesis’, ‘Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, and ‘Plant hormone
    signal transduction pathways (Fig. 3B). However, DEGs down-regulated in the S13
    genotype were not enriched in any pathway. There were 49 and 47 up-regulated DEGs
    for ‘Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in S13 and S3 genotypes. However, 18
    and 13 DEGs were up-regulated for ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ in S3 and
    S13 genotypes. Both pathways are highly linked to the response to salt stress
    in plants. Fig. 3 KEGG enrichment analysis of up-regulated differentially expressed
    genes. A Bubble plot of pathways up-regulated significantly in salt-susceptible

    the P-value corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg method Full size image Alpha-linolenic
    acid metabolism Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant signaling molecule that imparts
    stress tolerance in plants [44]. Under salt stress, 9 genes that regulate α-linolenic
    acid (the precursor of JA) metabolism were differentially expressed in the salt-susceptible
    S3 genotype and 6 genes were differentially expressed in salt tolerant S13 genotype.
    The allene oxide synthase 4 AOS4 (Os02g0218800) gene was downregulated in both
    genotypes. OsOPR8 (Os02g0559400) and OsOPR4 (Os06g0215900) genes involved in JA
    biosynthesis were up-regulated in the salt-tolerant S13 genotype suggesting more
    tolerance in this genotype as compared to S3. Lipoxygenase OsLOX7 (Os05g0304600)
    was downregulated while OsLOX8 (Os08g0509100) was up-regulated in S13. OsLOX2
    (Os08g0508800) was up-regulated in both S3 and S13. The downregulation of 2 genes
    (AOS4 and OsLOX7) responsible for JA biosynthesis in salt-tolerant S13 could be
    due to a longer stress period of 12 days as many salt-responsive genes respond
    at earlier induction of salt. Hydroperoxide lyase gene OsHPL3 (Os02g0110200) was
    up-regulated while OsHPL2 (Os02g0218700) was downregulated in S3. Gene like Quinone-oxidoreductase
    QR1 (Os09g0503100) was also up-regulated in S3. Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase
    1 OsJMT1 (Os05g0102000), Acyl-CoA oxidase ACX2 (Os11g0605500), Fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase
    PIOX (Os12g0448900), and OsLOX11 (Os12g0559200) were downregulated in S3 as well.
    A total of 6 genes were downregulated in S3 for α-linolenic acid metabolism suggesting
    reduced salt tolerance in contrast to the S13. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis Phenylpropanoids
    are a class of secondary metabolites that are derived from phenylalanine and perform
    crucial functions in the life of plants. In our findings, 23 DEGs involved in
    phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were expressed in both genotypes under salt stress.
    There were 9 DEGs up-regulated and 14 DEGs down-regulated in salt-sensitive S3.
    Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2C1 OsALDH2C1 (Os01g0591300), Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
    1 PAL1 (Os02g0627100), Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase 3 OsHCT3 (Os06g0184900), and
    Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3 OsCAD3 (Os10g0430200) were up-regulated in both
    S3 and S13 genotypes. While Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase OsPAL (Os02g0626100) and
    Ferulate-5-hydroxylase 2 OsF5HL2 (Os03g0112900) were down-regulated in both genotypes.
    Cinnamoyl CoA reductase 19 OsCCR19 (Os09g0419200) was up-regulated in S3 and cinnamoyl
    CoA reductase 1 OsCCR1 (Os02g0808800) was down-regulated in S13. Phenylalanine
    ammonia-lyase 4 OsPAL4 (Os05g0427400) and 4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase for lignin
    biosynthesis Os4CL5 (Os08g0448000) were also up-regulated in salt-tolerant S13.
    Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 7 OsPAL7 (Os04g0518400) and two genes for Caffeoyl-CoA
    3-O-methyltransferase OsCOA1 (Os06g0165800 and Os09g0481400) were down-regulated
    in S13. Class III peroxidases (PRXs) are the plant-specific enzymes that are involved
    in the various biotic and abiotic stress responses [45]. There were 16 and 11
    class III PRX genes differentially expressed in S3 and S13 genotypes. prx32 (Os02g0833900)
    was up-regulated, while prx41 (Os03g0339300), prx51 (Os03g0762400), prx109 (Os07g0676900),
    and prx125 (Os10g0109300) were down-regulated in both S3 and S13 genotypes. In
    S3 specifically, genes for prx22 (Os01g0963000), prx130 (Os11g0112400), and prx132
    (Os11g0210100) were up-regulated while genes for prx15 (Os01g0327100), prx30 (Os02g0240100),
    prx43 (Os03g0368300), prx64 (Os04g0689000), prx65 (Os05g0134400), prx110 (Os07g0677100),
    prx115 (Os07g0677600), and prx136-like (Os12g0111800) were down-regulated. In
    S13 particularly, prx11 (Os01g0294700), prx29 (Os02g0240300), and prx118 (Os08g0302000)
    genes were up-regulated whereas prx87 (Os06g0547100), Os1-CysPrxA (Os07g0638300),
    and prx129 (Os10g0566800) genes were down-regulated. More PRX genes were down-regulated
    at 12-day stress conditions in both genotypes suggesting that the cell has overcome
    the oxidative stress induced by salt stress. Identification of various transcription
    factors regulated under salt stress Transcription factors regulate the developmental
    processes, metabolic processes, and biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. A total
    of 228 and 204 transcription factors were identified that were up-regulated and
    down-regulated in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt (115, 106), S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt (87, 82),
    S3-salt vs. S13-salt (19, 11), and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl (7, 5) (Supplementary
    Table S4). These transcription factors included 41 families of transcription factors
    which are bHLH (42), ERF (36), NAC (30), WRKY (26), MYB (25), MYB_related (25),
    bZIP (23), C2H2 (18), HSF (15), B3 (14), SBP (14), GRAS (13), Dof (11), GATA (11),
    GRF (10), LBD (10), TCP (9), MIKC_MADS (8), C3H (7), DBB (7), G2-like (7), HD-ZIP
    (7), TALE (7), ARF (6), M-type_MADS (6), FAR1 (5), ZF-HD (5), AP2 (4), CO-like
    (4), E2F/DP (3), EIL (3), NF-YA (3), NF-YB (3), ARR-B (2), CPP (2), GeBP (2),
    HB-other (2), Trihelix (2), RAV (2), YABBY (2), and NF-X1 (1). bHLH, ERF, NAC,
    WRKY, MYB, MADS, and bZIP are salt stress-responsive transcription factors expressed
    in rice. Identification of novel genes The use of RNA-seq technology can help
    find novel genes that have been skipped in earlier studies because of their unique
    expression patterns or structural differences from genes that have been extensively
    studied. We have identified 5357 novel transcripts and 3978 novel genes that were
    expressed under salt stress. To predict the coding potential and open reading
    frames among all novel transcripts identified, we used Transdecoder. To identify
    the function of newly identified genes, protein sequences of these genes were
    compared to known annotations in Nr, Swissprot, GO, KEGG, and KOG databases. The
    transcoder has identified 1,806 unique genes with functional domains. In this
    study, 1368 novel genes were assigned GO terms. For cellular components, genes
    were abundant in the cellular anatomical entity (357), membrane (168), and cell
    periphery (104). For the biological process, 50 genes were involved in the defense
    response. Most genes were assigned molecular functions and the most common terms
    in this category were binding (254), organic cyclic compound binding (169), heterocyclic
    compound binding (168), ion binding (157), and anion binding (105). 1672 genes
    were identified when a blastp search was performed against the Nr database for
    Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica. While blastp search against the SwissProt database
    has identified 1067 unique genes. The search against the Pfam database has identified
    1,659 genes with the functional domain. We also performed a BLAST search against
    EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) database for the classification of novel genes
    into functional classes and the KOG term was assigned to 1282 novel genes. Most
    of the genes were grouped into a subgroup T (Signal transduction mechanism) (Fig.
    4). We used KOBAS for KEGG pathway annotation of newly identified genes which
    has annotated 1135 genes. A total of 36 and 16 genes were involved in metabolic
    pathways (dosa01100) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (dosa01110). Fig.

    10 SNP identification We compared the salt-susceptible S3 and salt-tolerant S13
    genotypes with the reference to look for potential SNPs that are involved in different
    responses under salt stress. We have identified 59,830 SNPs in 10 samples, including
    46,816 SNPs in genic regions and 13,014 SNPs in intergenic regions. The transitions
    type in each sample varied from 65.01 − 65.73% while the transversions type varied
    from 34.27–34.99% (Table 2). The heterozygosity rate for the samples ranged from
    4.50 to 17.21%. We also estimated the SNP density on each chromosome in non-overlapping
    bins of 1 Mb (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we estimated the DEGs density in non-overlapping
    bins of 1 Mb (Fig. 5B). The largest peak for SNP density was observed in (Chr5:2.6–2.7
    Mb), (Chr3:1.0 − 1.1 Mb), and (Chr3:3.4–3.5 Mb). The highest peaks for DEGs density
    were located at (Chr4:2.4–2.5 Mb), (Chr3:3.0–3.1 Mb), (Chr3:3.2−3.3 Mb), and (Chr4:2.2−2.3
    Mb) respectively. Table 2 Sequencing data and alignment summary statistics Full

    quantitative expression analysis of salt-induced genes In order to validate the
    expression of genes identified as differentially expressed in RNA-seq analysis,
    we used the total RNA from the roots of all samples for Real-time quantitative
    (q) PCR. Six genes that depicted different expression patterns between salt-sensitive
    S3 and salt-tolerant S13 genotypes were assayed (Fig. 6). Our results indicate
    that Squamosa promoter-binding like protein Os06g0659100 (OsSPL10) that negatively
    regulates the salt tolerance [43] was up-regulated in the salt-sensitive S3 but
    showed the lowest and non-significant expression in salt-tolerant S13. Growth-regulating
    factor interacting factor 1 Os03g0733600 (OsGIF1) gene was up-regulated in both
    genotypes under salt stress, however, an increased relative expression was noticed
    in the tolerant genotype. Furthermore, four genes including similar to Globulin
    1 expressed protein Os08g0127900 (OsEnS-115), U-box E3ubiquitin ligase Os01g0823900
    (OsPUB3), 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase, Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense
    signaling Os02g0559400 (OsOPR8), CBL-interacting protein kinase 5 Os01g0206700
    (OsCIPK5) were up-regulated in salt-tolerant genotype and down-regulated in salt-sensitive
    genotype. Fig. 6 Validation of RNA-seq results with Real-time qPCR using six genes.
    The results show the relative expression of six genes in both S3 and S13 genotypes
    under control and salt-stressed conditions. Data is represented by mean ± SD Full
    size image Discussion Plants have a number of tolerance and adaptive mechanisms
    at the biochemical and physiological levels to withstand salt stress [46]. Transcriptomics
    can help in revealing changes in the expression of genes at the whole-genome level
    which can aid in comprehending the complicated gene networks that are involved
    in plants’ adaptability to various stresses [16]. To identify these tolerance
    mechanisms, we have compared the two GSR genotypes with varying tolerance to salt
    stress at the seedling stage using RNA sequencing. In our findings, a total of
    9018 DEGs have been identified in four sets: S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S13-ctrl vs.
    S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl after 12 days of salt
    stress. These DEGs were identified using DESeq2 in R with screening thresholds
    of |log2FC| ≥ 2 or ≤ − 2 and adjusted P value < 0.05. Out of 9,018 DEGs, 44.16%
    were expressed in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, 38.40% in S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, 10.83%
    in S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and 6.61% in S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl. Whereas 53.05% of
    genes were up-regulated and 46.95% were down-regulated, confirming the gene expression
    level change in rice root tissues due to salt exposure. Our results showed more
    up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs in salt susceptible genotype S3 than in salt-tolerant
    genotype S13. These findings are in accordance with Formentin et al. [47]. The
    gene set enrichment analysis has identified genes enriched in cellular, biological,
    and molecular processes in both genotypes such as metabolic processes, biosynthesis,
    response to hormones, stimuli, stress, transport activity, binding activity, catalytic
    activity, cytoplasm, membrane and non-membrane bounded organelles, and cellular
    anatomical entity in both genotypes. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated
    genes expressed in both genotypes has identified biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
    phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction as enriched
    pathways. The data shows that many significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways
    were consistent between the two genotypes and that indicates both salt-susceptible
    and salt-tolerant genotypes have a common salt stress adaptability mechanism.
    However, some down-regulated genes in salt susceptible S3 were also enriched in
    the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites while no same pattern was observed in
    salt-tolerant S13. Previously, it has been reported that salt stress regulates
    the same metabolic pathways in both sensitive and tolerant species, with the primary
    quantitative difference [48]. In our present study, we have identified 46 DEGs
    related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and 15 DEGs that are involved in α − linolenic
    acid metabolism. Under abiotic stress conditions, plants produce more flavonoids
    and polyphenols such as phenolic acids to cope with fluctuating environments [49,
    50]. During abiotic stresses of heavy metals, salt, cold, drought, UV radiations,
    and heat the polyphenol biosynthesis mechanism is activated which accumulates
    different phenolic compounds that scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species [51].
    In this study, our data showed that various DEGs in both salt-susceptible S3 and
    salt-tolerant S13 were enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
    Alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway- plant, Plant hormone
    signal transduction pathways, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Cutin, suberine, and
    wax biosynthesis, flavonoids, and polyphenols biosynthesis, and peroxisomes which
    implies the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a significant mechanism
    to withstand salt stress in rice. ROS is generated under high salt concentrations
    and scavenging these ROS helps plants adapt to salt stress [52]. Hence, our data
    emphasized that the accumulation of various metabolites under salt stress and
    the biosynthesis and metabolic pathways that involve these various metabolites
    may contribute to increasing the tolerance and adaptability of rice. In our transcriptome
    data, a total of 432 transcription factors (TFs) were differentially expressed.
    Differentially expressed TFs included 41 families of TFs out of which significant
    classes were bHLH, ERF, NAC, WRKY, and MYB, which suggest the major contribution
    of these TFs in salt tolerance in rice. Up-regulation of MYB, WRKY, NAC, and bHLH
    transcription factors is related to increased production of jasmonic acid (JA)
    phytohormone [53]. Surprisingly, the number of differentially expressed TFs in
    salt susceptible S3 was higher than in the salt-tolerant S13. The difference in
    the number of differentially expressed TFs in these genotypes is due to slightly
    different mechanisms of these TFs in salt stress. The greater number of differentially
    expressed TFs suggests that these TFs might help salt-sensitive S3 of GSR to overcome
    the salt stress. Furthermore, the differential expression of TFs belonging to
    the same family implies that different TF members of the same family may have
    different functions to perform in rice response to salt stress. The bHLH genes
    contribute significantly towards the improvement of salt adaptability and are
    implicated in tolerance to salt stress harm [54]. A total of 42 bHLH TFs were
    differentially expressed in our transcriptome data under salt stress. The bHLH
    TFs are shown to be involved in responses to salt, drought, cold, harmful metals,
    and nutrient deficiencies [55]. These TFs regulate the changes in transcriptional
    expression by binding to the stress-related genes at the promoter region. Moreover,
    flavonoid biosynthesis is induced under changing environments and is regulated
    by bHLH TFs in response to abiotic stresses [56, 57]. We have identified 1806
    novel genes in our RNA-seq results. Out of these 1806 novel genes, 391 genes were
    involved in signal transduction mechanisms. This suggests that a significant number
    of genes involved in signaling processes are expressed under salt stress. Signal
    transduction mechanisms under salt stress activate multiple signaling pathways
    which enable plants to survive under salt stress [58]. Future research is required
    to understand the mechanism or functions of these genes through different molecular
    techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9. Conclusion In conclusion, we conducted comparative
    transcriptome analyses to investigate the salt tolerance and adaptability mechanism
    between salt-susceptible and -tolerant genotypes of Green Super Rice (GSR). Results
    indicated that the tolerance and coping mechanism of both genotypes after 12 days
    of stress is not significantly vary even though both genotypes have varying tolerance
    to salt stress. To better investigate the link between salt stress responses and
    gene expression we suggest the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing and gene editing
    technologies like CRISPR-Cas9. Our findings suggest the efficiency of GSR genotypes
    to survive in salt stress conditions. Importantly, findings of this study have
    provided numerous novel genes (1806 DEGs) that are involved in metabolite synthesis
    and metabolism that can be used in breeding salt-tolerant rice varieties. Identified
    novel genes in the present study will be functionally characterized which help
    to understand further genetic mechanism underlying the salt tolerant genotype.
    Further, utilizing these genes in breeding programs will help to develop the salt-resistant
    rice varieties. Data availability The RNA-seq dataset generated and analyzed in
    the present study is submitted in NCBI GEO under the accession GSE210952. References

  description: Over the last few years, most of greenhouses have been managed traditionally
    based on manpower to monitor and maintain the plants, such as watering, fertilizing,
    and using their skill in detecting plant diseases. Thus, this study focuses on
    developing a greenhouse monitoring system by using IoT technology. It aims to
    assist the local farmers in monitoring their greenhouse, instead of applying the
    conventional methods that are tedious and required more labour works. For data
    collection, parameters for chilli plants are measured using temperature and humidity
    sensors, soil moisture sensor, and light dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The
    data are sent to microcontroller and transferred to the Ubidots cloud for the
    monitoring purpose. Watering pump and exhaust fan can be activated to control
    the plant parameters so that the plant remains in its normal condition. The sensor
    data are processed through classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
    analyse the plant condition, whether the proposed method is suitable or not for
    the chilli plant to grow. Overall, a mini greenhouse prototype for chilli plant
    has been successfully constructed with a system interface on Ubidots dashboard
    to monitor the condition of the greenhouse plant. Results show that the developed
    system can be an alternative in monitoring the greenhouse condition with accuracy
    of 94.5%.

  description: Monitoring water demand is extremely helpful in the early detection
    of issues and malfunctions in water distribution networks. Therefore, distinguishing
    abnormal water meter readings is an important problem in the management process.
    Although much focus has been given to this problem in the last few years, many
    of the approaches still lack efficiency and scalability when adapted to (near)
    real-time settings. To tackle these issues, we propose the Online Curvature Matcher,
    a real-time algorithm for the detection of pipe burst events in flow readings
    of District Metering Areas (DMA), which requires only a few weeks of data clean
    of burst events. In the proposed methodology, libraries of segments of the time
    series are constructed and then used to find abnormal patterns in consumption.
    We also propose the incorporation of additional constraints to address the complexities
    of real-world data (such as the existence of irrigation events, seasonal changes,
    and discrepancies in behavior due to weekday). We perform widespread testing on
    data from 32 DMA. The results indicate an increase in detected bursts compared
    to the state-of-the-art, while a decrease in the number of generated false positive
    events was achieved. Additionally, it was found that six weeks of history is the
    minimum amount of data necessary to perform online burst detection, while Dynamic
    Time Warping (DTW) is a suitable distance metric to measure the similarity between
    different flow reading segments.

  description: Globally, the soils underlying managed grasslands are an important
    reservoir of carbon (C), with the management of the land strongly influencing
    whether the soils gain, lose or maintain C. Further, improved grassland management,
    such as rotational grazing and increased sward diversity, are widely promoted
    to increase soil C sequestration despite limited evidence. Using data from New
    Zealand's grazed dairy grasslands, we examined the effect of management practices
    on C stocks through measurement of the net ecosystem C balance (NECB) across 68
    site-years. Management practices tested included year-round rotational grazing,
    differing pasture sward composition, irrigation, periodic supplemental feed cropping
    and pasture renewal. Excluding years where supplemental feed cropping occurred,
    the mean (±95% confidence interval) NECB was −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1 (65 site-years;
    the negative value represents C loss), indicating the soil C stocks of these ecosystems
    were likely near steady-state. The processes of pasture renewal and the transition
    between pasture and crops resulted in reduced C inputs from photosynthesis of
    between −232 and −94 g C m−2. This reduced C input was partially overcome with
    the application of effluent or manure at the time of cultivation where applied.
    There was no difference in NECB between irrigated (−26 ± 114 g C m−2 y−1) and
    non-irrigated (−19 ± 198 g C m−2 y−1) pastures. In general, conventional ryegrass/white
    clover pastures were more beneficial for C stocks than alternative pasture species
    and mixes. Periodic cropping for supplemental feed resulted in C losses, with
    the magnitude depending on crop type and management, although data were limited
    to three site-years.

  description: 'Rationale: Increased aridity has led to drought-induced mortality
    or loss of health for many tree species. Of particular interest is to explore
    the response of the Mediterranean tree species cork oak (Quercus suber) to this
    declining phenomenon due to its severity and its large implications for the local
    economy and the provision of highly relevant ecosystem services. Approach: To
    assess geographical variations in the response to water stress, we analyzed under
    controlled conditions the effects of four watering levels and the resistance to
    a terminal drought on seedlings collected from nine populations covering the complete
    latitudinal distribution of the species. We explored the response of a number
    of physiological traits and markers of oxidative stress potentially related with
    drought-resistance. Findings: We found a highly plastic phenotypic response of
    most variables to water availability and a large influence of seedlings provenance
    in the drought-resistance strategies. Although the oxidative stress enzymes ruled
    out differential water stress throughout the distribution range, we found that
    seedlings from the southern limit are less vulnerable to drought than other populations.
    Southern seedlings adapted to xeric conditions displayed a larger sensitivity

    • Increased drought threatens tree populations and related ecosystem services.
    • We assess the physiological response of seedlings to different drought intensities.
    • We test the prevalence of local adaptations throughout Q. suber distribution
    range. • Southern plants showed a better stomatal control and a higher water use
    efficiency. • Q. suber relies on its physiological plasticity to overcome increased
    drought. Abstract Rationale Increased aridity has led to drought-induced mortality
    or loss of health for many tree species. Of particular interest is to explore
    the response of the Mediterranean tree species cork oak (Quercus suber) to this
    declining phenomenon due to its severity and its large implications for the local
    economy and the provision of highly relevant ecosystem services. Approach To assess
    geographical variations in the response to water stress, we analyzed under controlled
    conditions the effects of four watering levels and the resistance to a terminal
    drought on seedlings collected from nine populations covering the complete latitudinal
    distribution of the species. We explored the response of a number of physiological
    traits and markers of oxidative stress potentially related with drought-resistance.
    Findings We found a highly plastic phenotypic response of most variables to water
    availability and a large influence of seedlings provenance in the drought-resistance
    strategies. Although the oxidative stress enzymes ruled out differential water
    stress throughout the distribution range, we found that seedlings from the southern
    limit are less vulnerable to drought than other populations. Southern seedlings
    adapted to xeric conditions displayed a larger sensitivity of stomata to changes
    in soil humidity and a higher water use efficiency. These physiological local
    adaptations coupled with larger acorn size in the southern populations, resulted
    in larger aboveground biomass and higher drought resistance at the southern distribution
    edge. Conclusions Our data suggest that this evergreen tree species relies on
    its physiological plasticity to develop adaptative features that allows it to
    overcome water shortage and that southern populations hold genetic diversity that
    could improve the specie´s adaptation in the forecasted drought context with relevant
    implications for conservation programs. Previous article in issue Next article

    traitsClimate changePhenotypic plasticity Introduction A broad knowledge of the
    ecological and geographical range of organisms is becoming increasingly important
    to promote effective planning and decision making for conservation and natural
    resource management. Such a task is especially pertinent in the ongoing climate
    change context due to the numerous and relevant harmful consequences of this phenomenon
    on Earth (Alberto et al., 2013; Keenan et al., 2011). Climate change is not only
    modifying the environments in which all living beings develop, but it is also
    projected to affect their global distribution patterns (Rubenstein et al., 2023).
    Changes in the species distribution range have the potential to reshape ecological
    communities, impact ecosystem services and functioning, disturb human health and
    well-being, and even have feedback effects on climate (Jing et al., 2022; Weiskopf
    et al., 2020). Therefore, disentangling how species are shifting as a function
    of climate change is key for meaningfully managing species and ecosystems. Whether
    abrupt changes in their geographical range will actually occur, however, depends
    on the extent to which these species are able to tolerate environmental modifications.
    In most terrestrial biomes, trees are deemed to be keystone species as they support
    the survival of numerous multiple taxons and provide a broad spectrum of ecosystem
    services, with crucial feedbacks on biotic and abiotic factors(Díaz et al., 2007).
    Thus, the way in which trees respond to changes in climate has the potential to
    largely affect the delicate balance ruling ecosystem functioning (Cramer et al.,
    2001). A major current challenge for the research community is to depict the framework
    of such selective pressure over time as accurately as possible in sessile species
    like trees, which have a limited migration capacity. Plant species have developed
    two main mechanisms to cope with environmental changes (Pérez-Ramos et al., 2013).
    On the one hand, local adaptations occur when a population evolves through a natural
    selection process responding to specific ecological conditions (Ducousso et al.,
    1996), being climate the most pressing factor causing population differentiation
    (Méndez-Cea et al., 2023; Saxe et al., 2001). On the other hand, plants can also
    deal with these new conditions through phenotypic plasticity, which is the range
    of phenotypes that a single genotype can express as a function of its environment
    (Chevin et al., 2013; Nicotra and Davidson, 2010; Reed and Frankham, 2001). Identifying
    responses to ecosystem variations will require a deep understanding of the environmental
    changes induced in the phenotype for a given plant species or population. Although
    phenotypic plasticity was used to be regarded as noise, we currently know that
    it is genetically controlled, heritable and of potential relevance to species''
    evolution (Bradshaw, 2006; Lande, 2009). Gaining an improved understanding of
    how plant species can take advantage of these two mechanisms will be crucial for
    predicting changes in species distributions, community composition and tree productivity
    under future climate change scenarios. Natural differences in functional traits
    throughout the species distribution range can be selectively fixed by local environmental
    conditions. Thus, site-specific characteristics can drive the selection of given
    functional trait values that benefit tree performance in such an environment,
    giving rise to local adaptations. The Mediterranean biome has been widely acknowledged
    as a prominent hotspot of biodiversity (Myers et al., 2000), but also of vulnerability
    (Ochoa-Hueso et al., 2017). The Mediterranean basin is one of the European regions
    projected to be most impacted by climate change, with precipitation expected to
    decrease while temperature will rise causing an overall shortage in water availability
    as a result of increased evapotranspiration (Masson-Delmotte, 2021). Further,
    a higher frequency and severity of extreme droughts has been forecasted, especially
    during the summer season (Masson-Delmotte, 2021). These changes will imply strong
    consequences for Mediterranean forests and ecosystems (Martínez-Vilalta et al.,
    2012; Matías et al., 2019b; Vitale et al., 2012), as drought-related mortality
    has been found to be an emerging widespread event with critical implications for
    forest conservation (Hartmann et al., 2018). If these changes are as abrupt as
    projected, plant populations climatic boundaries may move faster than forest tree
    species can migrate (Higgins and Harte, 2006). Thus, the survival of forest tree
    species will depend in the short term on evolutionary change (Etterson and Shaw,
    2001) through their phenotypic plasticity and their intra-specific genetic variation
    for adaptive traits (Marchin et al., 2008). For these reasons, great attention
    is being paid to disentangle the range dynamics of tree species, their forecasted
    patterns and adaptive functional traits in the Mediterranean region (Matías et
    al., 2019b; Morillas et al., 2023). Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is an iconic evergreen
    tree species typical of forest landscapes in the western coast of the Iberian
    Peninsula and at the north of Morocco. These forests not only hold a rich biodiversity
    and drive extensive and relevant ecological processes (e. g. carbon storage, water
    retention, nutrient cycling, soil conservation…), but they also have an important
    role in the local economy for many Mediterranean countries by the production of
    a renewable resource as cork (Ibáñez et al., 2014; Marras et al., 2014; Petroselli
    et al., 2013). Considering its significant implications for biodiversity, provision
    of ecosystem services and socio-economic interests, together with the alarming
    declining trends that this species is currently suffering (Catalão et al., 2022;
    Dorado et al., 2023; Matías et al., 2019a), it is of paramount importance to understand
    the potential scenarios that cork oak will face in the near future to address
    conservation and restoration programs (Beaumont et al., 2007; Keenan et al., 2011).
    Despite cork oak is well adapted to water stress conditions through drought-adapted
    morphological traits (Morillas et al., 2023) and the activation of several physiological
    mechanisms to limit water evaporation (Lobo-do-Vale et al., 2023; Mediavilla et
    al., 2019), soil moisture seems to be the main constraining factor determining
    its geographical distribution. Previous research in common gardens proved that
    different cork oak populations across the distribution range display large variation
    in growth, morphological traits and survival (Gandour et al., 2007; Matías et
    al., 2019b; Morillas et al., 2023; Ramírez-Valiente et al., 2014, 2010). Adaptation
    to contrasting water availabilities has been proposed as the major mechanism responsible
    for the differences found in functional traits among populations (Matías et al.,
    2019b; Morillas et al., 2023). In Mediterranean environments, soil water availability
    is the most constraining factor determining plant species growth, reproduction,
    and survival (Gulías et al., 2002). Thus, tree fitness in these areas is largely
    affected by physiological traits controlling water loss such as the efficiency
    in the use of water (WUE) and the capacity of water transport through stomata
    (GSW), but also physiological traits involved in carbon uptake such as the maximum
    capacity to fix carbon (Amax). Besides, a combination of intracellular chemical
    reactions are also part of the plant''s response to water stress (Porth et al.,
    2005). Given their important role, some of these traits have been suggested to
    have an adaptive value for cork oak under water stress (Matías et al., 2019b)
    and can be expected to be under selection in a water shortage context. However,
    the physiological and chemical responses of cork oaks to the forecasted increased
    drought are far from being fully understood. The aim of this research was to explore
    the role of a number of physiological traits and markers of oxidative stress potentially
    involved in cork oak''s drought resistance and their prevalence in natural populations
    located along the cork oak´s latitudinal distribution. Namely, we quantified the
    functional responses of cork oak seedlings to the effect of increasingly severe
    levels of experimental drought and their resistance ability to a terminal drought.
    For this purpose, a controlled-conditions experiment was performed using acorns
    collected from nine populations of cork oak encompassing the complete latitudinal
    distribution of the species. The emerging seedlings were subjected to four different
    levels of water availability and following this phase, a terminal drought period
    was imposed. This approach allowed us to pinpoint the most vulnerable populations
    to water stress with implications for planning management strategies under a climate
    change context. We hypothesized that (i) Differences in water availability during
    the growing season will modulate the carbon uptake capacity and water use efficiency
    of cork oak seedlings, resulting in differential markers of oxidative stress.
    We also predicted that (ii) populations located in drier areas will display higher
    efficiency in the use of water during the growing period. Lastly, we projected
    that (iii) cork oak populations located near the southern limit of the species’
    distribution range will have developed physiological local adaptations to water
    shortage, making them less vulnerable to our experimental terminal drought compared
    to populations located in the central or northern parts of the distribution. Materials
    and methods Focal species and study sites Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is an emblematic
    evergreen tree species widely distributed in the Mediterranean biome, chosen as
    focal species for this study. To explore the role of local adaptations to drought
    conditions through the cork oak´s distribution range, we selected nine populations
    along its latitudinal distribution gradient separated approximately 1° in latitude
    (Fig. 1, Table A.1). In November-December 2020 and following the natural ripening
    period of the species across its distribution range, we randomly selected five
    trees per population, with a minimum separation among them of 50 m, to account
    for the spatial variability of the sampling area. Fifty mature acorns per tree
    were collected, their viability was tested by the flotation method following Gribko
    (1995) and viable acorns were stored in wet vermiculite at 5 °C until sowing.

    location of the source populations is indicated by black dots: ARN, ALF, VAL,
    MER, CAL, HIN, ALC, Cha and TAZ, sorted out from north to south, being ARN and
    TAZ the northern and southern most populations, respectively. Distribution data
    obtained from Caudullo et al. (2017). Experimental design The experiment was performed
    at the greenhouse facilities of the University of Seville (CITIUS II), located
    at the city of Seville (Spain; 37°21′31″N 5°59′13″W) from January to September
    2021. Temperature was stable throughout the experiment (25 °C in the day and 15
    °C at night) and light conditions mimicked the forest understory (PAR 516.7 μmol
    m − 2 s − 1 ± 50.13) with natural daily duration. The experiment covered the first
    spring and summer of life of tree seedlings, the most critical stage in the ontogeny
    of Mediterranean woody species (Mendoza et al., 2009). In January 2021, 360 tubular
    pots (15 cm in diameter and 20 cm height) were filled with a peat and river sand
    mixture (proportion 3:1 per volume) to allow a non-limiting nutrient availability
    and adequate drainage conditions. One individual acorn was sown per pot at 2 cm
    depth, 8 pots per mother tree, making a total of 40 pots per latitudinal population.
    To allow natural mycorrhization, all pots were watered with 300 ml of a soil microbial
    inoculum obtained from the maceration of 10 kg of soil collected under the canopy
    of natural Q. suber adult trees on 100 l of water for 48 h (Matías and Jump, 2014).
    This soil was collected from Doñana National Park (SW Spain), a central population
    to the latitudinal gradient of distribution, and was analyzed to assure the absence
    of the soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi (Sánchez et al., 2002). All
    pots were weekly irrigated at 100 % of soil water holding capacity (WHC, estimated
    as the amount of water (g) that the substrate held following water saturation)
    until 80 % of the seedlings emerged, which occurred after 13 weeks (April 2021).
    After this initial experimental phase under optimal conditions, we simulated four
    different watering scenarios, each of them with 10 replicates: 1) 100 % of WHC,
    corresponding with a rainy growing season where soils remain wet most of the time,
    simulated through an irrigation until field capacity twice per week; 2) 50 % of
    WHC, simulating average moisture availability conditions in a cork oak forest
    during the spring season (Pérez-Ramos and Marañón, 2012); 3) 25 % of WHC, simulating
    a reduction of approximately 30 % over the previous scenario and according with
    the projections of the A1B scenario for the Mediterranean area at the end of the
    current century (Giorgi and Lionello, 2008); 4) 10 % of WHC, corresponding with
    an infrequently dry spring, an extreme event that is expected to become more usual
    in the coming years (Mildrexler et al., 2018). These watering treatments were
    applied to experimental pots by adding a constant amount of water to all seedlings
    within the same watering level from 12 April to 1 July 2021, simulating the natural
    growing season. Following this differential treatment, watering was completely
    stopped simulating an extreme drought period and seedlings were subjected to a
    progressive drought until death (terminal drought hereafter) to determine seedling
    resistance to extreme drought conditions across provenances and watering levels.
    To determine the effectiveness of the watering treatments, soil moisture was measured
    twice a week using a ML3 Theta Probe soil moisture sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge,
    UK) on the top 10 cm. To avoid the potential effect of small differences in environmental
    conditions, the position of every pot was randomly rotated monthly. Seedling survival
    was weekly monitored until all of them were dead. Analyses of physiological traits,
    markers of oxidative stress and aboveground biomass in response to drought Maximum
    leaf-level photosynthesis capacity (Amax), stomatal conductance (GSW) and ambient
    to leaf CO2 difference (Ca) were measured on three to four individuals per provenance
    and watering treatment combination every fortnight before the onset of the extreme
    drought period (1st of July) and weekly along this period until the number of
    surviving seedlings prevented continuing with these measures. Gas exchange measurements
    were performed in randomly selected, fully expanded leaves by using a LI-6800
    infrared gas-exchange analyzer system (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). These measurements
    took place between 10:00 h and 14:00 h using a multiphase flash fluorometer chamber
    fitted at 400 ppm reference CO2 concentration, 1500 μmol m − 2 s − 1 light-saturating
    photosynthetic photon flux density, block temperature at 25 °C to match ambient
    air temperature, and relative humidity on full scrub. Plant stress at the end
    of the terminal drought was estimated through the analysis of the oxidative stress
    metabolite malondialdehyde (MDA), which is a useful marker of general lipid peroxidation.
    Also, the accumulation of the compatible organic solute proline was quantified.
    For doing this, we selected a random subset of three seedlings per provenance
    and watering treatment combination. The crude extracts for both metabolic determinations
    were obtained grinding 0.1 g of fresh leaves tissue with 2 ml of Ethanol 80 %
    (v/v). The homogenate was soaked at room temperature for 1 hour and finally centrifuged
    at 12,000 rpm for 5 min; the supernatant was used as a crude extract. The level
    of lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring MDA concentration with the thiobarbituric
    acid reactive substances method (Hodges et al., 1999). Proline was quantified
    as described by Pérez-López et al. (2023). Aliquots of 50 μL of ethanolic extract
    were added to 100 μL of reaction mix [ninhydrin 1% (w/v) in acetic acid 60% (v/v),
    ethanol 20% (v/v)] and heated at 95 °C for 20 min. After cooling, the absorbance
    of the reaction was measured at 520 nm. Proline concentration was determined from
    a standard curve. As proline levels were reported on fresh weight, the reduced
    plant relative water content responding to the experimental drought may have underestimated
    its concentration in the high watering treatments. For the analysis of carbon
    (C) and nitrogen (N) content in leaves and the relative abundance of 13C (δ13C),
    5 leaves of eight saplings per provenance and watering treatment combination were
    ground to powder following sapling death as result of the extreme drought period.
    Total carbon and nitrogen as well as the bulk isotopic composition were determined
    in these samples by dry combustion in a Flash 2000 elemental micro-analyzer coupled
    via ConFlo IV interface to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer
    (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Carbon isotopic ratio is reported as part
    per thousand deviations (expressed as δ values) referred to appropriate IAEA standards:
    (A1) where R is the 13C/12C ratio. The standard deviations of δ13C were lower
    than ± 0.05 ‰. The total C and N values were used for the computation of the leaf
    C:N ratio for each experimental treatment and provenance. These variables inform
    about water stress (proline, MDA), the efficiency in the use of water (δ13C),
    plant nutrition status (C:N), the maximum capacity to fix carbon (Amax), the capacity
    of water transport through stomata (GSW) and the ratio between intercellular CO2
    (Ci) and ambient CO2 (Ca) concentration (Ci/Ca). The relevance of the latest variable
    lies in photosynthesis studies that proved that plants do not directly sense ambient
    CO2 in the air (Ca) but rather use intercellular CO2 (Ci) (Landsberg and Sands,
    2011), which makes this index important for photosynthetic research. Following
    the terminal drought, dead seedlings were harvested and separated into stem, leaf
    and root fractions. We weighed the total aboveground biomass (g) corresponding
    to the sum of the shoot and leaf tissues. Data and statistical analysis Variations
    among provenances and water treatments during the experiment in soil moisture,
    photosynthetic rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (GSW) and the ratio of intercellular
    to ambient CO2 (Ci/Ca) were tested using repeated-measures analyses of variance
    (rm-ANOVA) with provenance and watering treatment as between-subject factors and
    time as a within-subject factor. Data were checked for conformity with rm-ANOVA
    assumptions using Shapiro–Wilk normality test and Mauchly''s test of sphericity.
    Normality tests of the residuals by time point indicated that they followed approximately
    a normal distribution. When sphericity could not be ensured, a Greenhouse–Geisser
    correction was applied. Pairwise comparisons were conducted by comparing main
    effects through post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction. To investigate
    interactions among provenances, watering levels and time, data were divided into
    subsets according to different provenances and then were subjected to rm-ANOVA.
    We analysed the effect of geographical provenance and water availability during
    the growing period on seedling physiology by using linear models including provenance,
    watering treatments and their interaction as fixed factors to explore variations
    in proline, MDA, carbon isotopic discrimination levels, leaf C:N and aboveground
    biomass. The Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc)
    was applied to choose the best model, i.e. lower AICc (Burnham and Anderson, 2004).
    The difference in AICc between the best model and the null model is provided by
    ΔAICc. R2 indicates the proportion of variability in the outcome explained by
    the predictors (fixed effects). When data did not follow normality and/or homoscedasticity
    criteria, transformations were performed. When significant interactions between
    provenance and water treatments were detected, the post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons
    for each provenance were conducted to allow for more specific comparison. In the
    cases in which these interactions were not significant, the post-hoc Tukey pairwise
    comparisons were carried out for each variable with the whole dataset. All analyses
    were performed in R statistical software version 4.2.1 (R Development Core Team,
    2022). All values are given as mean ± SE. Results Soil moisture Watering levels
    applied during the experiment resulted in different values of soil moisture across
    treatments, progressively decreasing from 100 to 10 WHC levels during the whole
    treatment application (100 WHC: 26.2 ± 0.13 %; 50 WHC: 16.6 ± 0.09 %; 25 WHC:
    9.9 ± 0.07 %; 10 WHC: 7.0 ± 0.08 %; Table 1). By contrast, we found no differences
    in soil moisture among pots containing seedlings from the different provenances
    (Table 1). Table 1. Results from repeated measurements ANOVA analyses (degree
    of freedom, F-statistics and P-value) explaining variations in soil moisture and
    physiological traits across provenances and watering treatments (WT) measured
    along time (Time). When significant interactions between provenance, water treatments
    and time were found, data were divided into subsets based on provenance and then
    were subjected to repeated measurement ANOVA analyses (see results in Fig. 4).

    drought Seedling photosynthetic performance strongly relied on the seed provenance
    and the water availability during the growing period (Table 1, Figs. 2, 3 and
    A.1a), as both factors were found to be significant for all the physiological
    variables monitored throughout the extreme drought phase of the experiment. Both
    sapling photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were lowest for the southern
    provenances and gradually increased in northern provenances, whereas the opposite
    trend was found for Ci/Ca concentration (Figs. 2a, 3 and A.1a). Rising soil water
    content from 10 to 100 % WHC resulted in progressively increased photosynthetic
    rate and stomatal conductance (Figs. 2b and A.1b) and decreased Ci/Ca concentration
    (Fig. 3). Regardless of the seedling provenance or water availability treatment,
    both photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance dropped over time when subjecting
    seedlings to extreme drought (Figs. 2 and A.1). The contrary evolution was observed
    for Ci/Ca concentration, increasing over time in response to water limitation
    (Fig. 3). Although interactions between time and provenance and time and water
    treatment were detected frequently for these physiological variables, no significant
    interactions between provenance and water treatment were found for any of them
    (Table 1). The triple interaction between time, provenance and watering treatment
    was only detected for Ci/Ca concentration (Table 1), and the analysis of the independent
    subsets showed that water availability yielded differential Ci/Ca concentration
    values for all provenances excepting for two of them (Fig. 3c and 3h, see Tukey
    post hoc test at the figure caption). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    responses and changes in markers of oxidative stress to water availability across
    the distribution range Watering treatments applied during the experiment significantly
    affected all the analyzed functional traits considered in this study, except for
    leaf C:N ratio (Table 2, Table A.1, Table A.2 and Table A.3). Seed provenance
    was also found to be a key factor for most of these variables when responding
    to differential water availability, as it was included in the best model for all
    explored variables excepting for MDA (Table 2, A.3). We found a significant interaction
    between provenance and watering treatment for proline levels (Table 2). Thus,
    the independent analysis of each population revealed that watering availability
    determined proline concentration across provenances with the exception of population
    “ALC”, which was unaffected by water conditions (Tables 2, A.1). Accordingly,
    the treatment 10 % WHC dramatically increased proline concentration for all populations
    excepting “ARN” and “ALC”. Low watering availability consistently yielded increased
    proline, MDA and carbon isotopic discrimination levels (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Seedlings
    from northern provenance displayed more negative values of δ13C compared to those
    with southern provenance (Fig. 5a). It is worth noting that we did not find differences
    between the treatments 50 and 100 % WHC for any of the explored variables (Fig.
    4 and 5). Plants with southern provenance developed higher aboveground biomass
    related to those with northern provenance, whereas high water availability consistently
    resulted in increased aboveground biomass for all provenances (Fig. 6). Table

    bars represent ± SE. Discussion Functional responses to water availability We
    investigated the physiological responses and changes in markers of oxidative stress
    of cork oak to both different water availability levels and to a terminal drought
    to explore the specie´s drought tolerance and its prevalence in natural populations.
    In increasingly arid Mediterranean forests, water is deemed the most constraining
    environmental factor for primary production (Austin et al., 2004). It was therefore
    expected that different levels of water availability during the cork oak seedling´s
    early development would modulate its physiological performance determining the
    carbon uptake capacity and water use efficiency of the seedling and eventually
    resulting in differential markers of oxidative stress. Results of our study fully
    supported our first hypothesis. We found a significant effect of water availability
    for all explored physiological variables (Table 1). Cork oak seedlings displayed
    increasing levels of stomatal inhibition (Figure A. 1. b) and hence a reduction
    in carbon assimilation (Fig. 2b) when subjected to more restrictive water shortage
    (i.e., 25 % and 10 % of water holding capacity). The inclusion of the factor “water
    treatment” in the best linear model for markers of oxidative stress and δ13C (Table
    2) supports the large seedling plasticity to face with differential water availability.
    The highest values of proline and MDA, which levels depend on specific plant responses
    to water stress, were reported under the most restrictive water limitation treatment
    (Fig. 4a and b). Overproduction of these molecules has been previously identified
    as a biochemical process in plants responding to water stress. Proline is an amino
    acid that acts as an osmoprotectant to keep stable levels of water in the cytoplasm
    (Ahmed et al., 2009) and to prevent protein denaturation and cell membrane damage
    by promoting stability in the structure of enzymes and protecting their activity
    (Hessini et al., 2009). Previous work in cork oak observed a negative correlation
    between relative water content and proline accumulation in leaves, suggesting
    that proline amount is directly related to drought stress tolerance (Kwak et al.,
    2011). On the contrary, other authors provided evidence that proline is a good
    stress indicator but not always a good tolerance marker (Hnilickova et al., 2021).
    Intracellular proline also serves as a carbon and nitrogen reserve and, after
    water deficit, the proline catabolism may be essential for the recovery and restoration
    of cell homeostasis (Ashraf and Foolad, 2007; Kwak et al., 2011). The production
    of reactive oxygen species directly damages cell membrane phospholipids and increases
    lipid peroxidation (Zarafshar et al., 2014). Overall, the content of MDA is a
    measure of the degree of lipid peroxidation and is a useful marker of oxidative
    stress (Lima et al., 2002). Our results are supported by previous studies which
    have reported a similar increase in proline and MDA content in plants displaying
    specific responses to water stress (Liu et al., 2011), and in particular in other
    oak species (Cotrozzi et al., 2016; Jafarnia et al., 2018). Drought stress leads
    to an increase of ROS, which activates the antioxidant system to limit ROS accumulation.
    This system includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. Proline can act as
    an effective antioxidant molecule, protecting plants from ROS under water stress
    and reducing the MDA content and its deleterious effects (Szabados & Savouré,
    2010; Hnilickova et al., 2021). It is important to note that the populations with
    the lowest levels of proline (ARN and ALC) showed high MDA content. This result
    suggests that proline plays a key role in reducing the deleterious consequences
    of ROS derivatives caused by water stress in both genotypes. The same pattern
    was found in the carbon isotopic discrimination analyses. The less negative δ13C
    values reported for seedlings subjected to the lowest water availability (Fig.
    5a) indicate a higher capacity to fix carbon per unit of water loss (i.e., a higher
    water use efficiency; Farquhar et al., 1989). This result implies that cork oak
    seedlings are able to modulate their water use efficiency according to climatic
    conditions, buffering the effects of the projected aridity to some extent and
    keep fixing carbon for a longer period, and highlights the natural drought tolerance
    of this species. As leaf nitrogen content positively determines the biochemical
    efficiency of carbon assimilation, the C:N ratio may have been related to the
    assimilation rate achieved for a given stomatal conductance. However, the C:N
    ratio showed no trend with water availability in our study (Fig. 5b). In line
    with this result, previous research did not find a correlation between N mass
    and rainfall for other plant species (Wright et al., 2005) or for cork oaks (Gouveia
    and Freitas, 2009). Even though the watering treatment applied to the seedlings
    produced a homogeneous response through all the explored variables, it is interesting
    to note that differences between saturated soil at 100% and 50% of water holding
    capacity were not found for any physiological traits or markers of oxidative stress
    (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and A.1). This finding supports the notion that cork oaks
    are highly plastic plant species deeply adapted to water-limited environments.
    According to our results, a dramatic reduction in water availability (25% of soil
    water holding capacity) is required to significantly affect the physiology or
    chemical functioning of this drought-tolerant plant species. As expected, aboveground
    growth of cork oak seedlings from all provenances significantly declined when
    exposed to severe water limitations compared with non-stressed seedlings (Fig.
    6). The reduction in plant growth is a frequent response to water shortage as
    a result of restrained photosynthesis (Ghanbary et al., 2017). Differences among
    provenances in drought-resistance strategies Cork oak seedlings exhibited a contrasting
    response to water availability across provenances, which suggested differential
    mechanisms to cope with water shortage throughout the cork oak´s latitudinal distribution.
    It is worth noting that, although “provenance” was included in the best model
    for proline (Table 2), we found no geographical trend (i.e., no differences between
    northern and southern populations). Accordingly, the factor “provenance” was not
    accounted for in the best model for MDA (Table 2). Therefore, our results point
    out that cork oak populations coming from the whole species’ distribution range
    suffered the same level of water stress when subjecting for a common watering
    level, regardless of their provenance. Despite this fact, seedlings from different
    provenance presented differential local adaptations to water shortage. Seedlings
    from northern provenance, historically less constrained by water, displayed lower
    stomatal limitations (Figure A. 1 a) and higher levels of photosynthetic rates
    (Fig. 2a) allowing them to fix carbon for a longer period. However, seedlings
    from the southern edge, adapted to frequent and severe drought, presented higher
    water use efficiency (Fig. 5a) which was ultimately translated into larger biomass
    (Fig. 6). These results support our hypothesis proposing the presence of differential
    physiological local adaptations to water shortage throughout the species’ distribution
    range. Physiological traits values were not consistent throughout the cork oak´s
    distribution range, showing increased performance in northern populations compared
    to southern ones in terms of gas exchange parameters (including photosynthetic
    rate and stomatal conductance, Figs. 2a and A. 1 a). However, a common pattern
    emerged among provenances for these variables, as evidenced for a significant
    decline in all populations when responding to the terminal drought (Figs. 2a and
    A.1 a), whereas Ci/Ca concentration consistently increased regardless the provenance
    (Fig. 3). The gradual decrease of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate
    with increasing water deficit is a characteristic response of plants in general
    and oak species in particular (Cotrozzi et al., 2016; Ghanbary et al., 2017),
    and one of the main physiological strategies to cope with drought. Imposed drought
    effects were most severe for the southernmost populations (ALC, CHA and TAZ),
    with reductions of the stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity of oak
    seedlings reaching negative values (Figs. 2a and A. 1 a). Interestingly, this
    diminished physiological performance of southern populations was noted from the
    emergence phase, even before the application of the watering treatments. Thus,
    southern seedlings showed a conservative strategy for stomata control in response
    to changes in soil water availability in order to reduce transpiration under water
    stress. Stomatal conductance is a main driver of hydraulic changes that determine
    the plant response to environmental stress and is tightly correlated with carbon
    fixation (Flexas et al., 2014). A close relationship between photosynthetic rate
    and stomatal conductance as observed in this study, was reported by other studies
    in Quercus species (Damesin and Rambal, 1995; Peñuelas et al., 1998) and in cork
    oak (Faria et al., 1998). The reduced photosynthetic rate responding to water
    stress could be due to the decrease in stomatal conductance, but also to mesophilic
    changes such as changes in the intercellular CO2 concentration (Cotrozzi et al.,
    2016), finally leading to a reduction in photochemical efficiency of photosystem
    II. The response of photosynthesis to water shortage in Quercus species growing
    under natural conditions has been extensively reported (Damesin and Rambal, 1995;
    Faria et al., 1998; Salleo and Gullo, 1990). Negative photosynthetic values during
    the terminal drought period in the southernmost populations imply that leaf respiration
    predominates over photosynthesis (Gallé et al., 2007) and there is a net carbon
    loss, which would eventually lead to carbon starvation and plant death (McDowell
    et al., 2008). Conversely, we found that seedlings from northern provenance maintained
    positive carbon assimilation when subjected to the same terminal drought, being
    able to keep the carbon gain for a longer period regardless of the water shortage
    (Figs. 2 and A. 1). This result directly relates to the pattern found in our previous
    report, which described how cork oak seedlings from the northern distribution
    range had a higher survival rate compared to those from the south (Morillas et
    al., 2023). Given the paramount importance of water availability for plant performance,
    we expected that cork oak southern populations influenced by drier climate would
    display higher efficiency in the use of water compared to northern populations.
    In agreement with this hypothesis, we found a clear trend towards less negative
    δ13C values in the southern populations (Fig. 5) supported by the inclusion of
    the “provenance” factor in the best linear model for this variable (Table 2).
    This result supports a marked geographical increase in the water use efficiency
    with decreasing latitude across the species’ distribution range. We further found
    that lower water availability yielded less negative δ13C values (Fig. 5). The
    fact that this pattern was consistent across populations implies that seedlings
    from the whole distribution range can modulate their water use efficiency according
    to environmental conditions. Cork oak has been previously acknowledged as a highly
    plastic drought-resistant species, which can display a conservative water use
    (Besson et al., 2014; Grant et al., 2010). The significant increase of δ13C values
    in cork oak leaves towards the most xeric end of our gradient (Fig. 5) suggests
    that this species can largely adjust the gaseous exchange at the leaf level according
    to local water availability. Thus, southern populations of cork oaks may maintain
    carbon assimilation by minimizing water loss through fine-tuned stomatal control
    (Otieno et al., 2007) and by extracting water from deep soil reserves (David et
    al., 2007; Kurz-Besson et al., 2006), resulting in higher water use efficiency.
    These findings concur with our previous report in which we found that the same
    cork oak southern populations analyzed in this study showed a clear trend toward
    maximizing traits related with belowground growth (i.e., root surface area, root
    average diameter and root volume) to increase deep water uptake (Morillas et al.,
    2023). Our findings are in line with previous research relating increased water
    use efficiency values to local aridity for the studied species (Gouveia and Freitas,
    2009) and other tree species (Damesin et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Pérez-Ramos
    et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2003), and imply that not all cork oak populations are
    equally vulnerable to water stress. In this study, we found that cork oak seedlings
    originating from the southern distribution range displayed larger aboveground
    biomass than those from the northern distribution area (Fig. 6). These results
    are in agreement with our previous report in which we identified the larger acorn
    size found in the southern populations as a determining trait influencing cork
    oak seedling growth in this same study area (Morillas et al., 2023). The relevance
    of seed size for seedling growth has been previously acknowledged by large empirical
    evidence (Baraloto et al., 2005; Pérez-Ramos et al., 2010; Ramírez-Valiente et
    al., 2009). Another factor potentially contributing to the differential aboveground
    biomass developed across provenances is the contrasting water use efficiency displayed
    by cork oak populations distributed throughout the species distribution range.
    The positive relationship between water use efficiency and aboveground biomass
    reported in this study would allow seedlings from southern provenance to fix a
    larger amount of carbon per unit of water transpired, which would eventually result
    in larger biomass compared to seedlings from northern provenance. Although most
    of studies exploring the relationship between water use efficiency and aboveground
    growth or biomass in water-limited environments report a positive relationship
    (e.g., Dudley, 1996b, 1996a; Ludwig et al., 2004), some studies yielded neutral
    (Ludwig et al., 2004) or even negative relationships (Donovan et al., 2007). Conclusions
    The results of this research support the presence of a marked geographical gradient
    of physiological adaptations to water stress across the complete latitudinal distribution
    of cork oak. Despite that the analysis of the stress indicator metabolites (proline
    and MDA) ruled out the differential water stress level among northern and southern
    provenances, seedlings from the southern limit seem to be less vulnerable to experimental
    drought compared to populations located in the central or northern parts of the
    distribution. Southern seedlings exhibited local adaptations to water shortage
    such as a higher sensitivity of stomata to changes in soil humidity, adjusting
    a better stomatal control of transpiration in response to drought, which allows
    for a fine-tuned physiological performance. Accordingly, seedlings from the more
    xeric provenance at the southern edge displayed the highest water use efficiency,
    increasing thus their resistance to drought. These physiological adaptations of
    southern-range seedlings to local conditions, along with other morphological traits
    related to drought resistance (i.e., larger acorn size or root investment, Morillas
    et al., 2023), resulted in larger aboveground biomass and higher drought resistance
    at the southern distribution limit (Matías et al., 2019b). Beyond these geographical
    differences, we also found evidence for phenotypic plasticity in terms of physiological
    traits in the response of cork oak seedlings to different levels of water availability.
    Thus, the plasticity of the different cork oak ecotypes, and in particular physiological
    traits, may be used to buffer the response of tree populations under a global
    change scenario, where extreme drought events are expected to increase in severity
    and frequency. Our results suggest that despite the potential impact of increasing
    aridity on the northern most populations, the southern populations may hold genetic
    diversity that would influence the potential of the species to adapt to novel
    conditions. The intraspecific genetic diversity harbored by southern populations
    may provide an important adaptive advantage in response to the forecasted increased
    drought in the Mediterranean Basin. Thus, this ecotype plays an important role
    in terms of biodiversity conservation and features a high potential for restoration
    programs in more xeric environments. Notably, these areas are worthy of deeper
    scientific research and public awareness for preserving cork oak populations from
    extinction. CRediT authorship contribution statement Lourdes Morillas: Writing

  description: Jatiluhur dam, located in West Java province, is one of the most extensive
    reservoirs in Indonesia and is used to secure the water supply for 240,000 ha
    of rice fields to prevent agricultural drought in the downstream Citarum watershed.
    During the last two decades, several areas in the downstream Citarum watershed
    have been experiencing agricultural drought following meteorological drought events.
    This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural drought
    and their correlation with meteorological drought occurrence by utilizing a remote
    sensing image processing technique. The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI)
    and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from MODIS and CHIRPS data
    were used to estimate agricultural and meteorological drought events, respectively.
    The results showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought in the downstream
    Citarum watershed was varied and related to earlier meteorological drought. The
    agricultural drought mainly occurred after a meteorological event with the magnitude
    mostly related to the magnitude of the ONI and DMI. A strong El Nino and positive
    IOD will cause a higher magnitude of agricultural drought. The time lag between
    the two drought occurrences was found to be related to the distance of the paddy
    fields from the main irrigation network and the proximity of the main irrigation
    network to the Jatiluhur Dam spillway.

    • The duration and magnitude of meteorological drought relate to the extent of
    agricultural drought. • Easier or closer the production field to access of irrigation,
    it means the longer time lag between both droughts. • Distribution of agricultural
    drought depends on the path distance of production fields, major irrigation, and
    reservoir. Abstract Jatiluhur dam, located in West Java province, is one of the
    most extensive reservoirs in Indonesia and is used to secure the water supply
    for 240,000 ha of rice fields to prevent agricultural drought in the downstream
    Citarum watershed. During the last two decades, several areas in the downstream
    Citarum watershed have been experiencing agricultural drought following meteorological
    drought events. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural
    drought and their correlation with meteorological drought occurrence by utilizing
    a remote sensing image processing technique. The Normalized Difference Drought
    Index (NDDI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from MODIS and
    CHIRPS data were used to estimate agricultural and meteorological drought events,
    respectively. The results showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought in
    the downstream Citarum watershed was varied and related to earlier meteorological
    drought. The agricultural drought mainly occurred after a meteorological event
    with the magnitude mostly related to the magnitude of the ONI and DMI. A strong
    El Nino and positive IOD will cause a higher magnitude of agricultural drought.
    The time lag between the two drought occurrences was found to be related to the

    rice production continuity in major paddy fields around the world, with the availability
    depending on rainfall and irrigation network (Chauhan et al., 2017). Generally,
    an irrigation network provides water supply more continuously because the water
    source comes from a reservoir or perennial river stream. In contrast, water supply
    from rainfall is usually seasonally dependent. Therefore, it is relatively clear
    that the rain feed paddy field area is sensitive to become drought agriculturally
    due to meteorological drought occurrence (Erythrina et al., 2021; Hossain and
    Fischer, 1995; Hossain et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018; Zeigler and Puckridge,
    1995) whereas for the irrigated paddy field area is assumed less sensitive. However,
    studies by Arifah et al. (2022) and Cho et al. (2021) show that the irrigated
    paddy field area may also become drought agriculturally due to meteorological
    drought related to climate change. This kind of study is still limited and needs
    to be improved for the country that consumes rice as the staple food, such as
    Indonesia, to strengthen food security. An example of an irrigated paddy field
    area in Indonesia that was suspected of having experienced agricultural drought
    occurrence is the downstream Citarum watershed in Java, as shown in Fig. 1. The
    area is served by one of the most extensive reservoirs in Indonesia, the Jatiluhur
    dam, which is expected to maintain the continuity of water supply for the agricultural
    field (DHV et al., 2010), decrease the flood risk and drought in the downstream
    area, as well as also to provide electricity (Ministry Of Public Work Republic
    Of Indonesia, W. R. D., & Deltares, 2010). Water from the reservoir is utilized
    by more than 240,000 ha of paddy fields (Hatmoko et al., 2020), which contribute
    to 17 % of Indonesia''s annual rice production (Firmansyah et al., 2016). Even
    though the reservoir capacity, together with the irrigation network, can be sufficiently
    used to fulfill the water demand of the downstream paddy field area for continuous
    production, some locations do not receive enough water supply, particularly during
    the dry season, thereby leading to the occurrence of agricultural drought (Hatmoko
    and Mulyantari, 2014). The dry season in the area usually occurs from March to
    September, following the monsoonal pattern (Aldrian and Dwi Susanto, 2003a), with
    the driest months found in July, August, and September (Purnama, 2008). This dry
    period may be extended into November due to El Nino and positive IOD (Aldrian,
    2002a). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    satellite image (A), and drainage pattern and administrative regions (B). Agricultural
    drought can be described as a condition of insufficient soil water content in
    the root zone where the percentage is lower than the minimum requirement for a
    plant to grow (Liu et al., 2016a; Rickard, 1960). Generally, agricultural drought
    occurs after the sequence of meteorological and hydrological drought events (Liu
    et al., 2016b). A meteorological drought can be described as a temporary condition
    in which the amount of rainfall in a specific period is decreased compared to
    the average (Wilhite, 1993). The degree of the meteorological drought is determined
    according to the ratio between the amount of precipitation and the quantity considered
    normal for that period (Siswanto et al., 2022). This event usually leads to the
    occurrence of hydrological drought, a condition associated with the decrease in
    surface and groundwater supply, indicated by the significant lowering of the river''s
    water level in the reservoir, lake, and groundwater table (Dai, 2011). According
    to preliminary studies, Java Island was hit by meteorological and hydrological
    drought (D''Arrigo et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2012, 2017), which likely disturbed
    the Jatiluhur dam operation (Hatmoko and Mulyantari, 2014). Agricultural drought
    occurs in most areas of Java Island, including paddy fields (Daruati et al., 2013;
    Erasmi et al., 2009). However, it also occurred in the irrigated paddy fields
    in the study area, as indicated by the significant decrease in rice production
    during the drought period for the last two decades (Hatmoko and Mulyantari, 2014).
    The lost of rice production due to drought events in West Java is reported can
    reach up to 40% (Surmaini et al., 2015). However, the spatiotemporal distribution
    and pattern are still unknown because a detailed report cannot be found from a
    public source. Therefore, this study aims to describe and analyze the spatiotemporal
    patterns of the agricultural drought event in the paddy field located in the downstream
    Citarum watershed. Therefore, a remote sensing approach was used with a dataset
    of the last two decades, considering the limitation of ground-measured data. To
    achieve the aim of this study, the agricultural drought occurrence was approached
    using the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) due to its best accuracy
    (Dobri et al., 2021; Gouveia et al., 2012; Rahmi and Dimyati, 2021; Rhee et al.,
    2010). Furthermore, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset
    was used to monitor the agricultural drought. NDDI and MODIS were used due to
    their temporal resolution sufficiency for paddy field monitoring, the high temporal
    resolution, and continuity in the observation in the last two decades (Kurnia
    Jayanti et al., 2012). The calculated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method
    was derived from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS)
    data (Paredes Trejo et al., 2016). This tool was used to determine the meteorological
    drought event and the best validation result against the ground observation data
    (Shen et al., 2020), respectively. In addition, this study also investigated how
    the existence of the dam irrigation network can shape the spatiotemporal pattern
    of the agriculture drought. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Datasets and pre-processing
    This study used the MODIS dataset acquired between January 2001 and December 2020
    to describe the agricultural drought events. Furthermore, it used the CHIRPS dataset
    acquired between January 1981 and December 2020 to describe the meteorological
    drought events. The MODIS dataset consists of reflectance Band 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared),
    and 7 (mid-infrared) captured from the collection of the Terra-Aqua vegetation
    index 16-day composite 250 m product (MOD/MYD13Q1) v.006 (Saleska et al., 2007)
    together with the related VI quality band. The MODIS dataset was downloaded from
    the NASA''s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Centre (LP DAAC) server.
    It was then processed for geometrical reprojection and subset to adjust the study
    area boundary using MODIStsp (Busetto and Ranghetti, 2016). The CHIRPS dataset
    used in this study was a v.2 global monthly precipitation dataset at a spatial
    resolution of 0.050 × 0.050°, obtained from https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/global_monthly/.
    The CHIRPS dataset was also used as a subset to adjust the boundary of the study
    area. In addition, a dataset of the irrigation network acquired from the Geospatial
    Information Agency (BIG) of the Republic of Indonesia, a Google map, and field
    observation were also used to analyze the relationship between agricultural drought
    occurrence and the Jatiluhur dam service coverage. This study also used a paddy
    field map from the Ministry of Agriculture of The Republic of Indonesia to assess
    the agricultural drought on a particular land cover type. All datasets used in
    this study were observed visually against the reference of the local topographic
    map to determine the geometric consistency and processed geometric correction.
    The temporal variation of the precipitation in the study area is influenced mainly
    by the monsoonal pattern (Aldrian and Dwi Susanto, 2003b). However, the sea surface
    temperature anomaly in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean may also contribute significantly
    (Aldrian, 2002b). The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) from the National Weather Service
    Climate Prediction Centre (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) and Dipole Mode
    Index (DMI) from the Global Climate Observing System (https://psl.noaa.gov/) were
    used to analyze the relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought
    in the study area and the occurrence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
    and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. 2.2. Drought assessment methods
    Drought assessment in this study was carried out in four steps (see Fig. 2). The
    first step was to describe the meteorological drought occurrence using the SPI
    method (McKee et al., 1993) based on the CHIRPS dataset. The SPI was calculated
    using the principle of measuring any possibility of precipitation anomalies at
    a particular time, which was identified based on a long-term historical precipitation
    record. The time can be set for some duration, such as 1 (SPI-1), 3 (SPI-3), 12
    (SPI-12), or 24 (SPI-24) months, which describes the water supply from precipitation
    at those particular periods compared to the historical precipitation data. Deepa
    B. Kamble et al. (2019) stated that the response of paddy plant conditions may
    be affected by a short-term (1 month) meteorological drought, hence the use of
    SPI-1 in this study. This tool helps describe the rules of the irrigation system
    in the study area when meteorological drought is detected. Precipitation data
    is usually not distributed normally but transformed to fit the gamma function.
    The SPI-1 data used was provided based on the study by Siswanto et al. (2022)
    by using the open-source module of Climate and Drought Indices in Python (https://climate-indices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    (Adams, 2017) with the principle of the following equation (Song et al., 2020):
    (1) where X is the monthly precipitation series of n years, t represents the yearly
    index, m is the specific month and s denotes a certain time scale. The prediction
    of meteorological drought based on SPI is determined using Eq. (1) (Svoboda et
    al., 2012). Download : Download high-res image (509KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The graphical flow chart of the methods used in the study. The second
    step was to model the agricultural drought occurrence using the NDDI method (Gu
    et al., 2008) by employing the MODIS dataset and MODIStsp (Busetto and Ranghetti,
    2016). According to preliminary studies, NDDI is an appropriate remote sensing
    image transformation method used for agricultural drought assessment occurrence.
    It examines the process by detecting the greenness and water content on the surface
    of the green vegetation canopy (Gu et al., 2008; Gulácsi and Kovács, 2018), including
    paddy plants (Du et al., 2018). The vegetation canopy''s greenness degree and
    water content are detected using band ratios of the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), respectively. The NDDI
    value for each MODIS pixel, was determined using Eq. (2). (2) where the NDVI and
    NDWI were generated from the MODIS datasets as stated in Eqs. (3), (4)). (3) (4)
    The resulting NDDI computation was then composed into monthly data to match the
    SPI-1 timestep. Furthermore, the dry condition capable of triggering water stress
    for vegetation or agricultural drought occurrence was indicated by the NDDI value
    above 0.5 (Khampeera et al., 2017). The third step is to define the temporal pattern
    of agricultural drought occurrence using results from the first and second steps.
    Three considerations were taken into account when defining agricultural drought
    in this study. First is the meteorological drought occurrence (indicated by using
    SPI-1) together with the ONI and IOD. This consideration was due to the sequence
    of meteorological and agricultural droughts (Liu et al., 2016). Any drought conditions
    detected by the NDDI value without being triggered by meteorological effects in
    advance might indicate a false agricultural drought requiring further analysis.
    Second, the local agricultural office''s information (Ramadhani et al., 2021)
    shows that the harvesting and preparation activities for the new planting season
    may take up to 60 days (approximately two months). The land surface has an NDDI
    value above 0.5 (dry) in this condition. Therefore, an agricultural drought was
    defined when dry conditions based on the NDDI value were found for at least three
    consecutive months. Third, the Quality Assurance (QA) bands of MODIS VI data were
    considered (Didan, 2015) and used to define the confidence of the resulting NDDI
    value. For the sake of simplicity, this study only considered the mixed cloud,
    adjacent cloud, and shadow pixel bands. A lower percentage of the QA pixels indicates
    higher confidence in the NDDI value and vice versa. Furthermore, the temporal
    pattern of agricultural drought occurrence was defined using a graphical boxplot
    of the study area''s monthly SPI-1 and NDDI values and the related QA pixels,
    ONI, and IOD values. The fourth step was to describe the spatial pattern of the
    agricultural drought historical event in the paddy field of the study area based
    on the results from the third step using a series of maps and charts. Furthermore,
    overlay analysis was used to describe the relationship through the time lag between
    the occurrence of agricultural and preceded meteorological drought. It was also
    carried out between the agricultural drought map, with its time lag used to determine
    the related preceding meteorological drought maps and the existing irrigation
    network map. Therefore, this study aims to understand how the irrigation network
    influences the agricultural drought spatiotemporal pattern. The irrigation network
    focused on the path distance from the Jatiluhur dam spillway and the position
    of the sluice gate to the paddy field. Due to data limitations, this study did
    not consider the historical water inflow to and outflow from the dam. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Temporal assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts
    Both types of droughts can occur mostly between June and November following the
    monsoonal dry season. The meteorological drought found during the study period
    can be distinguished into two groups: (a) the first group is indicated by an SPI-1
    value below −1 and occurred for three or more consecutive months in 2003, 2006,
    2015, and 2019, as shown in Fig. 3A; (b) the second group was also indicated by
    an SPI-1 value below −1 but occurred in shorter periods for the rest of the years,
    except in 2004, 2017, and 2020 which showed almost no drought occurrences. The
    first group of meteorological drought occurrences related to the ONI and DMI (Fig.
    3B), where El Nino occurred together with positive IOD. This condition indicates
    a higher magnitude of drought with a further decrease in rainfall amount and intensity
    than normal conditions (D''Arrigo and Smerdon, 2008; Siswanto et al., 2022). Meanwhile,
    the second group of meteorological drought occurrences is closer to the normal
    condition of dry seasons in the study area, which follows the monsoonal pattern
    with the lowest rainfall amounts found from August to October. Some events of
    the second group were affected by a lower magnitude of El Nino together with positive
    IOD, such as those found in 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2018. Download : Download

    meteorological (B) and agricultural (C) drought events are indicated with a violet.
    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the Web version of this article.) Following the meteorological
    drought occurrences, some agricultural drought events were detected by the NDDI
    values above 0.5, as shown in Fig. 3C. One was found after the first group of
    meteorological droughts in 2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019, which mainly occurred with
    a duration of 3–6 consecutive months, commonly between June and November. Furthermore,
    agricultural drought was also found to be associated with the second group of
    meteorological drought occurrences in a shorter period of up to 3 consecutive
    months, commonly between July and September. Some agricultural droughts were also
    detected without the preceding occurrence of meteorological drought (2004 and
    2020) which most probably it is related to the quality of MODIS VI (Fig. 3D).
    The QA bands of MODIS VI data gave an overview of how confident the NDDI value
    derived from MODIS VI data can predict agricultural drought occurrence. The inclusion
    of low-quality MODIS VI data in this study may produce inaccurate information
    (Teodoro et al., 2015). The QA bands summary by means of the annual percentage
    of the coverage of adjacent cloud, mixed cloud, and shadow between 2001 and 2020
    are 21%–34%, 17%–32%, and 11%–19%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3D. The agricultural
    drought occurrence detected in 2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019 seems quite confident,
    with the QA bands coverage close to the minimum percentage, as shown in Fig. 3C
    and D. This condition is also found in other agricultural drought occurrences;
    only the ones in 2002 seem to have higher adjacent cloud coverage, and in 2010,
    2013, 2016, and 2020 to have all three QA bands with a higher annual percentage.
    Regarding the NDDI value distribution in Fig. 3C, the box plot indicates that
    agricultural drought is found to occur every month in a relatively small part
    of the study area for more than 4 months. The relation between the meteorological
    and agricultural drought occurrences in the study area was further analyzed and
    indicated using a graphical scatterplot between the average SPI and NDDI and considering
    Pearson''s correlation coefficient (R) value (see Fig. 4). Both the scatterplot
    and R-value showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought occurrence in the
    study area is strongly related to the degree of meteorological occurrence. The
    detection of agricultural drought in the area was also confirmed with the rice
    production (see Fig. 5). A strong relation of agricultural drought detection using
    NDDI with the decrease of rice production can be seen in 2003 and 2019. A less
    strong signal can be seen in 2006 and 2015, while a weak signal can be seen in
    other year with agricultural drought detected. A less strong signal in 2006 and
    2015 compared to 2003 and 2019 most probably due to different situation of the
    pest strike that common occurred in the dry season (Effendi et al., 2020). In
    addition, drought anticipation from the farmer sides seems better in 2006 and
    2015 by utilized the groundwater source (Setiobudi and Sembiring, 2009). However,
    a comprehensive study of rice production fluctuation seems need a deeper study
    since many factors can be contributed besides drought itself. Download : Download

    results of this study in the context of the temporal pattern showed that agricultural
    drought in the study area mostly occurred after the occurrence of meteorological
    drought. However, the magnitude and duration of the agricultural drought are followed
    by the magnitude and duration of the preceding meteorological drought, which is
    closely related to ENSO and IOD occurrence. The next section describes This finding
    further in spatiotemporal patterns using a series of maps and graphs. 3.2. Spatiotemporal
    assessment of meteorological and agricultural drought The spatiotemporal pattern
    of the agricultural drought occurrences in the study area is shown in Fig. 6.
    In addition, the average duration and the related frequency distribution are illustrated
    in Fig. 7. The agricultural drought that occurred after the first group meteorological
    drought (2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019) mostly covered more than 20% of the study
    area, except in 2003. Fig. 6A shows the occurrence scale of 2006, 2015, and 2019,
    which is comparable with the preceding meteorological drought with SPI-1 indicates
    3 to 6 consecutive dry months, as shown in Fig. 3A. Despite most of the area being
    served by an irrigation system, some are not affordable due to limited access
    to the irrigation network and, hence, still managed as rainfed paddy fields (Mulyono
    and Fanany, 2016). In addition, the first group of meteorological droughts associated
    with El Nino and positive IOD significantly lowered the Jatiluhur dam water stock
    and was followed by a decrease in the irrigation water supply (Boer et al., 2012a;
    D''Arrigo et al., 2011). Meanwhile, the agricultural drought coverage in 2003
    covered far less area than in 2006, 2015, and 2019 because the preceding meteorological
    drought occurred on a smaller magnitude. Download : Download high-res image (692KB)

    Considering other agricultural drought events that occurred after the occurrence
    of the second group of meteorological drought events mostly covered smaller areas
    than ones after the first group (Fig. 6A). However, events of 2008 and 2018 have
    more extensive coverage than those in 2003. This fact is comparable with the magnitude
    of the preceding meteorological drought, as shown in Fig. 3A. This finding is
    confirmed by the previous result studies of Aldrian, 2002a, Aldrian, 2002b, D''Arrigo
    et al. (2006), and D''Arrigo and Smerdon (2008). However, a relatively high coverage
    in 2004 and 2020 is associated with a high percentage of low-quality MODIS VI
    pixels, as shown in Fig. 3D. Therefore, further study needs to be conducted. Considering
    the box plot in Fig. 3C, which indicates that agricultural drought is found to
    occur every month in a relatively small part of the study area and might occur
    for more than 4 months, the related spatial distribution is shown in Fig. 6, Fig.
    7. Most of the area is located in the southwest part of the study area, and the
    other small part is distributed randomly. Initially, the study area was assumed
    to be only covered by paddy fields based on a map from the Ministry of Agriculture
    of The Republic of Indonesia. However, further analysis using high-resolution
    satellite images from Google Earth and information acquired from a field campaign
    in July 2022 revealed that the areas with an NDDI value above 0,5 or experiencing
    agricultural drought for more than 4 months were mostly abandoned land or were
    rice fields that have been converted into built-up areas, such as in the southeast
    that mainly changed into settlements and industrial construction (Widiatmaka et
    al., 2013). Whereas the other randomly distributed suspected agricultural drought
    area was a built-up area constructed to support the new toll road construction
    (Fiqriyati et al., 2022), and some of them were also found as abandoned land.
    Since this situation Therefore, advanced study is required. The extent of agricultural
    drought events follows the magnitude of the preceding meteorological drought based
    on the assessment results. The agricultural drought in the rice field in the study
    area commonly lasts for 3–4 months, as indicated by the NDDI value. The NDDI duration
    for less than 3 months indicates the preparation stage for the new planting season,
    whereas, for those more than 4 months, it is indicated as a non-rice field area.
    The drought area is distributed randomly; however, since the area is served by
    an extensive irrigation system, it is important to see the drought pattern based
    on the existing irrigation network. Therefore, the next section examines the time
    lag between the occurrences of meteorological and agricultural drought events,
    which may indicate the importance of the irrigation system in maintaining the
    continuity of rice production in the area. 3.3. The time lag between agricultural
    and meteorological drought Based on the assessment result, agricultural drought
    in the downstream Citarum watershed area usually occurs after a meteorological
    drought. Therefore, defining the time lag between those two events is important
    for the future anticipation of an irrigated paddy field. The mean time lag between
    meteorological and agricultural drought occurrence distribution in the downstream
    Citarum Watershed from 2001 to 2020 is shown in Fig. 8. The shortest time lag
    between meteorological and agricultural drought (indicated with 0 months), is
    clustered in the southwest part of the area. Download : Download high-res image

    and agricultural drought occurrence distribution in the downstream Citarum Watershed
    during 2001–2020. However, it is no longer known as a paddy field but a built-up
    area due to the extensive land use conversion into commercial utilization and
    settlement in the last few decades (Firman, 1997; Gandharum et al., 2022). Some
    other areas with the same time lag, which are distributed randomly as a relatively
    set of pixels, also experienced the same condition at a smaller scale. Another
    time lag distribution related to the irrigation network and the possibility of
    the existence of rainfed paddy fields (Mulyono and Fanany, 2016), which are difficult
    to be differentiated in the scale of MODIS VI pixel size, are shown in Fig. 8.
    The closer the paddy fields are to the path distance of the water-flowed irrigation
    network, the slower it dries, as shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. This is in line with
    the Boer''s study, stating that the path distance close to the spillway have a
    longer time lag (Boer et al., 2012b). Download : Download high-res image (626KB)

    network and the spillway of the Jatiluhur dam. The time lag between agricultural
    and meteorological drought that occurs in the downstream Citarum watershed area
    varies, mostly due to different access to the water-flowed irrigation network.
    The area close to the water-flowed irrigation network has a longer time lag than
    those further and without access. Furthermore, the path distance of the irrigation
    network from the dam spillway also plays a role, where the further it is, the
    shorter the time lag. The statistical Pearson''s correlation test supports this
    finding despite the statistical value is relatively low (R = −0.178) but still
    indicates the inverse relation. It is probably requiring a detail irrigation network
    map to obtain a more comprehensive relationship, but unfortunately cannot be obtained
    in this study due to data limitation. Therefore, further study is still needed
    to analyze another source of water-flowed irrigation network as the alternative
    to irrigation water, particularly in drought periods, as well as the effectiveness
    and affordability of the existing irrigation network in the area where the time
    lag is relatively short. 4. Conclusion Even though most of the paddy fields in
    the downstream Citarum Watershed are being served by an irrigation network, it
    still experiences agricultural drought in some areas. Therefore, this study assessed
    the agricultural drought occurrence in the area and its relationship with the
    predeceased meteorological drought events based on remote sensing data, namely
    MODIS VI and NDDI for agricultural drought assessment, as well as CHIRPS and SPI-1
    for meteorological drought assessment. The agricultural drought mainly occurred
    after a meteorological event where the magnitude was mostly related to the magnitude
    of the ONI and DMI. A strong El Nino and positive IOD will cause a higher magnitude
    of agricultural drought and vice versa. Some parts of the study area have agricultural
    drought duration for a longer period and are no longer used as paddy fields anymore.
    The distribution of the agricultural drought related to the magnitude and the
    time lag from the earlier meteorological drought depends on three factors. These
    include the path distance of the paddy field, the main irrigation network, and
    the path distance to the closest main irrigation network to the Jatiluhur dam
    spillway. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study were

    systemsSustainability 1. Introduction The impact of climate change on crop irrigation
    and food security is a critical issue that requires attention. As climate patterns
    change, the demand for water by crops is expected to rise, leading to the need
    for adjustments in agricultural practices to maintain sustainable food production.
    The use of supplemental irrigation for traditionally non-irrigated crops is becoming
    more common in response to these changing climate conditions. Climate change is
    expected to have a significant impact on various aspects of agriculture, with
    its influence varying throughout the farming cycle. Therefore, it is important
    to model the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity by considering
    the interconnected physical, technical, and economic factors. This often involves
    using indicators that summarize the environmental factors that farmers consider
    when planning their activities (Dono et al., 2013). Additionally, it would be
    beneficial to mention the potential impact of climate change on the water availability
    for these crops, and how supplementary irrigation can help mitigate the effects
    of water scarcity. This would provide a broader context for the importance of
    the research and its potential implications for agricultural sustainability in
    the face of changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, it would be helpful
    to briefly mention the current methods of irrigation for autumn-winter cereals
    and how they may not be sufficient to meet the water requirements of the crops,
    especially during critical growth stages. This would set the stage for the discussion
    of the need for supplementary irrigation and the potential benefits it can provide
    for crop yields. Overall, by providing a more comprehensive introduction that
    highlights the broader significance of the research and its potential applications
    beyond barley cultivation, the article can effectively engage a wider audience
    and emphasize the relevance of the proposed approach in addressing important agricultural
    challenges (Konapala et al., 2020). Barley (Hordeum vulgar L.) is a versatile
    cereal grain that is well-suited to various environmental conditions, including
    drought, salt, and cold. It has played a vital role in transforming the field
    of agriculture. Barley was one of the earliest crops to be cultivated by humans
    (UnNisa et al., 2022). Over time, dedicated barley breeders have made significant
    advancements in enhancing its qualities, such as improving seed dormancy, seed
    vigor, and resistance to diseases like rusts and scald. These improvements have
    resulted in increased yield per unit of land (Pardo et al., 2022). In addition
    to its agricultural significance, barley offers numerous health benefits and is
    widely utilized in the process of malting. Barley, a prominent cereal crop globally,
    holds the second position in Europe, right after bread wheat. In the world, the
    production of barley reached 48, 941, 020 ha and 145, 623, 914.5 tons. Specifically
    in Iran, the cultivation of barley covered 2,108,193 ha, yielding 2,814,263.68
    tons (FAO, 2021). The quantity of water needed to achieve the highest yield in
    a barley crop is not constant. It varies depending on factors such as temperature,
    relative humidity, wind, and soil moisture, which influence the rate of evaporation
    from the soil and transpiration from the plant. In ideal growing seasons, the
    water requirement can be as low as 320–420 mm. However, during hotter and drier
    years, this requirement may increase to 360–470 mm in order to achieve maximum
    yields (Khan et al., 2010). The crop''s yield is heavily reliant on moisture availability
    during this stage. If there is moisture stress lasting more than a few days, it
    will lead to a decrease in both grain yield and quality. The amount of barley
    to plant in irrigated areas depends on the barley price, available water, and
    irrigation plan. If water is not a limiting factor, the goal is to maximize yield
    by scheduling irrigations to meet the crop''s water needs and prevent stress throughout
    the growing season (Payandeh et al., 2021). This necessitates careful monitoring
    of soil moisture after secondary root development has finished. In order to increase
    production, it is essential to effectively manage irrigation. This entails having
    a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including soil fertility, the
    relationship between soil, water, and plants, the type of crop being grown, the
    crop''s sensitivity to water stress, the different stages of crop growth, the
    availability of water supply, and the impact of climatic conditions such as rainfall,
    temperature, humidity, and net radiation (Morandini et al., 2020). Additionally,
    it is important to consider the capabilities and limitations of the irrigation
    system. A successful and efficient irrigation management strategy should be tailored
    to the specific crop being cultivated. By implementing crop-specific irrigation
    management strategies, water can be utilized effectively to meet the specific
    water requirements of each crop, thereby maximizing water productivity (Jones
    et al., 2012). Increasing the irrigation management root zone from 50 cm to 100
    cm during the late boot growth stage has several benefits. It allows for less
    frequent but larger irrigation volumes, resulting in increased water availability
    for the mature barley roots. The amount of irrigation required to replenish the
    root zone after reaching the allowable depletion soil water level will vary depending
    on soil texture and growth stage (Hassanien et al., 2016). To assess the effectiveness
    of different irrigation schedules, the apparent water productivity index is used.
    This index measures the returns from each drop of irrigation water application
    under various methods and schedules of irrigation. Drip irrigation, specifically
    at 80% of crop evapotranspiration with 80% of the recommended dose of fertilizers,
    is not only economically viable but also offers higher water and energy productivity
    compared to absolute control methods (Khan et al., 2010). The environment and
    irrigation system have a significant impact on energy input, energy output, and
    greenhouse gas emissions. It is reported that drip irrigation has the highest
    energy input (75.59 GJ ha−1), followed by flood irrigation (62.67 GJ ha−1) and
    sprinkler irrigation (49.81 GJ ha−1). In the case of drip irrigation, the primary
    energy-consuming component is polyethylene pipelines, accounting for approximately
    one-third of the total input energy. On the other hand, diesel fuel consumption
    is the main energy consumption factor in furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems,
    accounting for 32.77% and 36.2% of energy consumption, respectively (Jamali et
    al., 2021). In recent decades, the adoption of water-efficient agriculture has
    led to a significant rise in energy usage for irrigation. This surge in energy
    costs has now posed a threat to the sustainability of many irrigation systems.
    Although the energy required for irrigation is only a small portion of the overall
    energy consumption in human activities, it has emerged as a crucial concern for
    the irrigation sector and a vital determinant for ensuring food security (Gillani
    et al., 2010). Around the world, crop irrigation accounts for about 70% of the
    total fresh water supply, with 90% of this irrigation occurring in arid and semi-arid
    regions. Statistics show that irrigation pumps directly consume 23–48% of the
    global agricultural energy consumption, and the continuous rise in energy usage
    in these areas is becoming a significant concern for irrigation availability (Uysal
    and Atiş, 2010). Thus, the objective of this research is to assess the energy
    consumption and environmental consequences of barley production through different
    irrigation systems, utilizing energy audits and life cycle assessment (LCA). This
    examination will offer valuable information regarding the sustainability of the
    irrigation methods and pinpoint areas where energy efficiency and environmental
    effectiveness can be enhanced. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection and
    study area The research took place in the Mahyar plain, which is located in Shahreza
    city in the Isfahan province, Iran. The village of Mahyar is situated at an elevation
    of 1665 m above sea level, with coordinates of 32° 16′ North latitude and 51°
    350 East longitude in relation to the Greenwich meridian (Fig. 1.). Despite experiencing
    drought conditions, the Mahyar plain has a significant amount of land suitable
    for farming. Specifically, 1500 ha are used for growing wheat and 3500 ha are
    dedicated to malting barley cultivation (Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture of Iran,
    2020). The Cochran method, as described in Equation (1) (Cochran, 1977), is used
    to determine the sample size, which is 20 farms. (1) Download : Download high-res

    of the region under investigation in Esfahan Province, Iran. Let''s denote the
    required sample size as n, the number of farms per target population as N, the
    reliability coefficient as z (equal to 1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the estimated
    proportion of an attribute present in the population as p (equal to 0.5), the
    complement of p as q (equal to 0.5), and the permitted error ratio deviation from
    the average population as d (equal to 0.05). 2.2. Description of irrigation systems
    In this study, the effects of three major irrigation methods, namely, flood (FI),
    sprinkler (SI) and drip irrigation (DI) were examined. The traditional forms of
    irrigation, known as flood, surface or gravity irrigation, involves the distribution
    of water over the ground via gravity. Pressurized irrigation, on the other hand,
    can be categorized into rain and DI methods. Rain irrigation involves the use
    of sprinklers to splash water in drops similar to rain, while DI delivers water
    through droppers in drops, irrigating only the area around the plant''s root.
    This makes DI a local irrigation method, unlike rain irrigation, which covers
    the entire field. DI localized approach reduces water consumption and increases
    irrigation efficiency compared to rain irrigation. Water pressure is another distinguishing
    factor between the two methods, with rain irrigation systems requiring more pressure
    than DI systems. In this research, the fixed classic rain irrigation and tubular
    tape DI systems are investigated. 2.3. Energy audit An energy audit is a procedure
    designed to evaluate the energy usage of a system, pinpoint areas of high, due
    to its high and intensive consumption of energy sources, poses significant environmental
    energy consumption, propose solutions, and identify opportunities for reducing
    energy consumption. The agricultural sector challenges such as depletion of resources,
    contribution to global warming, and risks to human health (Kaab et al., 2019a,
    b). Reducing environmental damage is a crucial challenge in the agricultural sector''s
    energy use. The irrigation system heavily relies on energy and water, which are
    essential inputs for both social and economic development (Ghasemi-Mobtaker et
    al., 2020a). Modern irrigation methods in agriculture can be examined from various
    perspectives, but the primary focus is on the significant portion of energy dedicated
    to irrigation systems, which involve extracting water from wells and pumping stations
    for agricultural crop production (Taherzadeh-Shalmaei et al., 2021). Energy equivalences
    are calculated by documenting all inputs used in the production of malting barley,
    including diesel fuel, fertilizers, human labor, agricultural machinery, seed,
    biocides, and electricity. These inputs are both direct and indirect and are recorded
    throughout the growing season. The resulting outputs are barley grain yield and
    straw. Electricity is utilized for pumping water from wells, while agricultural
    machinery is powered by diesel fuel. Table 1 provides the energy coefficients
    for different operations involved in barley production. By analyzing the energy
    inputs in barley cultivation and applying the energy coefficients, energy equivalences
    can be determined. Table 1. Energy coefficients and energy inputs-outputs in various

    which comprises the diesel engine and the wheel-move system. Energy indices including

    2.4. LCA steps LCA, is a systematic and organized method employed to assess the
    ecological repercussions of diverse systems. It is also valuable for comparing
    alternative choices and determining the most advantageous option based on their
    environmental consequences. The LCA procedure entails scrutinizing and appraising
    the complete resources utilized, outputs generated, and environmental impacts
    incurred throughout every phase of a product''s lifespan (Rattanatum et al., 2018).
    LCA is a tool used for environmental management, which evaluates the environmental
    impacts of production services or systems from start to finish. The LCA process
    typically involves four stages: establishing the scope and objective, conducting
    a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis, performing a Life Cycle Impact Assessment
    (LCIA), and interpreting the findings (Peiró et al., 2010). The study employs
    the ReCiPe2016 method, which associates each damage category with a specific path.
    These pathways are dependent on the type of damage, either to humans, ecosystems,
    or resource availability (Huijbregts et al., 2017). The study has identified three
    categories of damage, namely human health, ecosystem, and resource availability.
    The human health category includes respiratory diseases, various types of cancer,
    and malnutrition. The severity of these diseases is evaluated using DALY, which
    considers both premature death and reduced quality of life due to illness. The
    ecosystem damage category covers harm to freshwater, terrestrial, and marine species,
    and the unit of measurement used is species year. Lastly, the study measures the
    damage caused to resource availability by increased extraction costs, and the
    unit of measurement used is United States dollars for the year 2013 (USD 2013)
    (Fernández-Tirado et al., 2016). In Fig. 2, the connections between midpoint impact
    categories, damage pathways, and endpoint areas of production are depicted in
    the ReCiPe 2016 method. The midpoint indicators in this method specifically address
    distinct environmental issues like climate change or acidification. Conversely,
    the endpoint indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall environmental
    impact on three broader levels: human health, biodiversity, and resource scarcity.
    The conversion of midpoint indicators to endpoint indicators facilitates the interpretation
    of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results. However, it is important to note
    that each step of aggregation introduces more uncertainty into the final outcomes.

    2. The correlation between midpoints and endpoints is determined using the ReCiPe2016
    method of LCA. 2.4.1. First step in LCA The initial stage of an LCA investigation
    involves establishing the functional unit, which acts as the foundation for quantifying
    inputs and outputs. In this specific study, the focus is on evaluating the production
    per metric ton of barley. To establish the objective in LCA studies, a strategy
    is implemented, which entails delineating the system boundaries to ascertain the
    extent of the research. The system boundaries are determined based on the study''s
    scope and the information available in the area. The subsequent calculations are
    carried out while taking these boundaries into account (Mouron et al., 2006, Van
    Zutphen and Wijbrans, 2012). In this particular study, the system boundary is
    depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (814KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. System boundary of barley production in Esfahan province,
    Iran. 2.4.2. Second stage in LCA The life cycle impact analysis was conducted
    using Simapro version 9.0.0 software. Once the study''s purpose and scope were
    defined, the LCI implementation in LCA was carried out. The LCI analysis phase
    generally consists of three key sections: collection, calculation, and data allocation.
    Quantitative and qualitative data for each unit within the system boundary were
    collected and recorded in the report. The gathered data could be measured, calculated,
    or estimated (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2015). The study assessed the environmental
    harm caused by the production process of various inputs used in malting barley
    production, known as indirect emissions. These inputs included machinery, diesel
    fuel, chemical fertilizers, manure, biocides, and electricity. Additionally, the
    study considered several categories associated with the direct use of inputs on
    the farm for malting barley production to calculate direct emissions. Data from
    the EcoInvent database were used to calculate these direct emissions (Bartzas
    et al., 2015, Brentrup et al., 2000). Environmental emissions can pose a threat
    to the quality of water, air, and soil. An important source of emissions is the
    utilization of diesel fuel in machinery during different stages. Barley production
    commonly relies on diesel fuel for activities such as spraying and fertilizing
    to protect against pests, fungi, and other harmful elements. On farms, emissions
    are also generated through the use of chemical fertilizers, human labor, and biocides.
    Additionally, the application of manure and chemical fertilizers in barley production
    can directly release heavy metals into the environment (Ahlgren et al., 2013).
    Table 2 shows the coefficients related to the burning of one MJ of diesel fuel,
    while Table 3 exhibits the coefficients associated with the utilization of chemical
    fertilizers, human labor, and biocide application. Furthermore, Table 4 provides
    comprehensive information about the usage of manure and chemical fertilizers.

    In order to align with the other stages of LCA, it is essential for this step
    to be consistent. To effectively accomplish the objectives and scope of the study,
    LCA should be carefully organized to assess the impacts across the entire life
    cycle of the product. The objective of LCIA is to provide additional interpretation
    of the inventory data (Alaphilippe et al., 2013, Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2019).
    The ReCiPe2016 method defines the 17 mid-point impact categories assessed, as
    depicted in Fig. 2. Additionally, this method suggests endpoint categories to
    assess harm to human health, ecosystems, and resources (Huijbregts et al., 2017).
    2.4.4. Fourth step in LCA The final step in product life cycle evaluation is result
    analysis. This includes evaluating the outcomes of previous stages and pinpointing
    the production and consumption stages of barley crop that have the highest and
    lowest negative environmental impacts. Ultimately, conclusions and solutions are
    examined (Sherwani et al., 2010). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Energy use results
    Table 5 and Fig. 4 presents data on the energy consumption for various inputs,
    as well as the energy consumption per hectare for each input. The table is divided
    into two sections, one for the energy used for inputs and the other for the energy
    used for production, which includes barely and straw. According to the table,
    nitrogen fertilizer and electricity are the two factors that contribute the most
    to energy consumption in all three irrigation methods: FI, DI, and SI. The energy
    consumption for nitrogen fertilizer in the FI, DI, and SI methods is 42,991, 45636.60,
    and 41888.67 respectively. Therefore, the SI method is considered the most suitable
    option due to its lower nitrogen fertilizer energy consumption. Additionally,
    when considering electricity consumption, the amounts for the FI, DI, and SI methods
    are 38,712, 27619.20, and 21,964 MJ ha−1 respectively. In terms of electricity
    consumption, the SI method is the most cost effective irrigation method. The research
    findings on the environmental impacts of energy use in wheat tillage systems indicate
    that the total average energy consumption was estimated to be 30,000 MJ ha−1.
    This energy consumption was primarily attributed to fertilizers, diesel fuel,
    water, and seed inputs. Among the different tillage systems studied, the conservation
    tillage system (reduced tillage) demonstrated the highest output-input energy
    ratio and energy productivity. This was followed by the no-tillage system and
    the moldboard plough and combined seeder system (Houshyar and Grundmann, 2017).

    image Fig. 4. Shares of energy sources in malting barley production under different
    irrigation systems. The information depicted in Fig. 4 emphasizes that nitrogen
    chemical fertilizer usage has the most significant influence on energy consumption
    among the three irrigation methods. Electricity consumption closely trails behind.
    Hence, to decrease overall energy usage, it is recommended to reduce the usage
    of nitrogen fertilizer or explore alternative options that require less energy.
    Additionally, it is advisable to conduct research to assess the impact of reduced
    nitrogen fertilizer consumption on production levels, considering factors like
    economics, environment, and community health. The study evaluated energy-environmental
    indicators in various wheat production systems. The findings indicated in Table
    6, that the irrigated conservation tillage system had favorable energy ratio (2.12)
    and energy productivity (0.18 kg MJ−1) compared to conventional irrigated and
    rainfed tillage, as well as conservation rainfed tillage. The consumption of nitrogen
    fertilizer (55%–68%) and diesel fuel (15%–31%) significantly influenced the energy
    consumption across the four wheat cultivation systems (Khalaj et al., 2023). Table

    1.20 1.79 1.70 According to the results presented in Table 6, the SI method ranks
    first, while the DI and FI methods rank second and third, respectively. This ranking
    indicates that the Sprinkler method outperforms the others in terms of energy
    efficiency, yield per unit of energy consumption, energy consumption per unit
    of production, and the difference between output and input energy. In other words,
    the SI method is the most effective irrigation method in terms of energy consumption.
    Therefore, it is recommended to promote the use of the SI method. To support and
    enhance the adoption of this method, the following solutions are proposed. 1.
    Provide operator training to ensure proper implementation of the SI method. 2.
    Offer government support, such as subsidies or grants, to encourage farmers to
    adopt the SI method. 3. Introduce incentive packages for stakeholders who choose
    to use the SI method. 4. Facilitate access to low-interest rate loans for investment
    in SI method equipment. 5. Support manufacturers of SI method equipment to ensure
    availability and affordability. 6. Reduce or exempt taxes for individuals and
    businesses involved in the agricultural and industrial sectors, particularly those
    utilizing the SI method. By implementing these solutions, the adoption and development
    of the SI method can be promoted, leading to increased energy efficiency and productivity
    in irrigation practices. 3.2. LCA results 3.2.1. Analysis of on-farm emissions
    Table 7 presents the discharge of substances into water, air, and soil resulting
    from each of the efficient inputs. The findings indicate that the application
    of fertilizers results in the release of pollutants into the soil and air. Diesel
    fuel is identified as one of the primary contributors to emissions. The Sprinkler
    system emits the most CO2 from diesel fuel, while the DI system has the lowest
    diesel fuel discharge and the highest nitrate emissions. Additionally, the DI
    system is responsible for the highest heavy metal emissions from chemical fertilizers.

    methods on various damage categories are presented in Table 8. The human health
    damage category is calculated as 0.22 DALY in DI, 0.24 DALY in SI, and 0.28 DALY
    in FD. The ecosystem damage category is calculated as 0.0001 for each of the three
    irrigation methods. The results show that FI has the highest physical amount of
    resources damage category with 84.18 USD2013 yield, followed by SI with 55.29
    USD2013 yield, and DI with 54.42 USD2013 yield. Fig. 5 presents the contributions
    of different inputs to the damage categories for the three irrigation systems.
    The results indicate that direct emissions and nitrogen fertilizers have the highest
    contributions to the degradation related to environmental parameters in all three
    irrigation types. The analysis of human health reveals that direct emissions account
    for about 95% of the share in all types. The ecosystem category results illustrate
    that direct emissions account for about 95% of the share. Moreover, the shares
    of nitrogen in human health, ecosystems, and resources are about 4%, 10%, and
    50%, respectively. Nitrogen and electricity are the main hotspots of the resource
    damage category in all irrigation methods, as shown in Fig. 5. In a study about
    environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production using LCA, results
    indicated irrigated barley production has a greater environmental impact than
    rain-fed barley production, but this impact can be reduced through alternative
    practices such as soil conservation tillage and biomass consumption (Houshyar,
    2017). Table 8. Values of the damage assessment per one ton in malting barley

    environmental impact throughout the life cycle of barley production under various
    irrigation systems in the case study, several conclusions can be drawn. 1. The
    study found that the energy consumption varied significantly among different irrigation
    systems. Sprinkler irrigation was found to be the most energy-efficient system,
    followed by DI and FI. This suggests that adopting sprinkler irrigation can lead
    to significant energy savings in barley production. 2. DI was also found to be
    the most water-efficient system, with the highest water use efficiency. This indicates
    that dropping irrigation can effectively reduce water consumption in barley production
    and help conserve water resources. 3. The study observed that greenhouse gas emissions
    were lower in drip irrigation compared to SI and FI systems. This implies that
    drip irrigation can contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing the release
    of greenhouse gases during barley production. 4. The overall environmental impact,
    including water pollution and soil degradation, was found to be lower in drip
    irrigation compared to other irrigation systems. This suggests that adopting drip
    irrigation can help minimize negative environmental consequences associated with
    barley production. 5. Although the study did not directly assess the economic
    viability of different irrigation systems, the findings indicate that adopting
    drip irrigation can lead to cost savings in terms of energy and water consumption.
    This can potentially improve the economic sustainability of barley production.
    In conclusion, the assessment of energy audit and environmental impact throughout
    the life cycle of barley production under various irrigation systems highlights
    the benefits of adopting drip irrigation. DI not only reduces energy and water
    consumption but also minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.
    These findings support the promotion and adoption of DI as a sustainable irrigation
    practice in barley production. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ali Kaab:

    SHARE Abstract The study aims to develop a novel methodology to demonstrate the
    vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and nystagmus by caloric stimulation in an undergraduate
    medical physiology laboratory. The experimental setup involved two sets of electrodes:
    one set positioned laterally to both eyes, and another set positioned vertically
    over either the right or left eye. The caloric method is used to stimulate ears,
    which involves irrigation of warm (44°C) and cold (30°C) water into the ears while
    maintaining a temperature difference of approximately ±7°C from the body temperature.
    The changes in chorioretinal potential were calibrated to angular displacement
    by a two-point calibration method, and angular velocity was derived after taking
    the first-time derivative. The results obtained from the digital data acquisition
    system were compared to the traditional instrument used in our Otorhinolaryngology
    Department [Interacoustics Videonystagmography (VNG) System for hospitals, medical
    grade] for the normal subject’s data. No significant differences in angular velocity
    were noted (P > 0.05). The cold stimuli elicit a more pronounced VOR compared
    to the warm stimuli. It has been consistently observed that the onset of nystagmus
    occurs approximately 20 s after irrigation, reaching its peak intensity between
    45 and 90 s, and gradually diminishing until it ceases after approximately 200
    s. Our developed methodology enables the recording and quantification of nystagmus
    using easily accessible equipment. This study serves the goal of visualizing the
    physiological process of VOR and thereby fulfills the goal of an effective teaching
    tool for demonstrating to undergraduate medical students. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We
    developed a novel methodology to demonstrate and visualize the most common and
    important physiological phenomenon like the vestibulo-ocular reflex as a teaching
    module for undergraduate students. INTRODUCTION The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)
    is an elementary reflex that helps stabilize vision during head movements. It
    is characterized by the compensatory movement of the eyes in the opposite direction,
    with an equal degree and rate. The major pathway for this reflex consists of the
    primary and secondary vestibular neurons, as well as the oculomotor neurons, forming
    a trineuronal arc. The VOR comprises three main components: 1) the peripheral
    sensory apparatus, including the semicircular canals and otolith organs; 2) a
    central processing mechanism; and 3) the motor output involving the eye muscles
    (1). Evaluation of VOR is done clinically using many methods, such as the rapid
    head impulse test or Halmagyi-Curthoys test and the video-head impulse test, which
    are modern tools of assessment. Perhaps the caloric test is the oldest technique
    and is still used clinically for the assessment of VOR. The principle of the caloric
    test is developing an asymmetry of stimuli on both sides of the vestibular system.
    As a result, the thermal gradient across the horizontal canal of each labyrinth
    sets up a convection current in the endolymph of semicircular canals, leading
    to the subsequent movement of the cupula. The hot water irrigation results in
    an ampullopetal flow of endolymph, with bending of the cupula, causing depolarization
    of the hair cells and an increase in the firing activity of the vestibular nerve.
    This increased firing causes stimulation of the vestibular nerve, resulting in
    a fast component of the horizontal nystagmus beating toward the stimulating ear.
    Conversely, cold-water irrigation causes ampullofugal flow of endolymph movement,
    causing hyperpolarization of the hair cells and inhibition of the vestibular nerve,
    resulting in a fast component of the nystagmus beating away from the stimulating
    ear. The caloric difference induces movement in the endolymph and facilitates
    an increased or decreased firing rate of the vestibular nerve based on the side
    toward which rotation is made (2). The neural output of the vestibular apparatus
    is then conveyed to the superior and medial vestibular nuclei in the brainstem
    via the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve. The peripheral projections
    from these vestibular nuclei are to the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and
    VI in the midbrain through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (3). The stimulation
    causes a slow movement of the eyeball, which is immediately interrupted by a fast
    eye movement in the opposite direction. The fast component is due to the caloric
    stimuli discussed earlier. The slow component is due to the correction brought
    about by the parapontine reticular formation, which has its connections from the
    superior colliculus and frontal eye field via fronto-pontine fibers and supplies
    to the abducens nucleus, which in turn brings the eyeball back to normal position.
    This combination of oscillatory to and fro eye movements is known as nystagmus.
    The direction of nystagmus is described by the direction of its fast component.
    Literature was searched, and it was found that digital recording of VOR was mainly
    done using videonystagmography (VNG) (4) and electronystagmography (5). However,
    these require specialized equipment, are expensive, and require trained personnel
    for the same. We have developed a simple protocol using a digital data acquisition
    system available in an undergraduate medical physiology laboratory (Power Lab
    26 T, ADInstruments) to identify the optokinetic movements produced due to stimulation
    by hot and cold water, with the aim of demonstrating the physiological phenomenon
    of VOR in human subjects (Fig. 1). The demonstration of VOR as a physiological
    phenomenon is also an essential part of the undergraduate medical curriculum.
    Previously, it was either demonstrated without recording or the students were
    taken to the Otolaryngology Department to observe the testing being done. The
    methodology developed by us will make it possible to demonstrate VOR to undergraduate
    medical students in physiology laboratories. Figure 1. Vestibulo-ocular reflex

    AND METHODS Subjects Healthy volunteers of 20–40 yr of age, both male and female
    participated in this study. They were free from any significant ear pathologies
    (like perforation, otitis media acute or chronic, or any hearing difficulties)
    and any ongoing systemic comorbidities (like diabetes, hypertension, or neurological
    deficits). A brief history of the current health status was taken and then recording
    was proceeded. Material Required Bed with an inclination of 30°C toward the head
    end; Surface ECG/EMG electrodes and Bio Amp cable; Digital data acquisition system
    (such as PowerLab ADInstruments system); Cold and hot water (±7°C of body temperature);
    Goniometer; Kidney tray; and 50-mL syringe, cotton, and tissue roll. Electrode
    Placement Two sets of electrodes were placed. In the horizontal plane, the positive
    electrode was placed 1 cm lateral to the outer canthus of the right eye, and the
    negative electrode was placed 1 cm lateral to the outer canthus of the left eye.
    In the vertical plane, the positive electrode was placed 1 cm above the left or
    right eyeball, and the negative electrode was placed 1 cm below the same eye.
    The placement of electrodes in horizontal and vertical planes captures the horizontal
    and vertical eye movements, respectively. The ground electrode was placed on the
    mastoid. The placement of electrodes is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2. Electrode placement
    and experimental setup. Download figureDownload PowerPoint  Instrument Calibration
    The subject was placed in Low-Fowler’s position, where the subject was in a reclined
    position with the head end of the bed tilted 30° upward. In this position, the
    horizontal semicircular canal is in the vertical plane, the position of maximum
    sensitivity to a thermal gradient. The electrodes were placed as mentioned above.
    The gaze of the subject was fixed, and the scale (ruler) was placed below the
    eyeball. The center of the pupil was considered as zero and the subject was instructed
    by the experimenter to adduct and abduct the eyeball maximally in the horizontal
    plane. The displacement was noted by the experimenter, and the angular displacement
    of the pupil from the center was measured using a goniometer. The angular displacement
    of the eyeball and potential difference (mV) were calibrated by a two-point calibration
    method as described in the instrument’s manual. The first time derivative of angular
    displacement was taken to note the angular velocity. The vertical electrodes were
    used to check for artifacts such as blinks or any vertical movements of eyeballs
    during the recording. Recording Procedure The temperature of water for hot and
    cold irrigations was 44°C and 30°C, respectively. The water was placed into the
    auditory canal through a 50-mL syringe. It was taken in a 50-mL syringe and injected
    with a flow velocity of 20 mL in 30 s (5 mL in 7.5 s). The irrigation was done
    in the following order: right 44°C, left 44°C, right 30°C, and left 30°C, i.e.,
    from weakest to strongest stimulus (6). There was an interval of 8 min between
    two successive irrigations. The recording was done from the start of irrigation
    and continued for 200 s. The running water was collected in a kidney tray which
    was placed beneath the pinna to avoid spillage. The subject was requested to fix
    their gaze at one point and lie comfortably on the bed. The caloric response started
    within 20 s and reached peak intensity between 45 and 90 s after irrigation. The
    nystagmus slowly declined until it stopped after ∼200 s. RESULTS The recording
    of the cold-water stimuli given in the left ear is shown in Fig. 3. The result
    shows the beating pattern of nystagmus. It showed the difference in stimulus strength.
    The velocity of the nystagmus was comparable between the hot and cold but not
    significant (P > 0.05). The hot stimuli were the weakest and cold stimuli were
    the strongest. The experimental setup, recording, and analysis of the data took
    around 2 h. Figure 3. Representative record of vestibulo-ocular reflex produced
    due to cold water irrigation in the left ear. The record shows the right-beating
    nystagmus. The fast component and slow component are labeled accordingly. Download
    figureDownload PowerPoint  We have also compared our results with the instrument
    used in our Otorhinolaryngology Department [Interacoustics Videonystagmography
    (VNG) System for hospitals, medical grade] for the normal subject’s data. We found
    no significant difference The mean ± SD values when compared to right and left
    hot were 20.087 ± 4.677°/s and compared to right and left cold were 24.566 ± 4.552.
    There was a significant increase in eyeball movement when exposed to both hot
    and cold temperatures when compared to baseline eyeball movement (P < 0.05 in
    both conditions, unpaired t test). The reason for the recordable VOR reflex is
    possible due to an electric dipole formed in a human eye, where the negative potential
    is toward the retina and the positive potential is toward the cornea. This dipole
    of different charges creates a potential difference of 0.4–1 mV. The negative
    charge on the retinal side is acquired by the retinal pigment epithelial layer.
    The potential difference generation is due to an uptake of Cl− from subretinal
    space, across the apical membrane of the retinal pigment epithelial cells. The
    Na+-K+-ATPase pump creates the gradient for Na+ and Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter
    causes Cl− into the retinal cell. This mainly results in an accumulation of Cl−
    inside retinal pigment epithelial cells. Since the basolateral membrane has a
    large Cl− conductance and Cl− accumulated in the retinal pigment epithelial cells
    results in a basolateral negative transepithelial potential. (7, 8). Our recording
    is based on the orientation of corneoretinal potential. When the eyes are fixed
    or stationary, this corneoretinal potential does not change. However, eventually,
    when the eye starts moving in the direction of the sensor, the potential greatly
    increases. When the cornea moves toward any side of the electrode, positive or
    negative, this will lead to corresponding deflection. This deflection is recorded
    and interpreted as the fast and slow component of the eyeball movement. DISCUSSION
    Assessment of students is mainly in the form of Objectively Structured Practical
    Examinations (OSPE) in which students are asked to interpret the graphical data
    and state the underlying physiology and principles. The methodology developed
    by us makes it feasible to visualize, demonstrate, and record, the physiological
    phenomenon of VOR using a digital data acquisition system, which is commonly available
    in undergraduate physiology laboratories. The response to calorimetric stimulation
    can also be quantified as the movement of the eyeball is calibrated. This experiment
    can be expanded for postgraduate teaching by the inclusion of further analysis
    based on the rotational angular velocity of the eyeball (8). Questions (Question

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor, aroma,
    and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany and
    Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical applications
    that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou et al., 2022),
    neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and potential benefits
    for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer prevention, menstrual
    health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016, Akhondzadeh et al., 2010,
    Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness
    and safety for specific medical conditions. It should be used in moderation and
    under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et al., 2011), but its cultivation
    is characterized by substantial manual labor, making it one of the world''s most
    expensive spices. This study addresses a significant research gap in the field,
    focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles et al., 2015) of saffron
    and the critical environmental factors that influence its development. The aim
    is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron production through IoT and
    addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation, which have been relatively
    understudied in existing literature. The two major analytical points are: 1. Optimizing
    Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding the specific environmental
    requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead to improved crop management
    practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open
    Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse cultivation provides more
    precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity,
    leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared to traditional open-field
    methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing research. The five
    major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering, leaf development,
    daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various factors, which
    have been deduced and summarized from different works as below 1.1. Temperature
    Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud growth during the
    first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures, but flowering commenced
    shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005) found optimal floral development
    within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though exceeding 150 days resulted
    in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted the crucial
    role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated that lowering the temperature
    to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions (23–27°C) was essential
    for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported by Wang et al. (2020),
    can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms to abort. Notably,
    their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers at all. Further
    research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations
    on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering followed by flower initiation
    in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached 20°C. Conversely, prolonged
    hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn when temperatures dropped
    to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh et al. (2021) suggests that
    maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C and relative humidity of 65.71%
    for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient flower ontogenesis. However,
    for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019) found that 36 days of incubation
    at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective. Interestingly, both excessive
    and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting period have been linked to decreased
    saffron production and productivity, as noted by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally,
    chilling periods in December and January, with mean aerial temperatures around
    2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful saffron flowering, according to the
    findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light intensity The role of light intensity
    in saffron cultivation remains somewhat enigmatic, particularly its impact on
    daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However, recent research by Chen et al.
    (2024) explored the effects of different light intensities and red/blue light
    combinations on saffron plants. Their findings suggest that a light intensity
    of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be optimal for maximizing stigma yield,
    quality, and nutrient content. On the other hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020)
    indicate that higher light intensities can compromise stigma yield and quality,
    despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge
    obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based saffron system offers unprecedented
    opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation by providing precise environmental
    control, data-driven insights, and adaptive management strategies. This integration
    of technology and scientific understanding holds great promise for advancing saffron
    production efficiency and sustainability in the future. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Technologies used The technologies that have been used in developing the
    prototype after considering all of the parameters are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller
    -The sensors used are the DHT11 and an LDR -Database management is handled using
    Google FireBase -The app environment was set up and developed using ReactJS Other
    technologies used by researchers in the same field have included Arduino UNOs
    which are generally more expensive than the ESP-32. They have also used separate
    air moisture and temperature while we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both
    these sensors as one and helps reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment.
    Each of them is explained in detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems
    on a-chip microcontrollers features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and
    is cost-efficient and less power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa
    LX7 dual-core The Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor,
    or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor, which also has integrated antenna switches,
    power amplifiers, filters,low-noise receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management
    modules. ESP32 used is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (112KB)

    LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor). 2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11
    temperature and humidity sensor consists of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement
    and an 8-bit microprocessor which is used to output the temperature and humidity
    measurements as data which is serialized (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor
    The most common uses for photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors
    (LDR), are expected to discern the presence or absence of light or to gauge the
    power of the light. When the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance reduces
    rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms, hinging on the light intensity. In the dark,
    their resistance is very elevated, often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential
    devices consisting of variable sensitivity depending on the wavelength of the
    input light. Although they are exploited in many applications, other gadgets like
    photodiodes and phototransistors frequently perform this light-sensing function.

    sensor (under implementation) In our current prototype of the IoT-based saffron
    system, we are enhancing its suitability for outdoor cultivation conditions by
    incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition will enable real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter for optimizing saffron cultivation.
    By accurately assessing soil moisture content, our system can dynamically adjust
    irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron plants receive adequate hydration
    while preventing overwatering or drought stress. This proactive approach not only
    enhances plant health and productivity but also promotes water conservation and
    sustainability in saffron farming practices. With the integration of the soil
    moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers with a robust tool for
    efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation in outdoor settings.
    2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored app development
    platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides tools to
    trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and create
    business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using Google
    Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting for up
    to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and Android
    app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with Firebase
    Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users and makes
    it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions. These features
    support email and password authentication, phone authentication, and access to
    Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete identity solution.
    Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free, cross-platform messaging
    app that allows businesses to send and receive messages on iOS, Android, and the
    web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, synchronization
    and storage of data between users can be done instantly between users. When the
    app is offline, it is still available because the device continues to connect
    to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash reporting tool called
    Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve security issues
    that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash analysis, developers
    can focus more on building features for their applications rather than managing
    and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring Tools
    give developers information about the iOS and Android performance of their apps,
    allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing. When application
    performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android apps on multiple
    connected devices in a single operation. They can view results, including screenshots,
    logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS React is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating user interfaces that are
    based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously
    Facebook) and a group of independent programmers and businesses are responsible
    for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation for single-page, mobile,
    or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks like Next.js. React
    is only concerned with state management and presenting that information to the
    DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates the use of extra
    libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality. 2.2. Application
    development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application is to display
    and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help to improve on-field
    work. The designing of the application is done such that it is easy for even a
    layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user experience is made
    by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white space and equal
    margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important for demonstrating
    the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward with our research,
    the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate the application''s
    performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness in practical on-field
    use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React JS, which is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces based on UI components.
    React can be exploited as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
    server-rendered applications The structure of the appis shown in Fig. 3 The application
    is synced with a real-time Firebase database, from which the app gets data simultaneously
    and displays it on its interface. Firebase web APIs (application programming interface)
    are used to communicate between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4

    The app is integrated with the sensors that need to be installed in the field
    and collects live data that the user can access through the app, unlike the existing
    apps that only have static elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data
    and the data that have been collected, the app compares the live data with the
    optimal data and helps farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield.
    This app currently focuses on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help
    farmers predict which crops will be beneficial based on the live conditions of
    the soil and field. This way, production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3.

    3. Experimentation This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment
    is conducted in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped
    with sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture,
    is installed. These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental
    parameters crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured
    to log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization
    algorithms to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions
    based on saffron cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized
    experimental layout with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive
    optimization recommendations generated by the IoT-based system, while control
    groups do not receive any intervention. Throughout a predetermined validation
    period, environmental parameters and saffron growth stages are monitored and recorded.
    Data analysis focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    system in providing monitoring and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results
    suggest that the IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively
    monitors environmental parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations.
    Treatment groups receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron
    growth and development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy
    in enhancing saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the
    advancement of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating
    sustainable production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to
    further refine the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities
    to optimize saffron cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future
    work In the next phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into
    our existing IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition
    aims to automate irrigation by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the
    saffron cultivation plot. Our experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable
    pump, installing it in the cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water
    based on soil moisture sensor readings. We will develop control algorithms to
    activate the pump when soil moisture falls below a predetermined threshold and
    integrate pump control functionalities into our IoT system. Through a series of
    experiments, we will validate the effectiveness of the integrated pump in promoting
    saffron growth and yield compared to manual irrigation methods. By automating
    irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to improve resource efficiency, enhance
    crop quality, and increase saffron productivity. 5. Results and discussions This
    study posits the conceptualization and realization of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    application designed for the surveillance and regulation of pivotal agronomic
    parameters, encompassing variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    and luminance levels. The overarching objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges
    while concurrently augmenting the cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant
    application, characterized by its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors
    the capacity to bolster the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops.
    A salient hallmark of this application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived
    data, thus serving as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers
    for investigative and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently
    adaptable, affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation
    to the cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its
    current purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful
    Luminous intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for
    the optimum range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The
    paramount aim of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural
    methodologies into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious
    economization of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community.
    A plausible extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies
    within a controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    infrastructure systems frameworkChina 1. Introduction Urbanization is fundamental
    for developing countries to realize modernization (Li & Liu, 2019). In urbanization,
    labor outmigration from rural to urban areas has extensively promoted the development
    of rural areas worldwide (Su et al., 2020). At the same time, urbanization is
    a double-edged sword. Although certain countries achieved significant economic
    development through rapid urbanization, they also faced numerous crises because
    of it (Liu et al., 2010). Among these crises, the rapid development of urbanization
    accompanied by rural decline has become a complex problem many developing countries
    are experiencing (Liu et al., 2018). Existing studies have explored the impact
    of urbanization on the economic and social development of rural areas from the
    perspectives of population, resources, infrastructure, and the governance system.
    Many studies have concluded that rural labor outmigration caused by urbanization
    can not only improve farmers’ economic income and human resources, it can also
    promote the reorganization of agricultural resource use patterns and improve production
    efficiency, thus promoting the development of rural areas (Zhang et al., 2018,
    Mochebelele and Winter-Nelson, 2000, Brauw and Rozelle, 2008). In contrast, it
    has been pointed out that in the process of urbanization, the outmigration of
    a large share of the young labor force will aggravate the aging of rural areas,
    hinder the technological progress in rural areas, and aggravate poverty. Moreover,
    it will also weaken the effectiveness of rural governance systems, resulting in
    social governance problems such as the insufficient supply of rural public infrastructure
    and a decline of collective action ability (Wang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2020,
    Wang et al., 2022). Both the phenomena observed in reality and the conclusions
    of research obtained different results of rural development under the impact of
    urbanization. However, existing observations and research have not systematically
    focused on a more critical issue, that is, under the impact of urbanization, why
    can certain rural areas withstand the external impact of urbanization, while others
    cannot and eventually decline? To answer this essential and under-explored question,
    a systematic exploration of the internal interactions of rural areas in the face
    of external shocks is necessary. However, this exploration has not received much
    attention previously. Conducting such an exploration requires to perceive the
    rural area as a social-ecological system with complex internal relationships.
    The rural area is a complex social-ecological system that is linked with ecological
    systems and affected by various social systems (Anderies, 2004). In the rural
    social-ecological system, biophysical conditions, social interactions, and structures
    are interdependent. Individuals invest time and effort in developing various forms
    of physical and institutional infrastructure, which affect natural system functions
    over time (Janssen & Ostrom, 2006). The rural social-ecological system includes
    further interconnected subcomponents: resource systems (e.g., the land system
    and water system), resource units (e.g., land plot and water units), users (e.g.,
    farmers and society), and governance systems (e.g., rules that regulate the usage
    of land and water) (Su et al., 2020). The outcomes of the interactions of these
    subcomponents at the rural social-ecological system level not only influence subsystems
    and their components, but also other social-ecological systems (Janssen & Ostrom,
    2006). According to the existing rural development literature, “rural decline”
    is defined as a significant decrease in income and quality of life related to
    agricultural production and operation, leading to economic depression and deterioration
    in living standards (Li et al., 2019). Meanwhile, the robustness of the rural
    social-ecological system is the result of interactions between internal elements
    of the rural social-ecological system. The robustness of a social-ecological system
    refers to the maintenance of desired system characteristics. For instance, this
    robustness does not induce a transition that causes long-term human suffering
    (Anderies & Janssen, 2004), and it will not lead to a reduction in people’s living
    standards, despite fluctuations in the behavior of its parts or its environment
    (Carlson & Doyle, 2002). From this, it can be seen that a robust social-ecological
    system is one in which residents can uphold their livelihoods and living standards
    in the face of external shocks. Therefore, a social-ecological system that is
    not robust indicates that its inhabitants struggle to maintain their livelihoods
    and living standards when confronted with external shocks. The failure of social-ecological
    systems to maintain their robustness is a typical manifestation of “rural decline”.
    Therefore, our focus is on examining the reasons behind some rural areas demonstrating
    robustness to external shocks while others succumb to decline, examining this
    phenomenon from the perspective of social-ecological system robustness. Meanwhile,
    observing the robustness of the rural social-ecological system under external
    impact can provide a logic and clues for studying specific interaction mechanisms
    within the rural area (Anderies & Janssen, 2004). Studying how the long-term robustness
    of grassland, fishery, surface water, irrigation systems, and other commons can
    be realized under external impact is the main content of research exploring the
    robustness of the rural social-ecological system (Laerhoven et al., 2020). Water
    is crucial for agriculture, particularly in developing regions where agriculture
    constitutes the primary industry. Consequently, the need to provide irrigation
    facilities has, to some extent, shaped the pattern of farmers, leading to the
    formation of clustered villages. These agricultural communities serve not only
    as a means to facilitate collaboration in agricultural production but also as
    platforms for the creation of interest groups that contribute to various aspects
    of daily life. Farmers rely on these groups to provide public goods and services,
    thereby shaping the social culture and order of the village (Do & Nguyen, 2023).
    Agricultural irrigation shapes the production methods, organizational structures,
    behavioral patterns, and social relations within farm households. Thus, the robustness
    of the irrigation system determines the livelihoods and living standards of these
    households. Therefore, in villages where irrigation systems exist, they can serve
    as valuable samples for studying the robustness of rural social-ecological systems
    (Brugere & Lingard, 2003). Based on this, we conducted the present study using
    villages with existing irrigation systems as a representative sample. By introducing
    the coupled infrastructure system(CIS) framework which is suitable for analyzing
    the interactions between internal components of the rural social-ecological system,
    this study takes China’s farmland irrigation commons as the research object and
    discusses the following three specific research questions: (1) What is the mechanism
    with which the internal interaction of the rural social-ecological system copes
    with the impact of urbanization? (2) What are the results of these internal interaction
    mechanisms? (3) How can the robustness of the rural social-ecological system be
    ensured in the face of external shocks? To address these three research questions,
    in this paper, the internal interaction process of the irrigation commons is divided
    into operational and collective-choice processes. To address the first research
    question, combined with theoretical analysis, survey data from 123 villages in
    18 provinces of China are used to test the mechanism of action reflected in the
    operational process of a rural social-ecological system that needs to cope with
    the impact of urbanization. To address the second research question, the results
    caused by various possible interaction paths of the rural social-ecological system
    responding to the impact of urbanization is summarized. The internal interaction
    mechanism of the rural social-ecological system caused by the impact of urbanization
    both maintains the robustness of rural social-ecological, and also undermines
    the robustness of rural social-ecological system. To address the third research
    question, based on the answers to the first two questions, the practice and exploration
    of rural residents and public departments in the process of rural revitalization
    in China is further combined. The interactive relationship between the operational
    process and collective-choice process reflected in the rural social-ecological
    system of China in response to the impact of urbanization is presented in its
    entirety. In can be concluded that the guarantee and improvement of the operational
    process in the collective-choice process are the reasons why the rural social-ecological
    system can maintain its robustness under external shocks. The interaction mechanism
    within the rural social-ecological system discussed in this paper is only one
    group of concrete mechanisms among many internal interaction mechanisms. In other
    words, this paper studies specific processes or mechanisms in the system. By studying
    these specific interaction mechanisms, we would obtain some restricted views on
    the general laws that may be contained in the complex interaction within the rural
    social-ecological system. The contribution of this paper lies in the empirical
    test of the complex relationship among the components of the rural social-ecological
    system, to identify the internal interaction mechanism of the rural social-ecological
    system in response to external shocks. Based on clarifying this internal mechanism,
    this paper identifies the collective-choice process for the guarantee and improvement
    of the operational process in the rural social-ecological system under external
    shocks as the key to maintain robustness. Thus, a general logic with which various
    countries can promote their rural robustness in policy design is provided from
    a policy perspective. In addition, the study on the interaction mechanism of rural
    irrigation commons under the impact of urbanization also provides a new understanding
    of theoretical ideas and empirical testing methods for further exploring the governance
    of the commons under the influence of complexity. 2. Literature review—the impact
    of urbanization on rural social-ecological system Existing studies have extensively
    discussed the impact of rural labor outmigration caused by urbanization on rural
    economy and society. From the perspective of the rural social-ecological system,
    these studies can be summarized into the following four aspects: the impact of
    rural labor outmigration on resource users, resource systems, public infrastructure,
    and rural governance. First, studies on the impact of labor outmigration on resource
    users mainly focus on two aspects. On the one hand, labor outmigration has improved
    the economic and human capital conditions of farmers. Regarding economic issues,
    non-farm income from the rural labor improves family welfare, and diversifies
    income sources, thus reducing rural poverty (Nguyen et al., 2011, Zhu and Luo,
    2010). In terms of ideology, influenced by urban work and life, the ideology and
    behavior mode of outmigration laborers have changed, which has injected rural
    development with new ideas (Penninx, 1982, Liao et al., 2020). In terms of the
    labor structure, moderate labor outmigration helps to transfer rural surplus labor
    and optimize the allocation structure of rural labor (Qian, 2003, Zhang et al.,
    2018). On the other hand, the outmigration of rural labor has a selective preference
    for age, gender, and individual competence, which will make the young and middle-aged
    rural labors and those with solid personal abilities more likely to seek work
    in urban areas. As a result, the groups remaining in villages and continuing to
    engage in agricultural production are showing the characteristics of aging and
    lack of ability (Liu et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2016), which will further aggravate
    the degree of rural poverty and ultimately harm both agricultural production and
    rural development (Taylor et al., 2003, Atamanov and Berg, 2012, Adams and Cuecuecha,
    2010, Gupta et al., 2009). Second, the most intuitive performance of research
    on the impact of labor outmigration on rural resources is that the impact of labor
    outmigration on farmland resources can be measured. Labor outmigration increases
    the non-agricultural income of rural families. This leads to a decrease in farmers’
    dependence on cultivated land resources and eventually quickly leads to the emergence
    of idle land, abandonment, and destruction of cultivated land (Pfeiffer et al.,
    2009, Qin, 2010). At the same time, the outmigration of many young and middle-aged
    laborers leaves the elderly behind who are unable to complete complex agricultural
    production tasks, thus hindering the adoption of modern agricultural technology
    (Taylor & Martin, 2001), which may also lead to the abandonment of a large area
    of arable land (Liu et al., 2014, Liu and Li, 2017). In this context, certain
    studies have shown that farmland use rights trading (FURT) promoted by labor outmigration
    can alleviate the problem of idle cultivated land resources (Su et al., 2020).
    Promoted by labor outmigration, FURT enables people to realize the large-scale
    management of cultivated land resources. Consequently, the use of advanced agricultural
    production equipment and other advanced agricultural technologies can improve
    the efficiency of agricultural production and ultimately also the output of land
    resources (Islam, 1997, Gao et al., 2020). Third, research on the impact of labor
    outmigration on public infrastructure is mainly reflected in the impacts on hard
    public infrastructure and soft public infrastructure. In terms of soft public
    infrastructure as represented by institutional rules, continuing outmigration
    weakens the social cohesion of villages. This weakening is not conducive to the
    convening of villagers’ meetings and the realization of villagers’ joint decision-making,
    which leads to a failure of institution operation in villages (Wang & Wu, 2018).
    At the same time, the aging of the rural population caused by the outmigration
    of young and middle-aged laborers increases demand for the existing old-age security
    institutions in rural areas (Tao, 2016, Wang et al., 2019). In terms of hard public
    infrastructure represented by artificial facilities, labor outmigration weakens
    the social capital villagers accumulate (Du et al., 2021). Thus, the internal
    coordination cost of public affairs will continuously increase. Ultimately, this
    increase in coordination cost reduces the willingness of rural residents to participate
    in the supply and maintenance of artificial public infrastructure such as irrigation
    channels (Bardhan, 1993, Wang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2022). Moreover, the
    aging of the rural population caused by labor outmigration also further reduces
    the supply and maintenance of artificial public infrastructure (Sun et al., 2011).
    Fourth, research on the impact of labor outmigration on rural governance mainly
    discusses the labor-outmigration induced changes in the leadership structure of
    villages, thus making the traditional village governance system face difficulties
    (Robson & Berkes, 2011). On the one hand, labor outmigration weakens the connection
    between villagers, thus significantly limiting the implementation of formal leadership
    in villages (Wang et al., 2016). On the other hand, with the gradual outmigration
    of competent rural elites, the trust foundation for informal leadership in the
    rural society gradually disappears, leading to the gradual collapse of authority
    trust in rural areas(Joe, 2022). Although existing studies have fully discussed
    all aspects of how urbanization affects rural economy and society, there are still
    areas that merit further discussion. Specifically, first, existing studies have
    conducted relatively independent discussions on the impact of urbanization on
    rural populations, agricultural resources, public infrastructure, and governance
    systems. However, little attention has been paid to whether there is mutual influence
    between the rural population, the resources used, and the supply of public infrastructure
    under the impact of urbanization. As a result, existing studies cannot uncover
    the specific mechanisms of various changes in rural areas under the impact of
    urbanization. Second, existing studies mostly focused on the negative impacts
    of urbanization on rural areas, while lacking systematic attention to the benign
    self-adjustment process in rural areas under the impact of urbanization. This
    causes a lack of comprehensive understanding in decision-makers who are tasked
    with ensuring that rural communities can continue to achieve robust development
    under external shocks. Third, although existing studies have shown that urbanization
    may either promote rural development or induce rural decline, few studies managed
    to further explain why the impact of urbanization manifests as a successful development
    in certain villages, while others decline. Therefore, there is still a lack of
    targeted institutional design logic when people make public policies to guide
    rural development. 3. Analysis framework and theoretical basis 3.1. Analysis framework
    At least three formal conceptual frameworks are commonly applied to study a social-ecological
    system: The institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework (Kiser and
    Ostrom, 1982, Ostrom, 2005, Ostrom, 2011), the robustness framework (Anderies
    et al., 2004, Anderies, 2015), and the social-ecological systems framework (Ostrom,
    2007, Ostrom, 2009). The robustness framework and the social-ecological system
    framework are extensions of the IAD framework and provide complementary means
    to a systematic social-ecological system analysis. The robustness framework is
    designed to allow the analyst to explore feedback, flows, and nonlinearity in
    a social-ecological system, which helps to provide a dynamic system perspective
    that addresses the uncertainty and connectedness of a complex coupled human-natural
    system. This framework is also a means to uncover hidden assumptions and biases
    by providing a common tool to explore the rural social-ecological system from
    a social researcher’s perspective and the perspective of a systems analyst. In
    recent years, to better capture the complexity of the human-nature systems and
    provide consistent terminology across diverse research disciplines, the components
    of the IAD framework and social-ecological system framework have been replaced
    with the notion of infrastructure. Instead of viewing resource systems, resource
    units, governance systems, and actors as external variables, the coupled infrastructure
    system (CIS) perspective views institutions (soft infrastructure) as endogenous.
    This means that institutional characteristics arise from interactions among different
    classes of infrastructure. According to Anderies et al. (2016), there are five
    main types of infrastructure that constitute CISs: (1) hard infrastructure i.e.,
    human-made structures such as roads, irrigation systems, and nuclear power stations
    (cf. Frischmann (2005), “traditional infrastructure”); (2) soft infrastructure
    i.e., collections of human-made “instructions” for using other types of infrastructure
    such as institutional arrangements and decision making processes (cf. Frischmann
    (2005), “intellectual infrastructure”); (3) natural infrastructure i.e., hard
    infrastructure that is not human-made but is critical for society, such as wetlands
    for absorbing and filtering water (cf. Frischmann (2005), “environmental infrastructure”);
    (4) human infrastructure which refers to knowledge (often referred to as “knowledge
    capital” in economics, cf. Frischmann (2005), or “intellectual infrastructure”);
    and (5) social infrastructure which refers to the relationships among humans.
    The CIS framework (Figure 1) establishes the interrelationship between the four
    main components of social-ecological systems: resources, resource users, public
    infrastructure providers, and public infrastructure. Resource users and public
    infrastructure providers are human-based factors (see ellipses in Figure 1). Public
    infrastructure includes hard infrastructure (e.g., irrigation channels) and soft
    infrastructure (i.e., institutional arrangements). Download : Download high-res
    image (185KB) Download : Download full-size image Figure 1. The coupled infrastructure
    system (CIS) framework. Source: Anderies and Janssen (2013). The CIS framework
    is usually used to explore how social-ecological systems respond to external impacts
    to maintain robustness. In this context, robustness refers to “the maintenance
    of some desired system characteristics, for instance, will not induce a transition
    that causes long-term human suffering (Anderies & Janssen, 2004), or will not
    lead to a reduction in people''s living standards, despite fluctuations in the
    behavior of its component parts or its environment” (Carlson and Doyle, 2002).
    Related concepts developed by Carlson and Doyle (2002) suggest that systems that
    are subjected to a particular type and degree of variability may become highly
    optimized to tolerate this variability (this characteristic of adaptive systems
    is referred to as highly optimized tolerance (HOT)). In this conceptualization,
    social-ecological systems refer to complex adaptive systems composed of human
    and nonhuman subsystems embedded in larger systems. Complex adaptive systems have
    diverse interacting biophysical and social components and an autonomous selection
    process through which certain components are reproduced (Arthur et al., 1997,
    Levin, 1998). Complex systems adapt to change through these interactions and selection
    processes (Levin, 1998). Compared with other frameworks used to study social-ecological
    systems, the CIS framework highlights fundamental interactions within social-ecological
    systems that have often been overlooked in the past but that are especially important
    concerning robustness (Anderies & Janssen, 2004). Therefore, the most prominent
    feature of the CIS framework is that it adds eight links between the internal
    components of the social-ecological system based on retaining the essential components
    of the original social-ecological system. Through the description of eight groups
    of links among the internal components of the social-ecological system, the CIS
    framework provides the possibility for people to investigate how the internal
    system of the social-ecological system responds to external impacts to maintain
    its robustness. With the deepening of research on these eight groups of interaction
    links, Anderies and Janssen (2004) further pointed out that not all eight groups
    of relations are at the same institutional level. The eight groups of interaction
    links in the CIS framework not only reflect the operational processes of how resource
    users influence the resources system and public infrastructure through decision-making.
    They also reflect the collective-choice processes of how public infrastructure
    providers influence the decision-making of resource users and the public infrastructure.
    Specifically, on the one hand, the operational processes reflect the changes that
    the links between resource users, resources, and public infrastructure have to
    make under external impacts (links 1, 5, 6, and 4); on the other hand, collective-choice
    processes clarify the operational rights and responsibilities of resource users,
    and provide alternative paths and schemes, or constrain the occurrence of related
    options (links 3 and 4) (Ostrom, 2005). In this paper, the irrigation commons
    are conceptualized as CIS, consisting of interconnections among infrastructural,
    institutional, and natural processes. The analytical framework is shown in Figure
    2 linking theory and evidence about governance patterns of land–water resources
    and human society in the irrigation commons that shape one of the core samples
    of the rural social-ecological system in China. Figure 2 provides the fundamental
    analysis logic: the large-scale outmigration of rural labor caused by urbanization
    represents an external impact on the irrigation commons. Then, the operational
    processes of the irrigation system in response to the external impact are started,
    namely the impact of urbanization pushes the change of interaction links among
    resource users, resources, and public infrastructure. However, the impact of these
    operational processes on the robustness of the irrigation system is uncertain.
    Therefore, the irrigation commons further adjust the composition of public infrastructure
    providers to form a guarantee or improvement of the operational processes by the
    collective-choice processes. The final requirement is that the irrigation commons
    can maintain robustness under external impacts. Download : Download high-res image

    3.2. The operational processes of the rural social-ecological system responding
    to the impact of urbanization 3.2.1. Changes in the relationship between resource
    users and resources The impact of rapid urbanization on irrigation commons first
    manifests in a reduction of the number of resource users. In reality, this manifests
    in large-scale rural labor outmigration. Many labor forces leave rural areas and
    enter the cities, thus increasingly separating the relationship between resource
    users and resources in the irrigation commons. A major resulting problem is the
    abandonment of large areas of land in the countryside (Liu et al., 2014, Liu and
    Li, 2017). This abandonment makes it possible to conduct large-scale farmland
    operations to obtain higher agricultural income through FURT (Wang et al., 2020).
    Therefore, in China, FURT promoted by the market mechanism has become the primary
    manifestation of the first round of self-adjustment of the irrigation commons
    under the impact of urbanization. FURT is an adjustment of man-land relationships
    in rapid urbanization in China’s rural areas. Farmers who do not want to engage
    in agriculture can receive rent by leasing their land. In contrast, farmers and
    organizations who want to expand their production scale can realize economies
    of scale by renting farmland. FURT has induced two significant changes in land
    use patterns in rural China, which promote economies of scale and make farm production
    more efficient. First, FURT allows farmers to rent the farmland use rights of
    other farmers; second, FURT can potentially promote land consolidation, which
    would address the problem of tiny and highly fragmented farm lots (Su et al.,
    2020). The emergence of FURT is a self-adjustment of the irrigation commons to
    the increasingly estranged relationship between resource users and resources caused
    by labor outmigration. This self-adjustment will revolve around the economic and
    social security functions of China’s rural land and produce two possible results.
    On the one hand, in rural areas with a moderate proportion of labor outmigration,
    continuous development of labor outmigration will further promote FURT. In China,
    the long-term dual isolation between urban and rural areas has resulted in the
    accumulation of a large amount of surplus labor in rural areas and severe farmland
    fragmentation (Zang et al., 2019). However, when urbanization leads to a moderate
    scale of labor outmigration, the rapid growth of farmland operation income, non-agricultural
    employment income, and land rental income increase the effectivity of the economic
    function of farmland compared with that of the social security function of the
    farmland. Specifically, the decrease in surplus labor force improves the efficiency
    of farmland management and stimulates the demand for more large-scale farmland
    management. Moreover, in households with predominantly off-farm employment, due
    to the lack of agricultural labour, it is necessary to hire workers to carry out
    production and management activities on the land. This leads to higher land operating
    costs and lower operating profits, as land operating income is often much lower
    than the economic income derived from leasing land. Therefore, when the economic
    function of land takes precedence, farmers engaged in off-farm work will choose
    to lease the land to obtain more economic income. Therefore, the moderate scale
    of labor outmigration not only creates a demand for FURT in rural areas but also
    promotes the supply of farmlands that can be used for FURT. Ultimately, the promotion
    of the moderate scale of labor outmigration for FURT is formed under the mechanism
    of supply and demand. On the other hand, in rural areas where the proportion of
    labor outmigration is comparatively large, a further push of labor outmigration
    may inhibit FURT. In China, when the level of labour outmigration reaches a critical
    point, the transferring party of FURT transitions from small farmers within the
    village to foreign enterprises. The mass outmigration of farmers possessing the
    ability to transfer others’ land contributes to this shift. However, small farmers
    are in a weak position in FURT transactions with foreign enterprises. As a result,
    the risk of losing the right to operate the land and experiencing a decline in
    land fertility is greatly increased compared to transactions with villagers within
    the same village. Specifically, on the one hand, to ensure the recovery of investment,
    enterprises often sign land lease contracts with villagers for extended periods,
    exceeding 20 years. This extended duration can lead to a situation where, despite
    nominal land ownership by farmers, the actual management right of the land remains
    outside their control for an extended period, hindering their ability to derive
    operating income from the land. Additionally, driven by profit maximization motives,
    enterprises may alter land without considering the long-term interests of farmers.
    This can result in a decline in soil fertility and even render the land unsuitable
    for replanting. The combination of these factors elevates the risks and contributes
    to the loss of the land''s original social security function. In this context,
    for households with mainly off-farm employment, it is more important to retain
    the right to manage the land to ensure the original security function of the land
    than to lease it for economic income. As a result, in areas with relatively severe
    population loss, continuous labor outmigration trends may lead people to refrain
    from transferring land. This dynamic ultimately contributes to the inhibition
    of FURT when the level of labour outflow becomes excessively high. In summary,
    as shown in Figure 3, under the impact of the labor outmigration, the interaction
    between resource users and resources in the rural social-ecological system manifests
    as follows: on the one hand, if labor outmigration has a moderate scale, the optimization
    of the resource user population structure will stimulate demand for large-scale
    operation and the supply of idle land; thus, under the dominance of the economic
    function, the labor outmigration force will promote FURT. On the other hand, in
    certain regions where the scale of labor outmigration is relatively large, the
    continuous outmigration of labor force may increase the survival risks of losing
    the right to operate the land and the risk of depleting the fertility of the soil,
    the land security function is threatened due to the higher risk during the FURT
    process. Therefore, any further development of labor outmigration may lead to
    the suppression of FURT when farmers will give priority to ensuring the social
    security function of the land. Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download

    outmigration (LM) and farmland use rights trading (FURT). 3.2.2. The impact of
    the changing relationship between resource users and resources on the supply of
    public infrastructure In irrigation commons, the supply of public infrastructure
    includes the maintenance of hard infrastructure (such as irrigation canals) and
    the agreement of soft infrastructure (such as water use rules). The construction
    and maintenance of irrigation canals and the agreement on water use rules must
    be supported by collective actions (Ostrom, 1990, Araral, 2009). In China, although
    the government currently funds many irrigation canals in rural areas, the maintenance
    of irrigation infrastructure, especially the maintenance of sub-canals at the
    end of the irrigation canal system (e.g., removing silt and repairing cracks)
    should be done through regular collective actions by the rural residents. At the
    same time, irrigation affairs about who is responsible for managing and monitoring
    the operation of the infrastructure, who decides how much maintenance cost is
    required, and how much water to allocate to each farmland plot along the irrigation
    canal, how to solve water disputes, and other problems, all require mutual negotiation
    and cooperation among rural residents. These affairs also require much collective
    action. As the level of collective action determines the level of public infrastructure
    supply(Ostrom, 1990, Araral, 2009, Bardhan, 1993), the change of public infrastructure
    supply manifested by the change of collective action, caused by the change of
    the relationship between resource users and resources, has become the main manifestation
    of the second round of self-adjustment initiated by the irrigation commons under
    the impact of urbanization. Under the current land policy of China, Su et al.
    (2020) observed that a moderate scale of FURT will lead to two significant developments
    in the village: the development of a new farmers'' class and the development of
    cooperatives. These two significant developments affect leadership and social
    capital, which will influence irrigation collective action and the provision of
    irrigation public infrastructure (Wang et al., 2022). Specifically, a moderate
    scale of FURT will create a new middle-class of farmers in rural China. Initiated
    by the continuous labor outmigration force, these middle-class farmers face the
    conditions to integrate farmland and carry out large-scale farmland operations
    in rural areas. These new middle-class farmers’ income level is not lower than
    that of migrant farmers, their central interest relationship revolves around the
    farmland, and thus, their demand for production and living infrastructure is strong.
    Their primary social relations are in the rural area, and thus, they are the most
    active participants in village public affairs. The production and life of the
    middle-class farmers are inseparable from the farmland and rural society, and
    thus, they are the most reasonable farmers and the least likely to become free
    riders. Therefore, the solid public service motivation places the middle-class
    farmers at the core of the force promoting collective action in rural area. In
    China, many middle-class farmers in rural areas take the initiative and become
    representatives of village leadership, which supplements the lack of public leadership
    under labor outmigration. Therefore, it can be predicted that the emergence of
    these middle-class farmers can promote the formation of rural collective action
    and ultimately also the supply of irrigation public infrastructure. At the same
    time, when the proportion of FURT in rural China is not large, the limited scale
    of income cannot attract large companies to rent farmland. This situation has
    caused economic organizations that are organized by farmers themselves to become
    the other part of the outcome of China''s rural FURT. Among them, farmer cooperatives
    are important representatives of these new farmer economic organizations. Cooperatives
    have reshaped both the trust and norms of conduct among rural residents and enhanced
    their sense of belonging to the rural area they inhabit. They also alleviated
    the problems of insufficient accumulation of social capital and loss of sense
    of belonging caused by labor outmigration. Farmers’ cooperatives promote the solution
    of collective action for irrigation, and finally promote the supply of public
    infrastructure for irrigation. In the context of the Chinese institution system,
    farmland use rights can be traded to different subjects, but farmland is owned
    collectively by villagers. Therefore, middle-class farmers or farmers who organize
    cooperatives are co-owners of farmland. Therefore, a moderate scale of FURT allows
    the owners of farmland to dominate farmland management, thus transforming the
    farmland management process into a process of negotiation and cooperation between
    co-owners. Thus, the formation of collective action is promoted and the effective
    supply of public infrastructure for irrigation would be made possible. However,
    according to the observations and investigation presented in this paper, when
    the scale of FURT reaches a specific critical threshold, further expansion of
    FURT will seriously undermine irrigation collective actions. Large-scale FURT
    may aggravate large-size land management to exclude labor, thus further weakening
    the basis for the formation of irrigation collective action. Moreover, large-scale
    FURT is often accompanied by industrial and commercial capital flow into rural
    areas, causing middle-class farmers to lose their land base in the countryside.
    As a result, the middle-class farmers who provide many mechanisms for the formation
    of irrigation collective action gradually disappear, and irrigation collective
    action will lose its core strength (He, 2011). In addition, the flow of industrial
    and commercial capital into rural areas may replace traditional rural relations
    with economic relations. The loss of trust and relationship networks among villagers
    further reduces people’s sense of community in the village. In essence, an excessively
    large FURT will increase the cost of farmland scale management beyond what both
    the middle-class farmers and the farmers’ economic organization can afford. This
    leads to the domination of farmland management by industrial organizations and
    commercial companies that can run the organization and management based on advanced
    technology and economies of scale. Thus, the process of cooperation between co-owners
    is broken and the basis of collective action in rural areas is destroyed. As a
    result, such large-scale FURT may cause industrial organizations and commercial
    companies to take over the operation of farmland and establish their privately
    owned production facility system. Consequently, the role of public infrastructure
    in agricultural production and operation may weaken, ultimately leading to the
    possible decline of public infrastructure for irrigation. In Conclusion, as shown
    in Figure 4, the internal interaction process of the irrigation commons caused
    by the change of relationship between resource users and resources presents two
    possible outcomes. On the one hand, if the scale of FURT is moderate, farmland
    management dominated by farmland owners will promote irrigation collective action
    and thus promote the supply of irrigation public infrastructure; on the other
    hand, if the scale of FURT is large and farmland management is taken over by non-landowners,
    continued development of FURT may inhibit irrigation collective action, and thus
    inhibit the supply of irrigation public infrastructure. Download : Download high-res

    relationship between farmland use rights trading (FURT) and public infrastructure
    (PI) supply. 3.2.3. Operational paths and results of the rural social-ecological
    system in response to the impact of urbanization The construction and maintenance
    of irrigation infrastructure, as well as the design and implementation of irrigation
    management rules, ensure the continued guarantee of good livelihoods for people
    who live in areas with poor natural conditions. In addition, these measures also
    maintain stable production in regions with good natural conditions in the changing
    climate and society, thereby safeguarding the livelihood of the people inhabiting
    these regions. Therefore, a good supply of public infrastructure has been recognized
    as an essential factor for determining the robustness of irrigation commons(Muneepeerakul
    and Anderies, 2017, Muneepeerakul and Anderies, ,2020). Therefore, as long as
    the irrigation public infrastructure is effectively supplied, even if a resource
    user leaves the irrigation commons, it will not threaten the livelihood security
    of the users remaining in the system, indicating that the irrigation commons realize
    robustness (Gurmu et al., 2019). If the public infrastructure of the irrigation
    commons cannot be effectively supplied, the ability of resource users to benefit
    from water and land resources is weakened, and it becomes challenging to maintain
    livelihoods (Anderies, 2004). At this point, people in the system will withdraw
    from their role as resource users of the irrigation commons and strive for livelihood
    opportunities outside of the system (Muneepeerakul and Anderies, 2020). In response,
    the irrigation commons face collapse. The possible paths for the internal interaction
    of the rural social-ecological system under the impact of urbanization, and the
    possible results of these possible internal interaction paths for the robustness
    of the rural social-ecological system can be identified. This identification is
    based on the following: the relationship between the supply of public irrigation
    infrastructure and the robustness of the irrigation commons; possible changes
    in the relationship between resource users and land resources in the rural social-ecological
    system caused by the impact of urbanization (i.e., the inverted U-shaped relationship
    between labor outmigration and FURT); and the possible impact of changes in the
    relationship between resource users and land resources on public infrastructure
    (i.e., the inverted U-shaped relationship between FURT and public infrastructure
    supply). Figure 5 shows the fundamental form of the possible paths of how labor
    outmigration affects the robustness of the rural social-ecological system through
    FURT based on the previous analysis. Figure 5 is called the “fundamental form”
    because it includes all possible paths through which labor outmigration can affect
    the robustness of rural socio-ecological systems via FURT. In Appendix A, several
    other possible paths are shown through which labor outmigration can affect the
    robustness of rural social-ecological systems through FURT. Those paths, whether
    those that have been listed or those that have not been listed, are either variations
    of the fundamental form or reflect part of the fundamental form, as shown in Figure
    5. Therefore, the connotation of the impact mechanism they present can be obtained
    from the explanation of the fundamental in Figure 5. Download : Download high-res
    image (159KB) Download : Download full-size image Figure 5. Fundamental forms
    of possible paths through which LM affects the PI and the robustness of rural
    social-ecological systems via FURT. In Figure 5, the impact path corresponding
    to the line segment a–b (path ab for short) is characterized by labor outmigration
    and FURT at a moderate scale. In such areas, labor outmigration improves the man-land
    relationship, and is positively correlated with FURT. At this time, the continuous
    outmigration of rural labor will promote the formation of FURT, and the continuous
    development of FURT can realize the optimization of irrigation infrastructure
    and water management institutions by promoting irrigation collective action. Such
    an internal interaction process not only enables resource users who go out to
    work to obtain more income from wages, but also enables resource users who remain
    in the irrigation commons obtain better institutions and facility guarantees.
    This reflects the positive response of the irrigation commons to the optimization
    of the resource user demographic structure (e.g., the reduction of surplus labor)
    after labor outmigration. Consequently, the internal interaction of the irrigation
    commons increases the compatibility between resource users’ livelihood and labor
    outmigration, thus realizing the benign process of the social-ecological system
    automatically entering the robustness cycle. The impact path corresponding to
    the line segment b–c (path bc for short) is characterized by a moderate scale
    of labor outmigration, but an excessively large scale of FURT. In areas with this
    situation, although labor outmigration can promote the development of FURT, the
    continued development of an already large-scale FURT will cause the collective
    action of the irrigation commons to fail. This failure will lead to the destruction
    of the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and the operation of irrigation
    institutional rules. Although such internal interaction improves the relationship
    between resource users and resources, it cannot sufficiently adapt to the negative
    impact large-scale FURT induces on the supply of public infrastructure. Therefore,
    the destruction of public infrastructure caused by such an internal interaction
    process will cause resource users to choose to migrate outward because they cannot
    achieve a beneficial situation in the social-ecological system. Thus, the social-ecological
    system is caused to fall into an unsustainable cycle of “population exodus → deterioration
    of livelihood → population exodus”, which continues to lead to the collapse of
    social-ecological systems. The impact path corresponding to the line segment c–d
    (path cd for short) is characterized by the problems caused by the simultaneous
    large scale labor outmigration and the large scale FURT. In such areas, large-scale
    labor outmigration inhibits the occurrence of FURT, resulting in a negative correlation
    between labor outmigration and FURT. However, at the same time, this trend of
    FURT slows down with continuing outmigration of the labor force, thus effectively
    restraining the negative impact large-scale FURT imposes on irrigation collective
    action, and finally improving irrigation infrastructure and water management institutions.
    Such an internal interaction process effectively inhibits the excessively high
    demand for FURT in the case of excessive population loss. This reflects an active
    defensive process the social-ecological system initiates by adjusting the man-land
    relationship in case of irreversible labor outmigration. This active defensive
    process lets resource users realize that even if they continue to go out to work,
    this will not affect the people who are still in the system to gain the benefits
    from public infrastructure. This realization results in irrigation commons of
    self-regulation also achieving compatibility between resource users’ livelihood
    and labor outmigration trend, thus realizing the benign process of the social-ecological
    system automatically entering the robustness cycle. The impact path corresponding
    to the line segment d–e (path de for short) is characterized by severe labor loss,
    but the level of FURT is not high. In areas with this situation, large-scale labor
    outmigration inhibits the development of FURT, making it impossible for people
    in the irrigation commons to promote the formation of irrigation collective action
    by carrying out FURT. Eventually, this leads to the decline of irrigation infrastructure
    and irrigation management institutions. Such an internal interaction process represents
    an irreconcilable contradiction between the high-speed change in the structure
    of resource users (in the form of large scale labor outmigration) and the low-speed
    adjustment of the relationship between resource users and resources (in the form
    of a low level of FURT). Therefore, the negative impact of such an internal interaction
    process on public infrastructure will cause resource users to choose to migrate
    outward because they cannot achieve a beneficial situation in the social-ecological
    system. This, the social-ecological system falls into a vicious circle of “population
    exodus → deterioration of livelihood → population exodus”, which continues to
    lead to the decay of social-ecological systems. The above analysis theoretically
    illustrates the nonlinear impact of labor outmigration on FURT. This nonlinear
    impact may further affect the supply of public infrastructure and the robustness
    of the social-ecological system through the nonlinear relationship between FURT
    and public infrastructure supply. At the same time, the above-discussed four paths
    (paths ab, bc, cd, and de) of how labor outmigration can affect the robustness
    of rural social-ecological systems through FURT may exist simultaneously in the
    response of social-ecological systems to the impact of urbanization (as shown
    in Figure 5), or only part of them may exist (as shown in Appendix A). The specific
    paths through which labor outmigration affects the robustness of rural social-ecological
    systems also need to be determined according to specific circumstances. Furthermore,
    as shown in Figure 5 and Appendix A, no matter what the impact labor outmigration
    imposes (via FURT) on the robustness of the rural social-ecological system, the
    results of these different influence paths can be generalized into two types:
    the benign path where urbanization promotes the rural social-ecological system
    into a robustness cycle (paths ab and cd), and the unhealthy path where urbanization
    causes the rural social-ecological system to enter a weak cycle (paths bc and
    de). 3.3. The collective-choice processes of rural social-ecological systems in
    response to the impact of urbanization The results of the operational processes
    underlying the response of the rural social-ecological system to the impact of
    urbanization will further affect and be affected by the collective-choice processes
    (through links 2 and 3). Such impact processes are mainly realized through changes
    in public infrastructure providers caused by changes in public infrastructure
    and resource users. On the one hand, the results of operational processes will
    impose new requirements on the original public infrastructure providers to promote
    the collective-choice process and provide institutional rules that enable the
    effective maintenance of operational processes. On the other hand, the results
    of operational processes will call for the emergence of new public infrastructure
    providers to provide the possibility of a reversal of the predicament for those
    operational processes that cannot achieve benign results (such as paths bc and
    de). Figure 1 indicates that because external changes will also impact public
    infrastructure providers, the collective-choice process called for by the operational
    processes that cannot be provided by the rural social-ecological system itself,
    can also be achieved through external forces (link 7). In this paper, the rural
    social-ecological system’s collective-choice processes in response to the impact
    of urbanization will be analyzed based on the empirical test of the internal interaction
    in the operational processes in Section 7. 3.4. Research hypotheses When collecting
    questionnaire data in Chinese provinces, the research team conducted many field
    interviews and on-site observations. The team found that in the context of China,
    the moderate scale of labor outmigration to promote FURT could be observed in
    many areas. In certain other regions, it has also been observed that the large-scale
    outmigration of the labor force makes people start to rely on the land for survival,
    thus inhibiting the transfer of land. At the same time, in many areas, a moderate
    scale of FURT can be observed to promote the collective action of irrigation.
    In other areas, the domination of industrial and commercial capital on large-scale
    land leads to the general decline of rural collective action. Therefore, based
    on the research and judgment of the research team regarding the overall situation
    in China, it can be suggested that it is very likely that a nonlinear “inverted
    U-shaped” relationship exists between labor outmigration and FURT, and also a
    nonlinear “inverted U-shaped” relationship between FURT and PI supply. This means
    that in the Chinese context, the nonlinear impact of labor outmigration on FURT
    is highly likely to further affect the supply of PI and the robustness of the
    social-ecological system through the nonlinear relationship between FURT and PI
    supply. Table 1 summarizes the operational process of the rural social-ecological
    system in response to the impact of urbanization in the Chinese context. Table

    nonlinear relationship between FURT and PI supply. Remains to be proven Empirical
    tests of the internal interaction of the operational processes of the rural social-ecological
    system in response to the impact of urbanization form the basis for a comprehensive
    analysis of relevant robustness mechanisms of this system. Based on the summary
    provided in Table 1, in this paper, the following internal relationship hypotheses
    about the operational processes of rural social-ecological systems in response
    to the impact of urbanization under the Chinese context are proposed: H1: In the
    internal interaction between resource users and resources, there is a nonlinear
    “inverted U-shaped” relationship between labor outmigration and farmland use rights
    trading. H2: In the process underlying the relationship between resource users
    and resources impacts on the supply of public infrastructure, there is a nonlinear
    “inverted U-shaped” relationship between farmland use rights trading and the supply
    of public infrastructure. If the above two hypotheses pass empirical testing,
    the internal mechanism hypothesis about the operational processes of the rural
    social-ecological systems responding to the impact of urbanization can be further
    deduced: H3: Under the influence of urbanization, the nonlinear impact of labor
    outmigration on FURT will further affect the supply of public infrastructure and
    the robustness of the social-ecological system through the nonlinear relationship
    between FURT and public infrastructure supply. In the following parts of this
    paper, these hypotheses are tested using survey data. 4. Data, variable selection,
    and method 4.1. Data The data used in this study were collected as part of a survey
    by the China Institute for Rural Studies (CIRS) of Tsinghua University in 2016.
    The survey contents include information on agricultural production, farmer’s income
    and expenses, rural environment, implementation of agricultural policies, and
    information on irrigation (such as the construction, maintenance, investment,
    and benefit of irrigation facilities). The questionnaire data were mainly provided
    by leaders familiar with the situation in the village. Questionnaires were framed
    according to the social-ecological system framework, which is also fit for the
    CIS framework (Su et al., 2020). From March to June 2016, the CIRS recruited university
    students across China for the survey. Four experts at CIRS trained the students
    to ensure that these students could collect data appropriately during the survey.
    The survey was conducted from July to September 2016 when most Chinese universities
    were on summer vacation. Sixty groups of students were assigned to the target
    villages to operate the survey. A total of 123 village-level questionnaires were
    obtained, covering 14 provinces. The distribution of the 123 observations from
    the 18 provinces is shown in Table 2 and Figure 6. The survey covers almost all
    major irrigation areas in China except for the northeastern region. Table 2. Distribution

    variables It is clear from the previous section that the effective supply of public
    infrastructure is a key determinant of whether the social-ecological system is
    deemed robust or not. Anderies (2015) pointed out that public infrastructure in
    CIS consists of hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. Among them, hard
    infrastructure mainly refers to ditches, reservoirs, and wells required for farmland
    irrigation, and soft infrastructure mainly refers to institutional arrangements
    and decision-making processes related to farmland irrigation. Because ditches
    are the most common infrastructure in farmland irrigation systems, according to
    the research of Bardhan, 2001, Klümper and Theesfeld, 2017, and Zang et al., (2019),
    the “overall maintenance of village irrigation infrastructure in the past three
    years” (MAINTAIN) (with levels of 1 = very poor to 5 = very good) was selected
    to measure the supply of hard infrastructure in farmland irrigation systems. A
    water use institution is part of essential soft infrastructure, and its implementation
    can be used to measure the supply of soft infrastructure (Janssen & Anderies,
    2013). When the water use institution is implemented effectively, water use conflicts
    will emerge less frequently; in contrast, when the water use institution is not
    effectively implemented, water use conflicts will increase (Trawick, 2001). Therefore,
    in reference to the research of Wang and Wu (2018), “whether conflicts over water
    use frequently occur between villagers” (CONFLICT) (with levels of 1 = conflict
    frequently to 5 = conflict rarely) was selected as the dependent variable to measure
    the supply of soft infrastructure in the farmland irrigation system. 4.3. Core
    independent variables In this paper, FURT and labor outmigration are taken as
    core independent variables. On the one hand, this paper uses “the ratio of the
    area of cultivated land obtained by FURT in the village to the total area of cultivated
    land in the village” as the index to measure the extent of FURT. According to
    the two hypotheses, this paper pays more attention to the behavior of “trade in”
    during FURT. This paper focuses on the area of cultivated land obtained by FURT
    from individuals or organizations who belong to the village. In this study, the
    cultivated land obtained through FURT is referred to the cultivated land in the
    village. On the other hand, this paper selects “the ratio of rural migrant labors
    to the total number of rural labors” (Loutmigration) as the index to measure the
    outmigration of labor force. 4.4. Controlled variables In the rural social-ecological
    system, the robustness of irrigation commons is affected by many factors, which
    were allocated into two categories of variables by SES (Anderies et al., 2013):
    biophysical conditions and socioeconomic attributes. Given that resource users
    face different incentives in different physical worlds, biophysical conditions
    become an essential factor affecting the robustness of the rural social-ecological
    system. Drawing on experience from Wang et al. (2016), the variables for measuring
    biophysical conditions were selected from the following two dimensions: the geographic
    location of the village and the condition of water resources. The selected geographic
    variables include “whether the village is located on a plain” (PLAIN), “whether
    the village is located in a suburb” (SUBURBAN), “distance from the village to
    the nearest city” (DTC), “distance from the village to the nearest tertiary highway”
    (DL) and “latitude of the village” (XAS). The selected water condition variables
    include “village water resources conditions” (WATERCONDITION), and “annual water
    production modulus of the province where the village is located in” (WATERMOD).
    Among these variables, PLAIN and WATERCONDITION were obtained via questionnaire
    survey, WATERMOD was extracted from the Yearbook of China Water Resources, and
    DTC and XAS were acquired using the geographic information system. In their study
    of the CIS framework, Andries (2016) pointed out that socioeconomic attributes
    affect resource users and the provision of public infrastructure. Su et al. (2020)
    further described socioeconomic attributes in terms of the village population,
    economic development level, and income gap. According to their work, the following
    variables were selected to characterize socioeconomic attributes: “the village’s
    relative economic level” (ECO), “village poverty level” (PROVERTY), “village’s
    dependence on water resources” (DEPENDENCE), “proportion of villagers covered
    by major illness insurance” (MEIN), “income gap between villagers” (INGAP), “total
    village population” (POP), and “whether pinching or interception of irrigation
    water often occurred in the village” (PIW). Data on these variables were all obtained
    via questionnaire survey. To ensure the robustness of estimated results, provincial
    dummy variables were introduced into the independent variables to control for
    the effects of interregional differences on the estimated results. However, in
    this survey, a close correlation may also exist between the robustness of irrigation
    commons and the agricultural production of the region villages are located. This
    means that, if the provincial dummy variable alone is used to control differences
    in agricultural production activities between different regions, it may not be
    possible to fully control the effect of interregional differences. To overcome
    this lack of control, the dummy variable of agricultural production regions is
    further introduced to control for differences in agricultural production activities
    between different regions. According to the National Plan for sustainable Agricultural
    Development, the 123 sample villages investigated in this paper were divided into
    seven agricultural production regions: the northern arid and semi-arid region,
    the South China region, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain region, the Loess Plateau region,
    the Sichuan Basin and its periphery region, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region,
    and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In this process, to avoid
    collinearity, the variable of whether sample villages belong to the northern arid
    and semi-arid region was not added to control variables. Table 3 provides the
    definitions, assignments, and descriptive statistics of the variables selected
    in this paper. Table 3. Variable selection and descriptive statistics. Variable

    5.1. Method According to the proposed hypotheses, in this paper, the nonlinear
    relationship between labor outmigration, FURT, and public infrastructure supply
    is examined. Thus, in the construction of the econometric model, the nonlinear
    relationship between LMIGRATION and FURT is described by constructing Equation
    (1). The nonlinear relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply
    (MAINTAIN and CONFLICT) is described by Equations (2), (3). (1) (2) (3) Where
    LMIGRATION represents the degree of labor outmigration, FURT represents the degree
    of farmland use rights trading, and MAINTAIN and CONFLICT represent the supply
    of hard public infrastructure supply and soft public infrastructure supply in
    the irrigation commons, respectively. The X in Equation (1) represents the control
    variables that may affect FURT. V in Equation (2) are control variables that may
    affect MAINTAIN. W in Equation (3) are control variables that may affect CONFLICT.
    As implied by the hypotheses proposed above, there may be an “inverted U-shaped”
    relationship between LMIGRATION and FURT, and a significant nonlinear relationship
    between FURT and public infrastructure provision (MAINTAIN and CONFLICT). Therefore,
    a quadratic term that characterizes the nonlinear effect of LMIGRATION on FURT
    was introduced into Equation (1) to test hypothesis H1. A quadratic term that
    characterizes the nonlinear effect of FURT on the provision of irrigation public
    infrastructure (MAINTAIN and CONFLICT) was introduced into Equations (2), (3)
    to test hypothesis H2. To test hypothesis H3, whether LMIGRATION will affect the
    supply of irrigation public infrastructure (MAINTAIN and CONFLICT) through FURT
    must be assessed. This is achieved by examining the mediating effect consisting
    of Equations (1), (2) as well as Equations (1), (3). The construction and test
    of the mediating effect is realized based on the research of Hayes Andrew and
    Preacher (2010). Because the process of interpretation and testing of mediating
    effects is the same for Equations (2), (3), this paper takes Equation (2) as an
    example to illustrate the construction and test steps of the mediating effects.
    According to Equation (1), at its most general, the rate at which a change in
    LMIGRATION changes the supply of irrigation public infrastructure indirectly through
    changes in FURT, which is denoted as θ1 (see Equation (4)), can be estimated as
    the product of the first partial derivative of the FURT concerning LMIGRATION
    and the first partial derivative of MAINTAIN (CONFLICT in Equation (3)) concerning
    FURT. This reflects the strength and form of the impact of LMIGRATION on the supply
    of irrigation public infrastructure through FURT. Therefore, the statistical significance
    test of each variable coefficient in θ1 can help to assess whether influence mechanisms
    of labor outmigration affect the supply of public infrastructure through FURT,
    as well as the possible number of the influence paths: (4) In θ1, the coefficients
    f nclude both the nonlinear effect of LMIAGRATION on FURT (α2) and the nonlinear
    effect of FURT on public infrastructure Therefore, if the coefficient of s significant,
    the nonlinear impact of labor outmigration on FURT will further affect the supply
    of public infrastructure through the nonlinear relationship between FURT and public
    infrastructure supply. There are at most four possible paths through which labor
    outmigration can affect the supply of public infrastructure through FURT. The
    coefficients f nclude both the nonlinear effect of LMIAGRATION on FURT (α2) and
    the nonlinear effect of FURT on public infrastructure (δ2). Therefore, if the
    coefficient of s significant and that of s not, the nonlinear impact of labor
    outmigration on FURT will further affect the supply of public infrastructure through
    the nonlinear relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply. There
    are at most three possible paths for labor outmigration to affect the supply of
    public infrastructure through FURT. The coefficients f nclude both the nonlinear
    effect of LMIAGRATION on FURT (α2) and the nonlinear effect of FURT on public
    infrastructure (δ2). Therefore, if the coefficient of s significant, while the
    coefficients of nd re not, the nonlinear impact of labor outmigration on FURT
    will further affect the supply of public infrastructure through the nonlinear
    relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply. There are at most
    two possible paths through which labor outmigration can affect the supply of public
    infrastructure through FURT. The constant term nly includes the nonlinear effect
    of FURT on public infrastructure (δ2) but does not include the nonlinear effect
    of LMIGRATION on FURT (α2). Therefore, if the constant term in θ1 is significant,
    while the coefficients of and re not, the nonlinear effect of labor outmigration
    on FURT will not occur through the nonlinear relationship between FURT and public
    infrastructure. A linear relationship ultimately impacts the supply of public
    infrastructure. Based on the discussion of the mediating effect test in Hayes
    Andrew and Preacher (2010), the bias-corrected percentile bootstrap confidence
    interval is used to test the statistical significance of the coefficients of each
    variable in θ1. If the coefficient of at least one non-constant parameter in Equation
    (4) passes the significance test, the nonlinear effect of labor outmigration on
    FURT will further impact the supply of public infrastructure through the nonlinear
    relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply, thus corroborating
    hypothesis H3. In Equations (1), (2), (3), MAINTAIN is an ordered discrete variable
    from 1 to 5, CONFLICT is a dummy variable, and FURT and LMIGTAION are continuous
    real numbers. Therefore, to estimate econometric models, the IV-OLS model is selected
    to realize the estimation of Equation (1), the IV-OPROBIT model is selected to
    realize the estimation of Equation (2), and the IV-PROBIT model is selected to
    realize the estimation of Equation (3). The statistical software STATA is used
    for the estimation, applying the principles and operation processes of the above
    models from Roodman (2011). When using the Bootstrap method to estimate the significance
    of the coefficients in Equation (4), MPLUS software is used. 5.2. Endogenous problems
    and selection of instrumental variables Endogeneity problems may affect the estimation
    results. First, as pointed out in existing studies, climate change affects FURT
    and gradually becomes an essential driver of irrigation public infrastructure
    provision (Chai & Zeng, 2018). For this reason, the effects of factors that are
    not directly observable (such as climate change) on the estimated results must
    be controlled. Second, reverse causality may exist between FURT and the provision
    of irrigation public infrastructure as well as between labor outmigration and
    FURT. On the one hand, FURT involves the coordination of numerous small-scale
    farmers in China; therefore, a village with stable irrigation public infrastructure
    provision is more likely to possess robust collective action capacity and achieve
    large-scale FURT. On the other hand, a higher level of FURT implies higher land
    rent income, and rural households with higher land rent income can afford higher
    migration costs, which may drive labor outmigration (Xiao & Zhao, 2018). Therefore,
    the influence of the reverse causality between core independent and dependent
    variables mentioned above on the estimated results must also be controlled. The
    impact of endogeneity on the estimated results can be controlled by introducing
    instrumental variables (IVs) (Wooldridge, 2009). An effective IV must meet three
    necessary conditions: (i) correlation criterion, where the IV should exert a causal
    effect on core independent variables; (ii) independence criterion, where there
    is no confounding for the effect of the IV on the dependent variables; (iii) exclusion
    criterion, where the IV does not directly influence the outcome variable. According
    to the three necessary conditions effective IVs should satisfy, in Equation (1),
    “distance from the village to the nearest highway” (DTH) and “whether the village
    is in Chongqing” (CQ) are adopted as IV for LMIGRATION. The main reasons are summarized
    in the following: First, DTH and CQ are geographic variables that are naturally
    exogenous to changes in climatic characteristics, natural conditions, and the
    humanistic society of the village; therefore, it can meet the independence criterion
    of effective IV. Second, DTH and CQ reflect the convenience associated with conducting
    economic activities. Chongqing is a central city in southwest China; therefore,
    a village in Chongqing is considered close to a large market center. A short distance
    to the next highway makes it more convenient for rural residents to travel from
    their village to an economically active region. Thus, it is much easier for rural
    labor in these locations to flow outwards. Therefore, DTF and CQ may directly
    affect LMIGRATION, and can meet the correlation criterion of effective IV. Third,
    on the one hand, the residents of rural areas who live closer to a highway may
    rely on their transportation advantages to obtain more income; therefore, these
    villagers may have sufficient funds for FURT, thereby improving the level of FURT.
    However, this increase in agricultural income may also increase the opportunity
    cost for farmers to trade their farmland, thus restricting the development of
    FURT. Therefore, there is no direct theoretical connection between the instrumental
    variable DTH and the dependent variable FURT; however, DTH indirectly affects
    FURT by affecting the economic strength of the village. On the other hand, the
    survey data and various statistical yearbooks show that the topography of Chongqing
    is very complex, including plains in which FURT is easily carried out, but also
    mountains and hills in which it is difficult to carry out FURT. Therefore, theoretically,
    there is no direct correlation between the instrumental variable CQ and the dependent
    variable FURT, but CQ indirectly affects FURT through geomorphic features. Based
    on the summary of the possible channels through which DTH and CQ affect FURT,
    and in reference to the method utilized by Gabriel et al. (2022), in this paper,
    the economic strength and topography of the village are controlled in the control
    variables (see Table 3), so that the selected instrumental variables better satisfy
    the exclusion criterion. Data on DTH and CQ are extracted using ArcGIS software
    by matching the spatial distribution of highways with the spatial location of
    villages based on the National Catalogue Service for Geographic Information. In
    Equations (2), (3), the log of “latitude of the village” (lnXAS) and “whether
    the village is located in the northern arid and semi-arid region” (NASR) are taken
    as instrumental variables for FURT, mainly on the following grounds: First, lnXAS
    and NASR are geographic variables that are naturally exogenous to changes in climatic
    characteristics, natural conditions, and the humanistic society of the village;
    therefore, they can meet the independence criterion of effective IV. Second, lower-latitude
    regions in China have a higher proportion of hills than higher-latitude plain
    regions; therefore, the negotiation cost of FURT in low-latitude hilly regions
    is far higher than in high-latitude plain regions. Therefore, latitude may directly
    be related to FURT. Moreover, FURT is influenced by the region’s climate and the
    types of crops cultivated. Therefore, whether the village is located in the northern
    arid and semi-arid region may have a direct impact on FURT. In short, the selected
    IV of lnXAS and NASR can meet the correlation criterion of effective IV. Third,
    on the one hand, villages in high latitudes have fewer water resources, and farmers
    are more willing to supply and maintain public irrigation infrastructures to control
    water use costs. Hence, in these villages, the formulation of water resource allocation
    rules and the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure are usually high. Moreover,
    the villages in low latitudes in China are deeply influenced by the clan culture,
    and the institutions inside villages are more restrictive for villagers; consequently,
    people rarely employ free-riding behavior in maintaining public irrigation infrastructure
    and formulating irrigation management rules. Therefore, infrastructure supply
    is also likely to be good in low-latitude villages. There may be no direct relationship
    between the IV of lnXAS and the dependent variables of public infrastructure (including
    MAINTAIN and CONFLICT), but it indirectly affects public infrastructure through
    water resources and socioeconomic attributes. On the other hand, the average annual
    precipitation in northern arid and semi-arid regions is relatively low. Villages
    in this area may either increase the supply of public irrigation infrastructure
    because of water scarcity, or lower the demand for water resources because of
    the cultivation of more drought-tolerant crops, thereby reducing the demand for
    irrigation public infrastructure supply. Therefore, there is no direct relationship
    between NASR and public infrastructure, but the supply of public infrastructure
    is indirectly affected by the condition of water resources and the degree of dependence
    on these. Based on the summary of the possible paths for lnXAS and NASR to affect
    public infrastructure, and in reference to the method provided by Gabriel et al.
    (2022), in this paper, two types of factors are controlled. These are village
    water resource and socioeconomic attributes in the control variables to ensure
    that the selected instrumental variables can better satisfy the exclusion criterion.
    Data on lnXAS and NASR are extracted using ArcGIS software by matching the spatial
    distribution of highways with the spatial location of villages based on the National
    Catalogue Service for Geographic Information. 6. Results Table 4 shows the results
    of instrumental variable estimation for Equations (1), (2), (3). To test the validity
    of the instrumental variable, the first-stage regression of 2SLS is used to test
    the correlation between the instrumental variables and the core independent variables.
    The statistical values of the F-test of Equation (1), Equation (2), and Equation
    (3) are 10.274, 10.120, and 10.077, respectively, which satisfies the empirical
    rule that the statistical value of the first-stage F-test should exceed 10 (Wooldridge,
    2009). This result indicates that the instrumental variables correlate well with
    the corresponding core independent variables, and there is no weak instrumental
    variable problem. To verify whether the instrumental variable is uncorrelated
    with the stochastic disturbance term, the p-values of the Sargan statistic obtained
    by the over-identification test for all instrumental variables all exceeded 0.1.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis that all instrumental variables are exogenous was
    not rejected. Furthermore, the dependent variables were regressed with corresponding
    instrumental variables, while controlling for the channel of the potential influence
    of instrumental variables on the dependent variables. The result showed that instrumental
    variables did not exhibit a statistically significant direct effect on the dependent
    variables, indicating that instrumental variables do not directly affect the dependent
    variables. The detailed testing process of the selected instrumental variables
    is presented in Appendix B. Table 4. Instrumental variable (IV) estimation results.

    *** p < 0.01. Model 1 demonstrates the nonlinear relationship between LMIGRATION
    and FURT. The estimation results show that the quadratic coefficient of LMIGRATION
    is negative and statistically significant, indicating a significant inverted U-shaped
    relationship between labor outmigration and FURT. At a moderate level of labor
    outmigration, labor outmigration can promote FURT; if labor outmigration exceeds
    a specific limit, continuing to promote labor outmigration will inhibit FURT.
    Therefore, hypothesis H1 is proved. Models 2 and 3 present evidence for the nonlinear
    relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply. The estimation results
    show that in Equations (2), (3), the quadratic coefficients of FURT are both negative
    and statistically significant. This indicates that there is a significant inverted
    U-shaped relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply, i.e., under
    a moderate FURT scale, the development of FURT will promote the supply of public
    infrastructure; if FURT exceeds a particular scale, continuing to promote FURT
    will be detrimental to the supply of public infrastructure. Therefore, hypothesis
    H2 is proved. Table 5 shows the results of bootstrap interval estimation for the
    coefficients of each variable in Equation (4) based on instrumental variable estimations
    obtained through Equations (1), (2), and (3). Specifically, bootstrap interval
    estimation was performed on the coefficients of and the constant term in Equation
    (4), respectively. The estimation results show that the coefficient of s negative
    and significant at the 95 % confidence interval; the coefficient of s positive
    but not included in the significant interval; the coefficient of s not included
    in the significant interval; and the coefficient of the constant term is negative
    but not included in the significant interval. The above results show that, in
    the situation represented by the samples tested in this paper, the nonlinear impact
    of labor outmigration on FURT will further affect the supply of public infrastructure
    and the robustness of the rural social-ecological system through the nonlinear
    relationship between FURT and public infrastructure supply. The mediating effect
    of labor outmigration affecting the rural social-ecological system through FURT
    is embodied as a four-order nonlinear effect. Therefore, there are at most four
    possible paths through which labor outmigration can affect the supply of public
    infrastructure through FURT. Hypothesis H3 is proved. Table 5. Estimation of the

    Note: Bootstrap = 10,000. 7. Analysis of the interaction between the internal
    operational processes and the collective-choice processes of the rural social-ecological
    system under the impact of urbanization The above empirical test results show
    that in the survey sample explored in this paper, there is indeed a mechanism
    of how labor outmigration affects the robustness of the social-ecological system
    through FURT, and there are four specific influence paths at most. By comparing
    the empirical test results with data and field investigation records from the
    survey of sample villages in China, all four operational-level influence paths
    shown in Figure 5 exist. After 2016, the research team continued to conduct surveys
    and information tracking in the rural areas where surveyed villages are located.
    Irrigation commons that achieve benign results at the operational level were found
    to consistently exhibit good robustness. Furthermore, not all irrigation systems
    that failed to attain benign results at the operational level collapsed; indeed,
    there were certain cases where more significant improvements in robustness were
    achieved. This suggests that the operational processes of the rural social-ecological
    system in response to the impact of urbanization is only one aspect of the rural
    reality. In the internal interaction of the rural social-ecological system, the
    interaction between the operational processes and the collective-choice processes
    ultimately determines the robustness of the social-ecological system. 7.1. Interaction
    between operational processes and collective-choice processes in benign paths
    7.1.1. Interactions under path ab The characteristic of path ab is that labor
    outmigration will promote FURT, and the development of FURT will further promote
    the supply of public infrastructure and the robustness of the irrigation commons.
    Under these circumstances, more centralized farmland management, better hardware
    facilities, and more complete rules for resource use will let the middle-class
    farmers and farmers’ economic organizations who cultivate concentrated contiguous
    farmland begin to change from facilitators of collective actions to providers
    of collective-choice rules. To better realize intensive farming cultivation, middle-class
    farmers and farmers’ economic organizations will have more incentives to provide
    irrigation facilities and maintain irrigation rules. In villages in China’s Anhui,
    Jiangsu, and Sichuan regions, the behaviors of middle-class farmers and farmers’
    economic organizations that are beneficial to the supply of public infrastructure
    ensure that the people living in rural social-ecological systems can still obtain
    sufficient sources of livelihood from water and land resources. Thus, the rural
    social-ecological system maintains a benign circle of robustness. 7.1.2. Interactions
    under path cd The characteristic of path cd is that labor outmigration will inhibit
    FURT. However, a decrease in the scale of FURT will instead promote the supply
    of public infrastructure, and thus, the outmigration of labor will generally promote
    the robustness of the irrigation commons. Under these circumstances, excessive
    population outmigration and FURT in a short period will make people pay more attention
    to the social security function of their farmland; therefore, they tend to keep
    farmland themselves rather than engage in FURT. As a result, although the supply
    of irrigation public infrastructure can be maintained under such circumstances,
    people no longer tend to engage in FURT at this time, leading such a virtuous
    circle to be reflected in a low-level equilibrium with the economies of scale
    and low-income level of farmers. How can social-ecological systems overcome of
    this seemingly inescapable trap of low-level equilibrium under the impact of urbanization?
    In recent years, in Shandong, Henan, Heilongjiang, and certain other regions in
    China, the answer to this question suggests that people realize the supply of
    irrigation public infrastructure and more economical farmland management by promoting
    the socialized service of agricultural production (Zang et al., 2021). Agricultural
    socialization service is a process in which farmers entrust a particular link,
    part of a certain link, or even all links in the farmland management process to
    agricultural socialization service organizations for management, and therefore
    have no need to engage in FURT (Zang et al., 2022). The farmland management services
    provided by agricultural socialization service organizations can enable more people
    to go out to work and obtain higher income without losing the social security
    function of their farmland and without affecting the supply of public irrigation
    infrastructure in the irrigation commons. Under these circumstances, both large-scale
    farmland operation and an increase in household income can be realized. The emergence
    of this option conforms to the labor outmigration trend induced by urbanization
    and achieves a high-level balance of the social-ecological system. 7.2. Interaction
    between operational processes and collective-choice processes in negative paths
    7.2.1. Interactions under path bc The characteristic of path bc is that labor
    outmigration will promote FURT, but the development of FURT will inhibit the supply
    of irrigation public infrastructure. Thus, labor outmigration will generally damage
    the robustness of irrigation commons. Public infrastructure declines with labor
    outmigration in this path because excessive large-scale farmland management may
    unsettle the rural farmland’s household operation, which provides the foundation
    of effective farmland operation in China. Consequently, the middle-class farmer
    and village relationship network on which the formation of irrigation collective
    action depends are destroyed, leading to a decline in irrigation public infrastructure
    supply levels. To reverse the negative impact of this path on the robustness of
    the irrigation commons, it is necessary to restrain people’s excessively high
    willingness to engage in FURT under labor outmigration. This involves the need
    for resource users to learn to reconcile and balance personal interests of pursuing
    farmland use rights trading with the overall interests of rural social-ecological
    systems that must control FURT to ensure robustness. Therefore, the need to resolve
    the contradiction between the individual interests of farmers and the collective
    interests of rural areas make it necessary for the rural social-ecological system
    to cultivate public infrastructure providers who are capable of handling the contradiction
    between resource users and resources. These can either be individuals with coordination
    capabilities or organizations with conflict-handling capabilities. Such individuals
    or organizations can encourage people to incorporate a reduction of FURT into
    their individual decision-making. In villages where large-scale FURT weakened
    collective action capacity, such public infrastructure providers may no longer
    be supplied through the operating mechanism of the rural social-ecological system
    itself. Therefore, external activation, or external injection, must be used to
    achieve the supply of collective-choice rules under this path. In China, especially
    after the announcement of the implementation of a comprehensive rural revitalization
    strategy in 2017, the central government has begun to enhance long-term public
    policies such as the first secretary stationing in the village, village doctors
    and village teachers joining the village committee, and designating entrepreneurial
    village officials for villages with development difficulties. The goal of these
    public policies is to inject and supplement public infrastructure providers through
    external force, thereby providing options for destructive operations in the social-ecological
    system to change to benign operations. Consequently, these measures ensure that
    the rural social-ecological system can ultimately remain robust under the impact
    of urbanization 7.2.2. Interactions under path de The characteristics of path
    de are that the outmigration of labor will inhibit FURT, and the decline in the
    scale of FURT will further inhibit the supply of public infrastructure. The reason
    why this path will lead to the loss of the robustness of the irrigation commons
    under the impact of urbanization is that large-scale labor outmigration makes
    the social security function of the farmland more and more prominent. This increased
    prominence will tend to let people’s decisions on whether to trade their farmland
    use rights become more cautious. Thus, the promotion effect of moderate-scale
    FURT on irrigation collective action is inhibited, ultimately negatively affecting
    the supply of irrigation public infrastructure and the robustness of the irrigation
    commons. To reverse the negative impact of this path, people in the social-ecological
    system must be provided with more choices in terms of survival security, and the
    status quo that people use the farmland as their only source of social security
    must be changed. It is necessary to obtain such collective-choice rules directly
    from the public sector outside the rural social-ecological system. Consequently,
    when people face existential risks induced by labor outmigration, they can trade
    their farmland use rights continuously because there are more ways to resist imposed
    risks, thus realizing the benign development of the rural social-ecological system.
    After announcing the implementation of a comprehensive rural revitalization strategy
    in 2017, the Chinese central government has issued many public policies yearly
    to ensure social welfare, production, and livelihood of residents living in rural
    areas according to the specific situation of the year (Wang and Zheng, 2021).
    This is indeed a process of continuously supplying the survival guarantee rules
    to provide people with more survival options and, finally, ensure the robustness
    of the rural social-ecological system. 7.3. The essential reason for the robustness
    of rural areas—interaction between operational processes and collective-choice
    processes Figure 7 summarizes the mechanism and processes through which the rural
    social-ecological system can achieve robustness under the impact of urbanization.
    Table 6 is designed to specifically explain the interaction between the operational
    processes and the collective-choice processes shown in Figure 7. On the one hand,
    the paths ab and cd (which produce positive results in the operational processes)
    can realize the internal interaction process, including automatic promotion of
    the operational processes to the collective-choice processes, and automatic guarantee
    of the collective-choice processes for the operational processes. Therefore, the
    operational processes leading to positive results realize the automatic robustness
    cycle of the rural social-ecological system under the impact of urbanization.
    On the other hand, in the paths bc and de, where the operation processes produce
    negative results, the interaction between operational processes and the collective-choice
    process is often broken. This means that the operational processes cannot promote
    the generation of the collective-choice processes by themselves. The ability to
    obtain the corresponding collective-choice rules from outside of the rural social-ecological
    system has become key to achieving the robustness of the rural social-ecological
    system under the impact of urbanization under the path of negative results in
    operational processes. Download : Download high-res image (264KB) Download : Download

    rules to rural social-ecological systems through external activation and injection.
    The public sector complements the collective-choice rules for social-ecological
    systems by guaranteeing rural residents'' social welfare and production and living
    conditions. Linkage 2 The new PIPs provide people with new options to trade their
    farmland use rights to middle-class farmers and farmers'' economic organizations,
    allowing more people to work outside. The emergence of new PIPs enables people
    to work out to obtain higher income without losing the social security function
    of farmland and realize the benefits of large-scale farmland operation, making
    it possible for resource users to continue to work outside. Make reducing FURT
    a viable option for the resource users. Increasing the means of resource users
    to resist the risk of unemployment, thus makes FURT a viable option for resource
    users. Therefore, based on the results presented in Figure 7 and Table 6, it can
    be explained why certain rural areas can achieve robustness under the impact of
    urbanization, while others decline and collapse. Specifically, for rural areas
    whose social-ecological system remains robust under the impact of urbanization,
    on the one hand, they may be on the path to realizing self-regulation and self-robustness
    of the rural social-ecological system. Therefore, under self-regulating mechanisms,
    such as the market mechanism, these rural social-ecological systems can achieve
    automatic adjustment and maintenance of robustness. On the other hand, rural areas
    that cannot achieve positive results at the operational level can achieve robustness
    under the impact of urbanization by having collective-choice rules imposed from
    the outside. For villages whose social-ecological system eventually collapsed
    under urbanization, the village has often no choice but to decline because of
    a lack of collective-choice rules. Independent of whether collective-choice processes
    are automatically generated from within the rural social-ecological system or
    obtained from the outside, as long as the collective-choice processes guarantee
    and improve operational processes, the rural social-ecological system can maintain
    robustness under the impact of urbanization. In contrast, when operational processes
    cannot automatically generate collective-choice processes and external forces
    cannot supplement them, operational processes that cannot produce good results
    face a situation where villagers have no choice but to move towards negative outcomes.
    Based on the above discussion, the reasons for the success or failure of rural
    areas impacted by urbanization can be summarized: the existence of an interaction
    between the operational processes and the collective-choice processes in the rural
    social-ecological system, especially the existence of a guarantee and improvement
    of the operational processes by the collective-choice processes. 8. Conclusions,
    implications, and limitations 8.1. Conclusions By taking China’s farmland irrigation
    commons as example, in this paper, the complex process of how the rural social-ecological
    system interacts internally under the impact of urbanization to achieve the robustness
    is analyzed using the CIS framework. This study found that under the impact of
    urbanization, the process of the rural social-ecological system responding to
    the impact of urbanization can be divided into two parts: operational processes
    and collective-choice processes. Among them, the nonlinear interaction between
    resource users and resources in the rural social-ecological system, as well as
    the nonlinear impact of the interaction between resource users and resources on
    the public infrastructure supply, generates two categories of internal interaction
    paths when the rural social-ecological system responds to external shocks at the
    operational level. These two paths refer to the path that may let the rural social-ecological
    system continue to maintain its robustness and the path that may lead to its collapse
    under the impact of urbanization. Therefore, based on the specific practice for
    China, this paper further analyzes the interaction between the operational process
    that can produce positive results and the collective-choice process, and the interaction
    between the operational process that cannot produce positive results and the collective-choice
    process. The findings highlight that it is key to provide institutional rules
    to guarantee operational processes through the collective-choice process, thus
    ensuring the robustness of the rural social-ecological system under the impact
    of urbanization. 8.2. Theoretical implications Existing literature has explored
    the impact of urbanization on rural economic and society from different perspectives.
    Conclusions indicate that urbanization can promote rural development while discussions
    suggest that urbanization may lead to rural decline. Prior research also pointed
    out that under the impact of urbanization, rural areas must adjust the function
    and structure of the internal components of rural communities to adapt to external
    changes (Li & Liu, 2019). However, the specific process of internal change of
    rural area under external impact has been discussed rarely. This study absorbed
    the conclusions of existing research on the urbanization affects rural areas and
    systematically analyzed the comprehensive process of how urbanization affects
    rural areas. Ultimately, from the perspective of the interaction between operational
    rules and collective selection rules, this paper addresses the question why urbanization
    will cause certain rural areas to continue to maintain robustness, while others
    gradually decline. This further enriches people’s understanding of rural development
    against the shock of urbanization. It is worth mentioning that in our analysis
    of internal interactions within the irrigation system, we have observed that the
    system is able to maintain the livelihoods and standard of living of its inhabitants
    in the face of external shocks through the interplay of operating rules and collective
    choice rules. Existing literature underscores the significance of these interactions
    in maintaining the long-term robustness of resource systems for villages dependent
    on various resources, such as tourism (Su et al., 2022), fishery (Satria & Matsuda,
    2003), forestry (Singh et al., 2011, Epstein, 2017), and rangeland (Hausner et
    al., 2012). Thus, in villages dependent on other resources, our research questions
    remain informative and our findings remain explanatory. The literature that applied
    the CIS framework to discuss the robustness of the social-ecological system mostly
    employed qualitative analysis(Pérez et al., 2011, Kluvánková and Gežík, 2016).
    By using survey data, econometric model, and mediating effect test, in this paper,
    the mechanisms of action among internal components in the social-ecological system
    are empirically examined. These processes provide references for the quantitative
    analysis of the robustness of social social-ecological systems based on the CIS
    framework. Therefore, this paper also further reflects that the CIS framework
    can be applied to different research methods, thus providing a more solid base
    for other analyses on social-ecological systems. Existing studies on rural development
    suggest that rural development can only be realized after combining “bottom-up”
    local forces and “top-down” external forces(Crescenzi, 2016). However, there is
    currently a lack of systematic research on why such an integration of internal
    and external forces can promote rural development. By discussing the interactive
    relationship between the operational and collective-choice processes in rural
    social-ecological systems, this paper provides a more reasonable explanation on
    why internal and external integration can promote rural development. In addition,
    from a methodology perspective, based on the fundamental principle proposed by
    Hayes Andrew and Preacher (2010), in this paper, the test of mediating effect
    composed of two groups of nonlinear relations is explored. This provides an empirical
    reference for other related studies involving complex mediation effect relationships.
    8.3. Political implications Existing literature has pointed out that rural labor
    outmigration caused by urbanization negatively impacts the rural social-ecological
    system (Su et al., 2020). This has led to growing concern about whether irreversible
    rural labor outmigration means that rural areas will inevitably decline (Liu et
    al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2019). In this paper, a more systematic analysis is conducted,
    showing that the impact of urbanization does not necessarily lead to the collapse
    and decline of the rural social-ecological system. Through the interaction between
    operational process and collective-choice processes inside the rural social-ecological
    system, the mechanism of how the rural social social-ecological system maintains
    its robustness under the objective and inevitable impact of urbanization is uncovered.
    This theoretically dispels concern that labor outmigration will have a continuous
    negative impact on rural areas and also provides a theoretical basis for developing
    countries to achieve rural revitalization under the irreversible wave of urbanization.
    Existing studies on the impact of urbanization on rural development often regard
    rural areas as passive recipients of external impact. However, in this paper,
    it is shown that to cope with the impact of urbanization, the rural social-ecological
    system will carry out the active process of adjustment, which reflects the initiative
    of rural areas under external impact. This enables relevant departments to formulate
    public policies to promote rural development and include the autonomy of the rural
    area in the policy guidance category. Thus, the financial pressure the public
    sector experiences and the governance burden in the process of rural revitalization
    may be significantly reduced. 8.4. Limitations Because of limitations of data
    availability and other objective reasons, this study has deficiencies. First,
    the rural social-ecological system is a highly complex system, in which the irrigation
    commons based on the farmland and water nexus is only one component. In the future,
    other subsystems of the rural social-ecological system should be studied to verify
    the reliability of the conclusions obtained in this paper. Second, from a theoretical
    perspective, the operational processes of the rural social-ecological system in
    response to the impact of urbanization should contain a situation where the influence
    paths that affect robustness change correspondingly over time. For example, with
    the continuous change of time, labor outmigration will gradually increase; therefore,
    the influence path that affects robustness in the rural social-ecological system
    may change from the original path ab to the path bc, or even to the path de. However,
    because cross-section data are mainly used in this paper, it is difficult to fully
    consider the changes in the path over time. Future research can systematically
    study the changes in the influence paths of rural social-ecological systems through
    time-series data that can reflect changes over time. Finally, this study has not
    incorporated an in-depth discussion of the changes in the resource subsystem.
    Future studies can include the corresponding changes in the resource system into
    the analysis to discuss the robustness of the rural social-ecological system under
    the impact of urbanization more comprehensively. CRediT authorship contribution

    affects the robustness of rural social-ecological systems through farmland use
    rights trading. This addendum was compiled during an extended discussion with
    the reviewer. This appendix tentatively presents certain forms, but not all, of
    the possible ways through which labor outmigration may affect the robustness of
    rural social-ecological systems through FURT. If labor outmigration, FURT, public
    infrastructure supply, and their interrelations are further defined, more possible
    paths will be obtained. As soon as possible, it becomes clear that no matter how
    diverse the forms of influence paths may be, they cannot be explained beyond the
    basic form shown in Figure 3. 1. Examples of other situations that may have four
    possible influence paths: The interpretation of path ab in Fig. A1 is the same
    as that of path ab in Figure 3. Moreover, the interpretation of path bc in Fig.
    A1 is the same as that of path bc in Figure 3, the explanation of path ef in Fig.
    A1 is the same as that of path cd in Figure 3, and the interpretation of path
    fg in Fig. A1 is the same as that of path de in Figure 3. The difference between
    Fig. A1 and Figure 3 is the existence of the path represented by the line cde
    in Fig. A1. This path can be divided into two paths: On the one hand, in the explanation
    about path cd, this path shows that labor outmigration via FURT does not affect
    the robustness of the social-ecological system. Although the increase in the degree
    of labor outmigration can promote FURT, at this time, FURT has already deteriorated
    the supply of public infrastructure to a level that cannot further deteriorate,
    i.e., the level of zero supply. Therefore, although the path segment cd is also
    reflected in the case where FURT has no effect on the supply of public infrastructure
    from the perspective of image performance, in fact, it still represents the stage
    when the promotion of FURT imposes a negative effect on the supply of public infrastructure.
    However, numerically, it is impossible to assign a positive number smaller than
    0. Therefore, the interpretation of path cd is the same as that of path bc in
    Fig. A1. The interpretation of the two paths bc and cd in Fig. A1 is the same
    as path bc in Figure 3. On the other hand, in the explanation about path de, the
    interpretation is that because of the severe deterioration of public infrastructure
    in path cd, when FURT begins to promote public infrastructure, the social-ecological
    system itself needs a certain recovery period. In reality, this situation shows
    that it takes time to reorganize institutions, establish systems, and purchase
    materials. Therefore, although path de is also reflected in the image that the
    FURT does not affect the supply of public infrastructure, from a practical perspective,
    path de belongs to the stage where the promotion of FURT enhances the supply of
    public infrastructure. However, in reality, the public infrastructure in rural
    areas needs a certain amount of preparation time to move from the stage of extreme
    deterioration to the stage of improvement. Therefore, the interpretation of path
    de is the same as that of path ef in Fig. A1. The interpretation of the two paths
    de and ef in Fig. A1 is the same as that of path cd in Figure 3. In summary, the
    possible paths through which labor outmigration affects the robustness of rural
    social-ecological systems through FURT as shown in Fig. A1 are consistent with
    the possible paths presented in Figure 3. 2. Examples of situations that may have
    three possible influence paths: Fig. A2 is a further variant of Figure 3. The
    explanation for Fig. A2 is the same as that for Figure 3. The difference between
    Fig. A2 and Figure 3 is that, compared with Figure 3, the interval represented
    by Fig. A2 has already reached the upper limit of labor outmigration. Therefore,
    when the level of labor outmigration reaches the position corresponding to point
    d, labor outmigration cannot continue. Consequently, in Fig. A2, there are only
    three possible paths through which labor outmigration can affect the robustness
    of rural social-ecological systems through FURT. In the three paths shown in Fig.
    A2, path ab is the same as the interpretation of path ab in Figure 3, path bc
    is the same as the interpretation of path bc in Figure 3, and path cd is the same
    as the interpretation of path cd in Figure 3. 3. Examples of situations that may
    have two possible influence paths: In the case shown in Fig. A3Aa and Ab, there
    are only two ways through which labor outmigration can affect collective action
    through FURT. The situation represented in Fig. A3Aa in the appendix is that labor
    outmigration promotes the formation of rural irrigation collective action by increasing
    the scale of FURT, and labor outmigration weakens rural irrigation collective
    action by decreasing the scale of FURT. In reality, the reason for this may be
    that the land economic effect of the region represented in Figure 3 in the appendix
    is not particularly significant in comparison; therefore, the FURT level promoted
    by labor outmigration is limited. The above two paths coincide precisely with
    the paths of ab and de in Figure 3; therefore, the situation represented by Fig.
    A3Aa in the appendix is a combination of the two parts of Figure 3, and its corresponding
    interpretation is the same as that of Figure 3. Fig. A3Ab in the appendix represents
    the situation of the labor force: labor force outmigration has not resulted in
    people''s heightened attention to the social security function of the land. Therefore,
    there is always a positive correlation between labor force outmigration and FURT.
    In reality, this may be because, in the region represented by Figure 3, people
    greatly offset their dependence on the social security function of land through
    the innovation of social security policies. This is equivalent to expanding the
    potential of labor outmigration to promote FURT through institutional innovation
    so that labor outmigration can always be kept at a relatively moderate state (this
    is shown in the image as the apex of the inverted U-shaped curve AB continuously
    moves to the right and exceeds the upper limit of labor outmigration in this region).
    Therefore, driven by the economic function of land, labor outmigration can continuously
    promote FURT in the region represented by Figure 3. Based on this, labor outmigration,
    as shown in Figure 3 in the appendix, will ultimately affect the robustness of
    the rural social-ecological system in two ways: labor outmigration improves the
    robustness of the rural social-ecological system by increasing the scale of FURT,
    and labor outmigration reduces the robustness of the rural social-ecological system
    by inhibiting the degree of FURT. The above two paths coincide entirely with the
    paths between ab and bc in Figure 3; therefore, the situation represented by Figure
    3Ab in the appendix is a combination of the two parts of Figure 3, and its corresponding
    interpretation is the same as in Figure 3. 4. Examples of situations that may
    have one possible influence path: Fig. A4A represents regions where the upper
    limit of labor and farmland is low. Therefore, in the context of urbanization,
    labor outmigration and FURT quickly reach their upper limits. Therefore, it is
    shown that there is only one path ab through which labor outmigration can affect
    the robustness of the rural social-ecological system through FURT. This path is
    consistent with the interpretation of path ab in Figure 3. Download : Download

    B. Test results of instrumental variables 1. Test for the correlation between
    instrumental variables and core independent variables The CMP command in STATA
    13.0 was used for the IV-OPROBIT and IV-PROBIT regressions. To test the validity
    of the instrumental variable, the first-stage regression of 2SLS is used to test
    the correlation between the instrumental variables and the core independent variable
    LMIGRATION and FURT in corresponding equations. The statistical values of the
    Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic are listed in Table B1. All values of the Cragg-Donald
    Wald F statistic exceed 10, which satisfies the empirical rule that the statistical
    value of the first-stage Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic should exceed 10 (Wooldridge,
    2009). This result indicates that the instrumental variables are well correlated
    with the core independent variables. 2. Overidentification test of instrumental
    variables To further verify whether the instrumental variable is uncorrelated
    with the stochastic disturbance term, an overidentification test of all instruments
    is carried out. The test results are presented in Table B1. None of the test results
    reject the null hypothesis that all instrumental variables are exogenous. Table

    of the exclusion criterion of instrumental variables the instrumental variables
    DTH and CQ may indirectly affect the FURT of villages by affecting their economic
    strength and topography. In reference to the method proposed by Gabriel et al.
    (2022), when estimating the direct correlation between the instrumental variables
    and the dependent variable, these two indirect channels were controlled by controlling
    the variables “PROVERTY” and “PLAIN”. This was used to test whether a direct impact
    exists and whether the indirect impact channel has been fully controlled, thereby
    satisfying the exclusion criterion of instrumental variables. Similarly, because
    the instrumental variables lnXAS and NASR may indirectly affect the supply of
    public infrastructure by affecting their water resource and socioeconomic attributes,
    when estimating the direct correlation between the instrumental variables and
    the dependent variables, these three indirect channels are controlled by controlling
    the variables “WATERCONDITION”, “WATERMOD”, “PIW”, “MEIN”, and “DEPENDENCE” to
    verify whether a direct impact exists and whether the indirect impact channel
    has been fully controlled. Through this procedure, the exclusion criterion of
    the instrumental variables can be better satisfied. The test results are listed
    in Table B2. After controlling for the possible channels through which instrumental
    variables may indirectly affect dependent variables, none of the correlations
    between instrumental variables and dependent variables are significant. This indicates
    that there is no direct influence between instrumental variables and the dependent
    variables, while the indirect influence channel has been fully controlled, and
    the exclusion criterion certified. The control variables “PROVERTY”, “PLAIN”,
    “WATERCONDITION”, “WATERMOD”, “PIW”, “MEIN”, and “DEPENDENCE” are detailed in

  description: Water accessibility is necessary for agricultural and socioeconomic
    development in the area. One of the best solutions to the water crisis in the
    Kohat region is to build rainwater harvesting structures (RWH) to collect water
    from local watersheds for artificial groundwater recharge. Our main objective
    was to identify suitable RWH locations in the study area. However, the optimum
    site selection for RWH in regional areas is crucial. In such a case, geospatial
    techniques have revealed decisive in optimum site selection for RWH structures.
    In the current study, we have used GIS-based models like the Analytical Hierarchy
    Process (AHP) and Weight of Evidence (WOE) to identify suitable sites for rainwater
    harvesting. Seven influential parameters, i.e., LULC, rainfall, drainage density,
    slope, lineament density, soil, and lithology, were considered, reclassified,
    and assigned ranks according to literature for analysis to produce potential site
    maps for RWH structures. The findings of the current study indicate that, based
    on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), 44% (1320 km2) of the study area is classified
    as highly suitable for rainwater harvesting, while 40% (1200 km2) is considered
    moderately appropriate, and 16% (470 km2) is deemed unsuitable. In contrast, when
    utilizing the Weight of Evidence (WOE) approach, the high suitability class encompasses
    32% (956.8 km2) of the area, the moderate suitability class covers 43% (1285.7
    km2), and the low suitability class accounts for 25% (748 km2) of the study area.
    The outcome of the current study aims to contribute and assist the planner, manager,
    and officials in finding sites for RWH structures to overcome the water table,
    irrigation demand, and agricultural issues in the study area.

    and RSAHPWOEKohat plateau 1. Introduction Water is one of the foremost valued
    characteristic assets essential for anthropogenic animals and plants and socioeconomic
    expansion (Haile and Suryabhagavan, 2019; Mahmood et al., 2020). Freshwater scarcity
    has become a crucial problem for sustainable development, with communities struggling
    to sustain domestic water needs and challenges in agriculture and industry (He
    et al., 2021, Wahla et al., 2022a, Wahla et al., 2023). Consequently, it is crucial
    to manage freshwater resources carefully (Huang et al., 2019a). The five main
    global factors (water pollution, overuse, changing weather patterns, lack of infrastructure,
    and water scarcity) that are employing compression on the obtainability of safe
    water worldwide are population growth, climate change, quick industrial development,
    and extreme use of ground-water (Tiwari et al., 2018). The global climate change
    has resulted in spatial and temporal variations in precipitation patterns at regional
    and local scales. The occurrence of the dry season, food crises, and unforeseen
    changes in daily events have been seen and are predicted to persist in the future
    (Li et al., 2020). According to Ali et al. (2023), variations in the water cycle
    may impact on the environment and society. Rainfall, a crucial factor, straight
    impacts drought, water supplies and floods (Tariq and Qin, 2023). In recent decades,
    a considerable body of scholarly research has been dedicated to analyzing spatio-temporal
    variability in rainfall patterns. The above studies have consistently demonstrated
    that rainfall characteristics have undergone substantial modifications. Specifically,
    the impact of climate change has been identified as a critical driver behind the
    observed changes, resulting in increased precipitation levels. This alteration
    in rainfall patterns has profound implications for water resources, affecting
    their quality and quantity. Furthermore, the ecosystem is also at risk due to
    these shifts in rainfall patterns (Lin et al., 2023). However, to combat the issue
    of water scarcity, academics worldwide have employed various alternative strategies
    (Esmaeili et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2023). RWH (Rainwater Harvesting) is taking
    one of the innovative, profitable, and environmentally advantageous for the availability
    and accessibility of water while also lowering the threat of flash floods and
    resolving the issue of groundwater exploitation. RWH controls the runoff to store
    water and promote aquifer recharge in the area to boost the groundwater table
    (Lu et al., 2024, Wahla et al., 2022a, Wahla et al., 2022b). It has become a common
    practice in many waters'' scarce areas to enhance these regions'' living standards
    (Bokhari et al., 2023; Felegari et al., 2023; Tariq and Qin, 2023; Yin et al.,
    2023a). The primary challenges encountered in the implementation of RWH technologies
    are closely linked to factors such as fluctuations in precipitation patterns,
    the characteristics of the drainage network, soil qualities, geological conditions,
    vegetation cover, land use and land cover (LULC), as well as innovative approaches
    and socioeconomic circumstances (Mao et al., 2022a, Mao et al., 2022b, Yin et
    al., 2023b). Since 4000 BCE, people have used the RWH method to collect and store
    rainwater from a catchment area and conserve water in a reservoir for daily consumption
    (Sejrup et al., 2001). Several organizations and water-related management agencies
    worldwide are aggressively striving to explore and manage river properties, emphasizing
    RWH as a means of acquiring water supply (Cheng et al., 2023; Jamil et al., 2023;
    Lin et al., 2023; Tariq et al., 2023c). The integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing presents a cutting-edge
    approach to identify potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures. By employing
    machine learning techniques, the system can autonomously recognize and interpret
    patterns in spatial and spectral information, contributing to a more efficient
    and accurate identification of suitable locations for rainwater harvesting structures.
    The synergy of AI, GIS, and Remote Sensing not only enhances the precision of
    site selection but also expedites the decision-making process, allowing for proactive
    and sustainable water resource management strategies. Integrating machine learning
    methods with RWH systems through the utilization of Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP) (Saaty, 1990) and Weight of Evidence (WOE) (Ahmad et al., 2013), offers
    a novel approach to optimize water management strategies. Machine learning algorithms,
    such as decision trees or neural networks, can be employed to analyze historical
    rainfall patterns, climate data, and other relevant variables to predict future
    precipitation trends. AHP serves as a valuable tool in prioritizing the importance
    of different factors influencing rainwater harvesting, allowing for a more informed
    decision-making process (Pande et al., 2021). Additionally, the incorporation
    of WOE facilitates the assessment of uncertainties and provides a statistical
    framework to evaluate the reliability of data in the decision-making model. By
    combining machine learning, AHP, and WOE, one can enhance the efficiency and accuracy
    of rainwater harvesting systems, ultimately contributing to supportable management
    of hydro resources in a climate change (Zhu et al., 2022). The integration of
    machine learning techniques, Frequency Ratio (FR) (Regmi et al., 2014), WOE (Tahmassebipoor
    et al., 2016), Random Forest (RF) (Prasad et al., 2020), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) (Lee et al., 2018), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) (Naghibi et al., 2016),
    Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Lautz et al., 2014), Classification and Regression
    Tree (CART) (Zhao et al., 2024), with RS and GIS and holds profound significance
    in the identification of potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures.
    This interdisciplinary approach harnesses the strengths of each field to address
    water scarcity challenges and promote sustainable water resource organization.
    One of the primary benefits lies in the ability of MLA to examine vast datasets
    derived from RS and GIS (Wu et al., 2022). These technologies provide an extensive
    spatial and temporal understanding of the landscape, including factors such as
    land cover, topography, and precipitation patterns. Machine learning algorithms,
    when applied to these datasets, can uncover complex patterns and relationships
    that may not be readily apparent through traditional methods. This enables a more
    nuanced identification of areas with optimal conditions for rainwater harvesting
    (Zhou et al., 2022). Pakistan has been ranked in the \"red zone\" by the Asian
    Development Bank regarding the effects of urbanization and population growth (Wahla
    et al., 2023). In addition, Pakistan was designated a nation with a water shortage
    in 2007 and a country with a water shortage in 1991 with a 1000 m3/capita accessibility
    (Raza et al., 2023). Pakistan relies heavily on a pronounced seasonal monsoon
    precipitation period; nonetheless, this region is susceptible to flood hazards.
    Moreover, the heightened susceptibility to climatic risks and the projected expansion
    of urban areas have contributed to the worsening of urban flooding in major cities.
    Additional serious challenges include deforestation, poor land use practices,
    and soil erosion from inadequate watershed management. Their actions have resulted
    in the degradation of approximately 65% of infrastructure dedicated to the storage
    and distribution of drinkable water. Consequently, sediments originating from
    productive land have been eroded and deposited into water reservoirs (Zhao et
    al., 2024). The Kohat region also has groundwater stress issues; however, it has
    yet to be investigated thoroughly to identify potential RWH sites to empower policymakers
    to adopt this system to mitigate these critical issues. Several methods have been
    developed for the optimum site selection of RWH structures (Ahmad et al., 2013).
    The most popular technique for small areas is field surveys. Finding suitable
    locations for the various RWH technologies on a regional scale is arduous (Zheng
    et al., 2023). Geospatial technology and techniques are excellent and innovative
    ways to conduct more thorough and accurate analyses in water management research
    for regional-scale investigations (Buraihi and Shariff, 2015). In this perspective,
    geospatial data are applied (Wahla et al., 2022b), Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)
    integrated with GIS (Tariq et al., 2023a), AHP with GIS (Shah et al., 2021), and
    Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and Boolean methods were applied (Mary et al.,
    2023, Tariq et al., 2023c). Tariq (2023) considered precipitation, soil depth,
    soil texture, slope, LULC, and river network as influential parameters to select
    the optimum site for RWH. The purpose of this study is to locate areas in the
    Kohat region of Pakistan that have the potential to accommodate RWH constructions.
    Our current research used rainfall, slope, lithology, Lineament, soil texture,
    drainage network, and LULC as input parameters in the GIS-based AHP and WOE method.
    The main objective of the current research is to identify potential sites for
    the RWH structures in the study area for sustainable development. The results
    of the present research will help policymakers construct check dams, percolation
    tanks, farm ponds, and Nala bunds in the study area. 2. Material and methods 2.1.
    Study area The present study is conducted in District Kohat, in the southern region
    of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, as shown in Fig. 1. The geographic coordinates
    of Kohat are 33° 35′ 13″ North and 71° 26′ 32″ East (Hussain, 2014). The current
    research is situated at an altitude of up to 2000m, as mentioned in Fig. 1. Islam
    et al. (2023) state that the study area has a regional steppe climate with sporadic
    annual precipitation. The Kohat region geologically occurred in the Kohat Plateau,
    with fold and thrust belt structures. The plateau is vulnerable primarily to compressional
    facilities. The southern Kohat plateau is where strike-slip faulting occurs (Hussain
    and Zhang, 2018). The Kohat Plateau is concerned chiefly with the geological formations
    of Eocene limestone, shale, evaporites, subordinate clays, and younger stratified
    rocks of the Miocene–Pliocene age (Hussain et al., 2021). The era of stratified
    strata in the plateau is comprised of Paleocene to Pliocene. Download : Download

    area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, (c) study area with elevation and drainage network.
    The district experiences a predominantly arid to semi-arid climate with limited
    and irregular rainfall. The monsoon season, typically from July to September,
    is the primary period for precipitation. During this time, Kohat may receive moderate
    to heavy rain, contributing to the annual precipitation totals. On average, the
    district gets around 400–600 mm of rainfall annually, with variations in different
    localities. The terrain and topography of the region can influence precipitation
    distribution, with some areas receiving more rain due to their geographical features.
    It''s essential to note that precise precipitation figures can vary yearly, and
    climate conditions may be subject to change. Local meteorological records or government
    weather agencies can provide more accurate and up-to-date information on precipitation
    patterns in District Kohat (Hussain and Zhang, 2018). 2.2. Selection of the data
    layers In this study, we incorporated eight parameters'' including slope, rainfall,
    lithology, lineament density, fault, drainage density, soil, and LULC, as per
    existing literature, to determine the most suitable location for RWH buildings
    in the Kohat region of Pakistan. The present research acquired RS and ground data
    from different open-source satellites in Pakistan, both public and private organizations.
    The details of the data and source are shown in Table 1. The proper national and
    international research platforms were used to obtain the ground and satellite
    data to generate seven influential parameters for the site selection of RWH structures.

    were collected from concerned national and international organizations. In addition,
    the required parameters of the study were prepared from acquired data. Furthermore,
    the parameters were reclassified according to the literature. The factors were
    reclassified according to their significance to RWH, and primary and minor importance
    were determined using the multi-influencing factor equation (1). In contrast,
    the major and minor significance are shown in Table 2 (Selvam et al., 2015). (1)

    was computed in GIS-based AHP. Then, the output weightage was added in weighted
    overlay analysis (WOA) to generate an RWH map of the study area and categorize
    it into three classes, i.e., Low, medium, and high potential classes. Finally,
    the RWH structure (check dam, farm ponds, percolation tank, and Nala bund) site
    was identified using WOA in the ArcGIS 10.8. The thoroughly planned methodology
    for the current research has been displayed in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res

    the comprehensive details for the site selection of RWH structures. 2.3. Preparation
    and collection of data layers The subsequent section provides an overview of the
    process of parameter preparation and its subsequent impact. 2.3.1. Rainfall The
    precipitation parameters are significant factor in surface runoff production (Khan
    et al., 2022). Rainfall is considered to play a substantial role in water recharge
    and is a principal contributor to RWH mapping (Aziz et al., 2023). The precipitation
    map of the present study area is produced from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
    Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) from 2010 to 2023 using Kernel machine
    learning techniques in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The average rainfall in the
    study area during 2010–2023 is 889–1147 mm/year. According to the literature,
    the generated rainfall map was reclassified into five classes in ArcGIS pro, as
    shown in Fig. 3a. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    (d) lineament, (e) fault, (f) soil, (g) drainage (h) LULC. 2.3.2. Slope Slope
    is also important factor in the site selection of RWH structures. High-slope locations
    may not be ideal if much water is required to meet irrigation demand. The storage
    structure may be more expensive (Preeti et al., 2022). The capital expense of
    a storage facility can be reduced more efficiently in a region with a medium to
    low slope (Alwan et al., 2020). Because a higher slope allows for a rapid runoff
    area and reduces water infiltration while a lower slope encourages water infiltration
    and potential recharge areas, a steep slope gradient has a detrimental effect
    on groundwater reservoirs (Kamali Maskooni et al., 2020). The highest slope in
    the present study area is 78°. The slope of the present study is computed from
    SRTM-DEM of 12.5m resolution using the GEE platform and reclassified into five
    classes using ArcGIS pro, as mentioned in Fig. 3b. 2.3.3. Lithology Lithology
    is a vital parameter in groundwater research because it influences the strata''s
    water infiltration by absorbency and absorptivity of beds (Tariq et al., 2023a).
    In actuality, the geological features control the passage of groundwater from
    surface streams to subterranean aquifers and the opposing movement (Khan et al.,
    2022). Fig. 3c depicts the Kohat region''s lithological map, prepared from the
    Northern Geological Map of Pakistan using georeferencing and digitization methods
    in the ArcGIS environment. 2.3.4. Lineament density Lineament is crucial for identifying
    the area''s micro and macro-level tectonic trends. It has a significant role in
    the enhanced performance of structural elements by regulating surface and groundwater
    mobility in the texture and fracture of strata (Maina and Raude, 2016). The present
    research computed the Lineament from the SRTM-DEM hill shades. The calculated
    lineament density was generated using the line density tool in ArcGIS pro. Finally
    reclassified into five classes using the reclassification technique, as shown
    in Fig. 3d. 2.3.5. Fault density Fault density, in the context of land and surface
    features, is crucial in determining the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting
    systems. When assessing areas for rainwater harvesting potential, understanding
    the distribution and intensity of faults is essential. High fault density areas
    can significantly impact rainwater harvesting in several ways. Firstly, fault
    zones may act as preferential pathways for rainwater to infiltrate the ground
    (Islam et al., 2023, Zheng et al., 2023). This can either enhance or hinder rainwater
    harvesting, depending on the permeability of the fault materials. If fault zones
    consist of highly porous materials, they can facilitate rapid groundwater recharge,
    which may reduce surface runoff and make rainwater harvesting more challenging.
    Moreover, fault density can also impact the availability of suitable locations
    for rainwater harvesting infrastructure. High fault density areas may limit the
    installation of rainwater harvesting structures, such as infiltration basins,
    due to the risk of structural damage caused by ground movements associated with
    faults. The fault map was scanned and digitized from the Northern map of Pakistan,
    as shown in Fig. 3e. 2.3.6. Soil It is necessary and essential to have a soil
    map of every watershed to comprehend its land use and geology (Gavit et al., 2018).
    The soil type is a crucial factor when choosing an RWH location to deliver water
    for irrigation (Al-Adamat, 2008). The soil map of the current research is prepared
    from the scanned map of Pakistan''s soil survey by georeferencing and digitization
    methods in ArcGIS 10.8 to extract the region of interest, as mentioned in Fig.
    3f. 2.3.7. Drainage density The drainage pattern reflects the surface characteristics
    and the existing subsurface hydrological structure. It demonstrates the surface
    material''s properties and the channel spacing''s closeness. The region with a
    high-density drainage network will have a high runoff and vice versa (Khudhair
    et al., 2020). RWH site is generally chosen in an area with a high drainage network
    because the water flows through this network fast and is confined (Al-Adamat,
    2008; Fagbohun, 2018). We used 30m DEM in Arc Hydro tool and reclassified in ArcGIS
    pro to extract the drainage density as shown in Fig. 3g. 2.3.8. LULC The land''s
    natural characteristics can be deduced from its land cover, while its purpose
    can be determined from its use. Critical data can be collected using the LULC
    form, which pertains to the spreading of runoff. Compared to bare land and built-up
    regions, which encourage high runoff production, green area linked to higher infiltration
    rates and absorption (Fagbohun, 2018; Hashim and Sayl, 2021). When vegetation
    density rises, runoff volume decreases due to higher interception losses, infiltration,
    and retention rates. The size of the area covered by flora can be used to determine
    vegetation density. Environmental factors presented by LULC substantially impact
    groundwater because they affect surface runoff and penetration (Bui et al., 2019).
    The LULC map of the study area is generated from sentinel-2 imageries using the
    Random Forest machine classifier in the GEE platform and exported to ArcGIS Pro,
    as shown in Fig. 3h. 2.4. Methods 2.4.1. AHP method Groundwater potential zone
    delineation with GIS is commonly achieved by multi-criteria decision analysis
    utilizing the Analytical Hierarchical Process (Hussain et al., 2021; Pande et
    al., 2020). AHP is a mathematical method that considers a challenging decision
    considering various factors (Baghel et al., 2023). The weights for the criterion
    are determined using the AHP technique, which was first proposed by Saaty (1990).
    The consequences for each measure are defined via pairwise comparisons in a matrix
    (Das et al., 2022). When assessing whether two factors are appropriate for a given
    goal, pairwise comparisons establish the relative weights of the two elements.
    Two variables are compared and scored on a continuous 9-point scale, as mentioned
    in Table 3 (Wedley, 1993). Eight parameters were chosen for the AHP evaluation
    based on earlier research and professional judgment. Shared values like 1/3, 1/5,
    1/7, and 1/9 were employed where the column criteria were more important than
    the row norms. 3–9 arbitrary Saaty products were offered in exchange for the opinion.
    The matrices established the consistency of AHP frameworks to incorporate for
    the analysis of potential sites for rainwater collection and were time-planned
    (Omolabi, P. O., & Fagbohun, 2019). Saaty (1990) provided a consistency metric
    known as the Consistency Index (CI) as a deviation or degree of consistency using
    equation (2): (2) where n = number of classes, and max = greatest eigenvalue of
    the pairwise comparison matrix. The consistency of the pairwise comparison matrix
    is measured by the consistency ratio (CR) provided by Equation (3). (3) Where  =
    Consistency Index, and is the Ratio Index. Table 3. The scales of pairwise comparison.

    Extreme 2, 4, 6, 8 Intermediate Values 2.4.2. Weight of Evidence (WOE) The WOE
    approach is a data-driven strategy that uses the Bayesian principle to evaluate
    and compute the strength of the spatial relationship between the training data
    (such as the locations of springs, landslides, and probable groundwater sources)
    and predictor maps (Tahmassebipoor et al., 2016). The WOE approach allows for
    predicting new binary trends by integrating several binary configurations (GF,
    1990). This approach, which primarily uses the Bayesian likelihood concept to
    determine the significance of evidence using quantitative means, has many advantages
    over other forms of statistical analysis because it is data-driven (Falah and
    Zeinivand, 2019). The crucial parameters that must be computed to apply WOE are
    positive weight (W+) and negative weight (W−). This method calculates the weight
    for each class of groundwater precondition parameter''s presence or absence (
    ) based on the absence or presence of the inventory pixels ( ), as stated in (Bull
    and Kirkby, 1997; Gayen and Saha, 2017; GF, 1990), as equations (4), (5)): (4)
    (5) In this scenario, p stands for probability, M for groundwater characteristics,
    M* for groundwater pixels, N for inventory, and N* for well. The weights of the
    evidence are positive weight (W +) and negative weight (W−), respectively, depending
    on whether a component exists or is omitted. 2.4.3. Validation The result of the
    current study is validated using the Area Under Receiving Operating Characteristic
    technique. The AUROC has been used to assess models'' effectiveness and reliability
    (Islam et al., 2022). It represents the quality of probabilistic and deterministic
    detection and forecasting systems (Vu Dinh et al., 2021). It describes a prediction
    system''s quality by indicating how well it can predict the occurrence or non-occurrence
    of pre-defined \"events.\" A quantitative indicator of a model''s quality, the
    area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be classified as poor (0.5–0.6), average (0.6–0.7),
    good (0.7–0.8), very good (0.8–0.9), and excellent (0.9–1) (Chen et al., 2018).
    Using integral calculus''s trapezoidal rule, one may determine the AUC as shown
    in equation (6) (Pontius and Schneider, 2001). (6) where is the AUC and indicates
    1-specificity while indicates sensitivity. 3. Results The concluding findings
    of the current research were achieved using various influential parameters. According
    to our methodology in the present study, the spatial output includes identifying
    potential RWH sites and proposals of relevant major RWH structures, such as check
    dams, percolation tanks, ponds, farm and Nala bunds. Additional analysis comparing
    spatial findings to data from government agencies and field surveys on this region.
    3.1. Optimum potential sites of rainwater harvesting Groundwater alone cannot
    supply all of the area''s water needs. Consequently, the potential locations for
    RWH storage are crucial as options for increased surface water storage (Ramakrishnan
    et al., 2009). Different factors were applied to the current study region to find
    possible RWH locations. Field surveys show excellent potential for RWH regarding
    yearly rainfall patterns, topographic, geologic, and hydrologic factors, etc.
    As a result, we have identified RWH sites as part of our study. The final RWH
    potential map was divided into three zones: low, medium, and high potential zones.
    The final output RWH map of the Kohat region using the AHP (Fig. 4a) and WOA (Fig.
    4b) technique were used to identify RWH structures for the study area. The various
    RWH structures, i.e., Farm ponds, nala bund, percolation tanks, check dams, and
    were placed as shown in Fig. 4c. Download : Download high-res image (924KB) Download

    for RWH. In addition, moderate zones have occupied 1320 km2 and 44.16% region
    of the study area. Furthermore, it was also noticed from the results that 1000.51
    km2 and 33.46% of the Kohat district are highly suitable for RWH using the AHP
    method. According to the WOE model, the high class occupied 32% (956.8 km2), moderate
    43% (1285.7 km2), and low class of RWH occupied 25% (748 km2), as shown in Table

    area''s potential for rainwater collection had been examined, identifying prospective
    RWH structures was a crucial next step. To point out the potential RWH structures,
    we used the required criteria and applied the WOA. The details of the results
    for RWH structures are mentioned in Table 4. Table 4 revealed that 2746.62 km2
    and 93.23% area are not suitable for check dams, while 199.91 km2 and 6.78% are
    suitable for check dams in the study area. The analysis for site selection of
    Farm ponds was performed according to the literature, and the final output map
    was divided into two groups, i.e., suitable and not suitable, using the different
    color schemes as shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, the results illustrated
    that unsuitable zones cover 2870.81 km2 and 96.66% of the region. However, the
    100.16 km2 and 3.37% area is the suitable zone for a potential Farm Pond structure
    in Kohat. The results for the possible sites of RWH structures are mentioned in
    Table 4. The results showed that the unsuitable Nala bund zones had occupied 2606.23
    km2 (93.01%). However, 196.16 km2 and 7% zone region are suitable for Nala Bund
    in Kohat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Table 5. RWH structures area in km2 and

    were analyzed with RWHS, and the association of variables with RWHS was computed.
    The selected parameters were considered according to the literature, and each
    variable has a significant association with RWHS. In this study, the slope is
    the most influential parameter. WOE values for <05°, 05–15°, 15–25°, 25–40° and
    >40° are 2.73, 2.68, 1.53, 0.43 and −0.9 respectively. The results shown in Table
    6 revealed that gentle slope, i.e., <05°, is the most suitable class for RWHS
    and vice versa. The results mentioned in Table 6 illustrate that drainage density
    is the influential parameter in the current research. The results show that the
    drainage density region is suitable for RWHS, while the less dense part of drainage
    is a minor potential class for the RWHS. In the present study, precipitation contributes
    very well to the structure''s development in the area of investigation. Table
    6 explains that the area with more rainfall is suitable for rainwater harvesting
    compared to the region with less precipitation. The results show that >1000 mm/year
    having WOE range is 0.91 while <850 mm/year region have negative association which
    clearly exhibit that it''s unsuitable for RWHS. In the ongoing research, LULC
    was prepared using Sentinel-2 to compute the relationship of each LULC class with
    RWHS. The results in Table 6 comprehensively explain that range and barren land
    have the most potential for RWHS development. In contrast, urban and water classes
    have the most damaging relationship with variables, illustrating that these two
    classes are unsuitable for mentioned structures. In this study, we observed from
    the results shown in Table 6 that fractures and faults adversely impact RWHS.
    The results revealed that the <300 m class negatively correlates with RWHS, followed
    by 500–1000m while the >3000 m class shows a strong positive association with
    RWHS. The results mentioned in Table 6 illustrated that Loamy and shallow soil
    positively correlate with RWHS, while mainly loamy soil shows the slightest relationship
    with RWHS. Table 6. Bivariate analysis WOE model for RWHS in Kohat region, Pakistan.

    GIS and RS analysis will always require ground-based verification to validate
    the output results. After completing the research for RWH, we verified the output
    with existing RWH structures constructed by various organizations in the Kohat
    region. Throughout the survey, we discovered that some rainwater collection solutions
    had previously been built in appropriate locations, but more was required. Areas
    for various water conservation strategies were noted using GPS coordinates to
    verify the results. GPS readings were acquired in proper places and compared to
    already-built interventions. Additionally, various locations were noted for potential
    future rainwater-gathering interventions throughout the physical ground data-based
    survey in the study area. Besides ground-based data validation, we used the AUROC
    technique to check the model''s accuracy by applying the testing dataset. The
    validation results of AHP and WOE are 86% and 91%, respectively, shown in Fig.
    6. The validation results revealed both models performed well, but WOE performed
    very well compared to AHP, as shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image

    scales and units for the AHP and WOE methodologies to be effectively utilized.
    Lineament and stream are two types of vector layers that must be transformed into
    a raster format to facilitate more sophisticated classification techniques. Fig.
    6 shows the research area''s reclassification map and distribution of yearly rainfall
    averages. The rainfall distribution across the research region is displayed on
    a rainfall map, although this does not always mean potential harvesting is concentrated
    there (Zhou et al., 2023). The present study also revealed that some regions have
    less precipitation with high potential RWH sites and vice versa. The precipitation
    map of the study area is mentioned in Fig. 3a. In this research, there are several
    different slopes in the area, ranging from gentle to steep. The slope was categorized
    into five classes, as shown in Fig. 3b. One of the most crucial aspects to consider
    while selecting and implementing RWH structures is the slope, which affects surface
    water runoff, groundwater recharge, and mobility. Adham et al. (2019) show an
    optimal slope is less than 5%. In the current study, 46.73% of potential sites
    for RWH occurred in the flat slope region. The suitability of slope classes for
    rainfall is mentioned in Table 7. This association of slope with rainwater storage
    illustrated that a flat slope (<5°) is the most suitable slope for RWH in the
    current research area. Table 7. Parameters suitability for RWH using AHP. Parameter

    The reclassification map of drainage density is mentioned in Fig. 3g. Higher drainage
    density has a strong positive association with water storage. Therefore, locations
    with higher drainage density are more likely to have RWH (Ammar et al., 2016).
    In this research, drainage density has a strong relationship with RWH. A higher-density
    region is the most suitable for the optimum site selection of RWH. Fig. 4 shows
    the LULC map for the research region and lists the seven major categories: built-up
    areas, waterbodies, trees, scrub/shrub, crops, grass (mixed forest), barren land,
    and flooded vegetation. The reclassification map illustrates how these groups
    are split into five introductory classes based on suitability, as shown in Fig.
    3h. Most of the research area (84.12%) is a Scrub/Shrub and urban region, with
    9.50% crops in the study area followed by water and urban class (5.33%) of LULC
    in the Kohat area. It is frequently recommended to use land-use types like bare
    ground and thinly vegetated land for water harvesting zones and structures (Wu
    et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2022). The results of the present study illustrated that
    water bodies and urban classes occupying around 5.33% should be more appropriate
    for collecting rainwater. It is evident that the scrub/shrub class of LULC, which
    together make up 84.12% of the study territory, is the best place to gather rainwater
    for irrigation (Zhu et al., 2022). The chosen sub-areas for the RWH structure
    were categorized based on their suitability. This was accomplished by weighting
    the suitability classes into the following regions, i.e., low, medium, and high,
    as revealed in Fig. 4a. These places are ranked according to their suitability,
    with 3 representing the ideal zone and 1 representing the unsuitable zone of the
    study area. Fig. 5 shows that the moderately appropriate locations comprised 44%
    of the total area and were most strongly represented in the study area. The lowest-scaled
    regions with 22.40% regional coverage were considered inappropriate for RWH. The
    highest suitable region occupied 33.46% of the whole area. Regarding precipitation,
    slope, lithology, Lineament, soil, drainage density, soil, and LULC, most parts
    received the most attention when identifying the RWH structures (Cheng et al.,
    2023, Huang et al., 2019b). Moreover, integrating machine learning enhances the
    accuracy and efficiency of site selection. Traditional methods often rely on manual
    interpretation of GIS and Remote Sensing data, which can be time-consuming and
    prone to human error. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can rapidly
    process large datasets and autonomously learn from patterns, significantly streamlining
    the identification process (Mokhtar et al., 2021, Yin et al., 2023). This efficiency
    is crucial, especially in regions facing pressing water scarcity issues, where
    timely decision-making is imperative. The predictive capabilities of machine learning
    models also contribute to proactive planning and resource allocation (Tariq et
    al., 2023b). By leveraging historical data and real-time observations from Remote
    Sensing, these models can forecast potential changes in precipitation patterns
    and identify areas susceptible to water stress. This foresight empowers decision-makers
    to implement rainwater harvesting structures preemptively, mitigating the impact
    of droughts and ensuring a more resilient water supply (Thanh Noi and Kappas,
    2017). Furthermore, incorporating machine learning in GIS and Remote Sensing facilitates
    adaptability to changing environmental conditions. As climate patterns evolve,
    machine learning models can continuously update and refine their predictions based
    on new data inputs. This dynamic nature is vital for maintaining the relevance
    and effectiveness of rainwater harvesting initiatives over time (Chen et al.,
    2020). Ultimately, the synergy between machine learning, GIS, and Remote Sensing
    in identifying potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures represents
    a cutting-edge approach to addressing water scarcity challenges. This integrated
    study improves the precision and efficiency of site selection. It empowers decision-makers
    with predictive insights, contributing to sustainable water resource management
    in the face of evolving environmental conditions. 4.1. Limitations Despite the
    efficacy of RWH techniques utilizing AHP and WOE methodologies in water-scarce
    arid and semi-arid regions, certain limitations should be acknowledged. Although
    this inquiry employs a cost-effective scientific approach to analyze many aspects
    of natural resources, it is essential to accept certain limitations. The primary
    constraints are outlined as follows. a. This study''s diverse satellite and field
    data are obtained from satellites provided by multiple agencies and departments.
    Nevertheless, the majority of this map is highly prevalent in rural areas. The
    highest disparity in these variables can be observed locally or on a small scale.
    As a result of this problem, the groundwater potential maps generated could have
    been more accurate at the same local scale. b. AHP is a practical method in which
    the prioritization of criteria is determined based on expertise. Despite the high
    accuracy demonstrated by this research, it is possible to generate a more comprehensive
    map by rearranging the rankings in a unidirectional manner. c. The accuracy of
    MIF and AHP findings is confirmed by comparing them with water level data. However,
    it should be noted that groundwater levels vary from region to region. On the
    other hand, the ROC plot has provided more accurate results at local, international,
    and national levels. d. The sustainable planning and development of groundwater
    have been formulated based on the results of the AHP. However, implementing planning
    for soil and water conservation structures in the field poses a significant challenge.
    e. This inquiry focuses only on AHP, MIF, and RS techniques to assess potential
    groundwater zones and create comprehensive planning maps. Nevertheless, ground
    survey-based geophysical methodologies are highly advantageous for conducting
    precise and dangerous comprehensive valuations. Nevertheless, the process of determining
    groundwater potential zones using ground-based geophysical surveys and field surveys
    is not only costly but also exceedingly time-consuming. 5. Conclusion The current
    study examined the identification of potential zones in the basin utilizing the
    WOE and AHP. This research uses two distinct methodologies to demarcate GWPZ.
    RWH is a practical strategy for controlling water deficiency challenges by boosting
    water availability over the long term. This issue was addressed in the current
    study by utilizing the GIS-based AHP and WOE techniques to identify the potential
    site for RWH in the study area. With the help of the GIS-based AHP and WOE approach,
    we gathered data on the necessary factors (rainfall, slope, lithology, Lineament,
    fault, soil, drainage density, LULC) to design an appropriate dam/reservoir map
    for the study area. The current AHP model study shows that 22.40% of the research
    region needs to be more suitable for RWH. In addition, it is moderately ideal
    for RWH, which contains 44% of the whole study area. Furthermore, 33.46% of the
    study area is distributed throughout the region, which suits RWH. Furthermore,
    according to the results of the WOE model, the high class occupied 32% (956.8
    km2), moderate 43% (1285.7 km2), and the low class of RWH occupied 25% (748 km2)
    of the study area. This study also suggests including other geological, groundwater,
    and meteorological aspects to enhance the outcome. This article examined and established
    a correlation between the two methodologies, determining which technique is most
    suitable for identifying possible groundwater zones. The groundwater potential
    area maps were validated by comparing them with the groundwater depth data using
    the ROC and AUC models. The cross-validation results identified the AHP as a superior
    method (with an accuracy of 86%) for delineating possible groundwater zones in
    the basin area. The cross-validation results indicate that the WOE method is moderately
    effective, with an accuracy of 91%, for extracting groundwater potential maps
    in the area. The outcome of the current research will help the decision-makers
    and authorities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa emphasize their long-term development plans
    for handling water scarcity in the Kohat region. The established methodology of
    the present research can be used on a national and international level for terrain
    with similar characteristics. Funding This research was funded by the Researchers

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The

    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are

    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).

    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every
    irrigated acre-inch (Table 4). These costs are strictly related to the center
    pivot movement when watering. Table 4. Cost analysis for center pivot installation:

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: This study evaluates the groundwater potential and quality in the parts
    of Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex situated in the East Indian Shield. The region
    has faced groundwater development challenges for several decades. Therefore, in
    the study area, it is crucial to address the depletion of both groundwater quality
    and quantity, as this facilitates the identification of potential uncontaminated
    groundwater zones. The present study interprets the groundwater potential zones
    (GWPZ) utilizing an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) integrated with hydrogeochemical
    analysis. Several thematic maps were prepared to delineate the GPWZ. It has been
    found that ∼0.6% of the study area has a very good potential zone, 14.4% has good,
    52% has moderate, and approximately 32% and 0.9% have low to very low prospective
    groundwater resources, respectively. The authentication of results was found to
    be excellent (91.4%) with the Area Under Curve (AUC). Analysis of hydrogeochemical
    data suggests that Mixed Ca–Na–HCO3, Mixed Ca–Mg–Cl, Ca–HCO3, and Na–Cl are the
    dominant water types in the study area. The principal component analysis suggests
    that Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, NO3−, and SO42− significantly contribute to groundwater chemistry.
    The K-means clustering and hierarchical cluster analysis classified groundwater
    samples into three clusters based on the hydrogeochemical characteristics. It
    is inferred that silicate weathering and reverse ion reactions through rock-water
    interaction control geogenic processes for groundwater chemistry. It is also inferred
    that regions with poor to unsuitable water quality indexes also have low GWPZ.
    Further, groundwater for irrigation is also accessed and found unsuitable at some
    locations. This research contributes to comprehending groundwater characteristics
    in analogous geological regions globally. Additionally, it assists in implementing
    preventive actions to mitigate groundwater contamination, consequently lowering
    health risks and formulating sustainable plans for the future.

    statistical analysis 1. Introduction Globally, the increasing population is posing
    greater challenges to the availability of freshwater (Kadam et al., 2019; Senthilkumar
    et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021). Freshwater accounts for 1% of the total hydrosphere
    (Chow et al., 1988; Gleick, 1993; Kumar, 2022), with surface and groundwater serving
    as primary sources (31.3%) for various freshwater needs. Most freshwater is trapped
    in glaciers and ice sheets (68.7%), which, although abundant, is not readily available
    for immediate use. Freshwater availability is sharply decreasing worldwide, mostly
    in over-populated countries like China, U.S.A., India, etc. (Kumar et al., 2018;
    Paul et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2020). It is used for various purposes, such as
    domestic, industrial, and irrigation (Li et al., 2018; Su et al., 2020; Wang et
    al., 2020; Arivazhagan et al., 2021; Rajesh et al., 2021), and its unrestricted
    demand threatened the groundwater resources qualitatively and quantitatively(Fathi
    et al., 2021; Gautam et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c). Poor agriculture methods, irregular
    monsoons, and improper sustainable practices contaminate freshwater (Rao et al.,
    2022a, Rao et al., 2022b). Moreover, the decrease in groundwater levels contributes
    to the increasing concentrations of geogenic contaminants such as fluoride, arsenic,
    etc. (Raju, 2006; Qian et al., 2020). The adverse consequences of increasing demand
    for potable water led to its massive depletion and may pose a potential cause
    for future global conflicts, as anticipated by the United Nations in 2004. Thus,
    it is essential to comprehend the hazards associated with groundwater and to discover
    new reserves. The groundwater reserve is invisible, and the indirect method of
    mapping and interpretation makes its estimation challenging (Kumar et al., 2023a,
    Kumar et al., 2023b). It also requires a careful and detailed evaluation, especially
    in arid and semi-arid regions (Gautam et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c). Therefore,
    delineating groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) is highly crucial to meet public
    demands while optimizing the utilization of available groundwater resources (Etikala
    et al., 2019; Patle et al., 2022; Paul et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021). The
    factors such as lithology, geomorphology, drainage, lineament, LULC, rainfall,
    temperature, etc. are controlling keys to groundwater potential in a region (Pourtaghi
    and Pourghasemi, 2014; Preeja et al., 2021; Pandey et al., 2013; Sharma and Biswas,
    2013; Asgher et al., 2022; Chatterjee and Dutta, 2022; Ifediegwu, 2022). Moreover,
    determining the potential groundwater location using the test drilling method
    is reliable, but the process is very expensive and time-consuming (Biswas et al.,
    2013). Remote Sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques are very powerful
    and proved cost-effective for understanding groundwater resources (Jha et al.,
    2007; Rao et al., 2022a, Rao et al., 2022b; Moharir et al., 2023). Additionally,
    the time series rainfall data aids in understanding the interrelation with groundwater
    fluctuations (Todd and Mays, 2013). Geospatial techniques such as morphometry
    analysis (Biswas, et al., 2014; Sen Gupta et al., 2017; Rawat et al., 2017; Rawat
    et al., 2022), multi-criteria evaluation techniques such as FR technique (Singh
    et al., 2010; Das, 2019; Masoud et al., 2022), Multi influencing factor (Murmu
    et al., 2019; Sutradhar et al., 2022), Shannon entropy (Kordestani et al., 2019;
    Solaimani et al., 2019; Elvis et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Raj et al., 2022),
    Evidential belief function (Kordestani et al., 2019; Naghibi et al., 2019; Ghosh,
    2021), Artificial neural networks (Lee et al., 2012; Pradhan et al., 2021; Tamiru
    and Wagari, 2021), Fuzzy inference system (Milan et al., 2021), Bayesian models
    (KarimiKhosrowshahi et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2021; Karimi-Rizvandi et al., 2021),
    Random forest method (Naghibi et al., 2020; Sachdeva and Kumar, 2021; Masroor
    et al., 2021), Radial basis function (Panneerselvam et al., 2021), logistic regression
    techniques (Chen et al., 2018; Rizeei et al., 2019; Miraki et al., 2019), Dempster-Shafer
    model (Nithya and Jeeva, 2018; Obeidavi et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021; Pandey
    et al., 2022), weights of evidence model (Al-Abadi, 2015; Chen et al., 2018),
    decision tree models (Duan et al., 2016; Naghibi et al., 2019; Nguyen et al.,
    2020) and, bivariate and multivariate statistical methods have been applied for
    such study. The interpretation of potential groundwater by multi-criteria analysis
    (MCDA/MCDM), i.e., an AHP technique, has been also widely used by numerous researchers
    (Jaiswal et al., 2003; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Jha et al., 2010; Kaliraj et al.,
    2014a, Kaliraj et al., 2014b; Machiwal et al., 2011; Jothibasu and Anbazhagan,
    2016; Magesh et al., 2012; Dwivedi et al., 2016; Naghibi et al., 2015; Shanmukha
    Srinivas et al., 2022; Raj et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2022a, Rao et al., 2022b;
    Moharir et al., 2023). It is an excellent tool for groundwater management since
    it adds outline deliberations, availability, and reliability to the analysis (Machiwal
    et al., 2015). The combined use of GIS and AHP modifies and unifies geospatial
    maps and normalized weight to acquire data, which can be utilized in decision-making
    (Malczewski, 2006; Sahoo et al., 2017; Patra et al., 2018). Previous researchers
    quoted that the weights were assigned to the designated thematic layers and their
    features/attributes based on the study area (Machiwal et al., 2015; Patra et al.,
    2018). Moreover, the literature recommends that the AHP technique offers highly
    precise results compared to other modeling techniques (Barua et al., 2021; Pande
    et al., 2021; Senapati and Das, 2021, 2022). Moreover, a comprehensive understanding
    of aquifer dynamics and characteristics, employing hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical
    analyses, is essential for accurately assessing and quantifying groundwater resources
    (Shahid et al., 2000; Moharir et al., 2023). Hence, a systematic and integrated
    appraisal is critical for a sustainable groundwater aquifer system (Sanjrani et
    al., 2017; Arshad et al., 2020; Moharir et al., 2023). According to the World
    Health Organization (WHO), contaminated drinking water accounts for 80% of human
    illnesses, killing over 3.4 million people globally (Chaudhary and Satheeshkumar,
    2018). Hence, it is critical to identify groundwater quality in conjunction with
    its potential zones. Therefore, water quality mapping is vital for effectively
    managing and mitigating groundwater issues that help save lives and improve sustainable
    socio-economic growth (Harinarayana et al., 2000; Akbar et al., 2011). Different
    physicochemical properties of groundwater are used to determine its quality (Arumugam
    and Elangovan, 2009; Rana et al., 2021). These physicochemical characteristics
    of groundwater are controlled by aquifer properties and geological structures
    such as lineaments, fractures, and faults (Bera, 2010, Bera et al., 2021; Nayak
    et al., 2020). Moreover, both natural and anthropogenic sources are responsible
    for the degradation of groundwater quality. Anthropogenic impacts such as unsuitable
    management of agricultural and domestic waste raise the organic-inorganic contaminants
    in groundwater (Rao et al., 2021). The physicochemical parameters in groundwater
    above a threshold level cause many health issues in living beings. For example,
    fluoride is essential for drinking water as they are necessary for bones and teeth
    (Mohapatra, 2009; Samal et al., 2020). However, a higher fluoride concentration
    above 1.5 mg/L (WHO, 2017) harms health and causes a mottling of teeth (fluorosis)
    and ortho-related diseases. Similarly, high arsenic concentration causes a decrease
    in bone mineral density (Chakraborti et al., 1995). Similarly, high NO3− in water
    samples causes gastrointestinal problems, goiter, methemoglobinemia in infants,
    mental stress, etc. (Majumdar and Gupta, 2000). Excess Na+ causes nervous imbalance,
    heart diseases, and kidney disorders, whereas excessive Mg2+ causes stone problems
    in the alimentary canal and kidney (Marangella et al., 1996). Hence, regularly
    monitoring groundwater quality is crucial. Moreover, multivariate statistical
    analysis of hydrogeochemical data is highly quantitative and effective tools that
    help in the interpretation of analytical results, source distribution, and geochemical
    evolution of groundwater in aquifers (Jandu et al., 2021; Malik et al., 2021;
    Malik and Kavita, 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2023a, Kumar et al.,
    2023b). Hard rock aquifers (HRA) outcrop large areas within tectonically stable
    regions such as cratons, constituting over 20% of the Earth''s surface. However,
    the sustainable discharge in these areas is notably low (Lachassagne et al., 2021).
    Large parts of Africa, South America, Asia, and Australia depend on such groundwater
    resources (Lachassagne et al., 2021). HRA has been overexploited in India, particularly
    during the \"Green Revolution,\" leading to groundwater degradation in these regions
    (Lachassagne et al., 2021). The study area is in the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex,
    in the East Indian Shield. This complex geological terrain is facing groundwater
    shortage and quality issues due to climatological conditions (extreme heat during
    summer) and the overexploitation. Previously many researchers mapped the groundwater
    resources utilizing RS and GIS in analogous geological terrain worldwide, i.e.,
    fractured hard rock aquifer in the igneous and metamorphic terrain, e.g., in the
    central highlands of Eritrea (Solomon and Quiel, 2006); North-central Nigeria
    (Ishola et al., 2023); southwestern part of Nigeria (Fashae et al., 2014); West
    Africa (Oussou et al., 2022); Gedaref State located in eastern Sudan (Elubid et
    al., 2019); west of Salamanca in Spain (Francés et al., 2014). Moreover, in the
    study area, Kundu and Nag (2018) reported that groundwater is contaminating and
    posing several health risks. However, a comprehensive and integrated study utilizing
    remote sensing and GIS, hydrogeochemical fingerprinting, and statistical modeling
    to evaluate groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) and understand the hydrogeochemical
    behavior was not conducted in the study region, and this research uniquely integrates
    the groundwater potential and quality to fill the research gap. This scientific
    study will undoubtedly bring new research guidelines for future workers. The main
    objectives of the study are: (i) to delineate the groundwater potential zones
    (GWPZ) using Remote Sensing, GIS, and AHP methods; (ii) evaluating the degree
    and spatial variations of groundwater quality using the Water Quality Index (WQI),
    facies evaluation, multivariate statistical analysis, and saturation indices;
    (iii) Integrating the GWPZ and WQI for a comprehensive and insightful result;
    and (iv) to study the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes. The
    methodology employed in this study will help demarcate the potential groundwater
    zones to battle scarcity and monitor and mitigate quality issues in the analogous
    geological terrains in Africa, India, North and South America, Australia, and
    Europe. This, in turn, also enhances the agricultural revenue and overcomes the
    socio-economic difficulties of the rural regions. 2. Background 2.1. Study area,
    location, and climate The study area is situated in the western part of West Bengal,
    situated at the intersection of Singhbhum rocks and the Chhotanagpur Granite Gneissic
    Complex and bounded between 85°49ʹ25\" E to 86°54ʹ37\" E and 22°42ʹ35\" N to 23°42ʹ00\"
    N (Fig. 1). The rocks are mostly metamorphosed, which belongs to the Proterozoic
    age (Gupta and Basu, 2000). The study area experiences an uneven distribution
    of average annual rainfall, ranging from 1100 to 1500 mm (Banik et al., 2002).
    It exhibits a semi-arid climate characterized by cooler winters and hotter summers.
    Summer temperatures can soar to around 45 °C, while winter temperatures can drop
    to a minimum of 8 °C (Kundu and Nag, 2018). The region experiences the driest
    weather in West Bengal due to its low relative humidity. Download : Download high-res

    The study area encompasses a diverse group of rocks, ages ranging from Archean
    to recent (Pyne, 1992; Bhattacharya, 1989). It comprises granite gneiss/biotite
    granite gneiss, meta-basic, meta-sediments, pegmatites calc granulite, and quartz
    veins (Mazumdar et al., 1988), metasedimentary and meta basics of Singhbhum Group,
    Dalma group of Basic Volcanic rocks, intrusive granites i.e., Kuilapal/Manbhum
    Granites, Gondwana Group of sedimentaries with coal seams, and quaternary sediments.
    The Singhbhum Group and the Gneissic Complex boundary has prominent mineralization
    of copper, lead, apatite-magnetite, etc., and is marked by the WNW–ESE trending
    shear zone, known as the south Purulia shear zone (Sarkar et al., 1992; Gupta
    and Basu, 2000). Another shear zone has been traced further to the north, associated
    with barites, apatite–magnetite, and REE mineralization (Baidya, 1992). Broadly,
    the study area mainly comprises granite-gneissic rock type. 2.3. Geomorphology
    and soil types The study area is characterized by elevated topography, uneven
    terrain in the eastern and southern parts, and sloping towards the ESE part. The
    study area contains various soil types: coarse, gritty soil with rock fragments,
    lateritic soil, sandy, and gravel-loamy soil and are slightly acidic (pH: 5.1
    to 6.7). The geomorphological features and soil types are critical factors in
    delineating the potential zones (Saunders, 2001; Balamurugan et al., 2008). 2.4.
    Hydrogeology The groundwater reserve in the study area is mainly in secondary
    porosity. Additionally, structural discontinuities (joints, fractures) and topography
    control the groundwater movement, and rainwater is the primary source of groundwater
    recharge in the study area (Acharya et al., 2014). Moreover, topography is also
    responsible for 50% of the surface runoff and affects the recharge potential of
    the region. Damodar, Kangsabati, Kumari, Silabati (silai), Dwarakeswar, and Subarnarekha
    are the main rivers. The divergence and convergence of groundwater flow lines
    show the movement of water from groundwater mounds to lows (Fig. 4d) and exhibit
    topography control on groundwater movement. The groundwater distribution in the
    study area is predominantly associated with specific geological formations, e.g.,
    weathered mantle (up to 25m thickness), sparolitic zone (10–30 mbgl), fractured
    hard rock aquifers (50–110 mbgl), and narrow zones of unconsolidated sediments
    near river valleys (5–13 mbgl) (Central Ground Water Board, 2004; Central Ground
    Water Board, 2006a,b; Gupta and Patel, 2021). The yield prospect of hard rock
    aquifers is quite low (5 m3/h) (Central Ground Water Board, 2022). 3. Materials
    and methods 3.1. Thematic layers The geospatial studies use toposheets, satellite
    imagery, soil maps (NATMO), and lithological maps (GSI). The Sentinel-2 satellite
    imagery dated 13-04-2019 was used in the present work. The band characteristics
    of the Sentinel-2 dataset are given in Table S1. The data resources utilized to
    prepare different thematic layers are mentioned in Table 1. The ERDAS Imagine
    software is used to prepare Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map, and ArcGIS (version
    10.3) is utilized for image processing and making rest of the thematic maps. Initially,
    all toposheets used in this study were geo-registered using ERDAS Imagine based
    on ground control points. In the present study, the satellite data has shown outstanding
    positional matching compared with the regional toposheet; hence, re-georeferencing
    of the acquired data was not implemented. Following Magesh et al. (2012), the
    Weightage Overlay Analysis (WOA) technique was applied to integrate eight thematic
    maps derived from remote sensing. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is employed
    to select weights for each parameter based on their position, following Shaban
    et al. (2006). All thematic maps were overlaid to identify the GWPZ in the study
    area. The different intra-weightage and weightage assigned to various thematic
    layers to quantify the groundwater potential are specified in Table 2. Moreover,
    the study utilizes the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation technique,
    known for its numerous automation capabilities and efficient programming algorithm,
    ensuring rapid and precise computations (Lu and Wong, 2008). IDW swiftly ascertains
    cell values automated in a linear-weighted set of amalgamations of sample locations
    depending on the degree of cell similarity (Choi and Chong, 2022). Thematic maps
    have been given weightage using AHP and WOA techniques to perceive groundwater
    potential zones affected by various environmental influences. Table 1. Data resources

    (AHP) method AHP is a decision-making technique proposed by Saaty (1990) that
    reflects the multiple parameters and calculates their comparative standing in
    defining groundwater zones. It is a subclass of the MCDA method that comprises
    analyzing and deciding on multiple objectives (Murmu et al., 2019). AHP''s advantages
    include its hierarchical formulation, accuracy, and efficiency, making it a reasonable
    and less computational time technique (Pande et al., 2021). According to Saaty
    (1980), the AHP approach is subjective, with subunit selection and weighting based
    on assessments of various characteristics obtained via the appropriate decision-making
    process. It is an appropriate criterion based on preferred factors that control
    the weight in the AHP technique (DavoudiMoghaddam et al., 2020; Haghizadeh et
    al., 2017; Mukherjee and Singh, 2020; Panahi et al., 2020). The method can manage
    many datasets for the chosen criteria weights, making this superior among similar
    GIS techniques (Chen et al., 2018; Jha et al., 2010). It is one of the most significant
    techniques for appropriately assigning the weight of each thematic map with an
    accuracy of more than 95% (Andualem and Demeke, 2019; Ahmad et al., 2020; Aykut,
    2021; Melese and Belay, 2021; Rajesh et al., 2021). Finally, all thematic maps
    suitable for GWPZ were interpreted and classified based on the weight and rank
    factors evaluated in the analysis. The final GWPZ map was prepared using the formula
    (Biswas et al., 2012, 2013; Paul et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021): (1) Where
    G = geomorphology, L = lithology, LL = landuse/landcover, Sl = slope, S = soil,
    D = drainage density, L = lineament density, and R=Rainfall data. Here, ‘w’ is
    the weight of the theme, and ‘r’ is the rank of a feature in each theme. The quantile
    classification method reclassified the result into very good, good, moderate,
    low, and very low. The Logical sequence of the methods followed is shown in Fig.

    Fig. 2. Logical sequence of the methodology. 3.2. Hydrogeochemical characterization
    and facies evaluation A hydrogeochemical study was carried out from 60 groundwater
    samples collected from the tube wells and dug wells (Pre-monsoon 2019) by the
    Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). The water level ranges from 0.8 to 9.8 m below
    ground level (mbgl). The sampling aquifer is semi-confined in nature (fractured
    hard rock aquifers ∼ 95%) except phreatic those near the rivers (Gupta and Patel,
    2021). The collected water samples were later analyzed for water quality parameters
    (pH, TDS, EC) and ionic concentrations (mg/L) of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−,
    NO3−, F−, CO32− and HCO3− as well as for heavy metal (Fe). The Equipment was calibrated
    following laboratory standards, and the analytical data errors for cation and
    anion are calculated within ±5%. Further, spatial visualization maps were plotted
    to depict the variation of measured water quality parameters and ionic concentrations
    in the study area. Moreover, the dynamics of ion exchange, as well as dependency
    and association between variables, is comprehended utilizing ionic ratios (Giménez-Forcada,
    E., 2019). The Piper (Piper, 1944) plot is evaluated to study the hydrochemical
    facies, and the factor controlling the groundwater chemistry is interpreted with
    the Gibbs plot (Gibbs, 1970). The suitability of groundwater for potability was
    evaluated following threshold values defined by BIS (BIS, 2012) and WHO (WHO,
    2017). 3.2.1. Multivariate statistical analysis Multivariate statistical analysis
    such as Pearson correlation matrix (Pearson, 1896), R-mode factor analysis using
    principal component analysis (PCA), K-means, and agglomerative hierarchical cluster
    analysis (AHC) is carried out to uncover the relation between observations (water
    samples) and variables (Physico-chemical parameters). PCA reduces the dataset''s
    complexity, reveals underlying information, and identifies the key components
    that govern groundwater''s hydrogeochemical characteristics (Tran et al., 2020).
    In addition, PCA, in conjunction with K-means, is an effective method for data
    visualization (Napoleon and Pavalakodi, 2011). AHC is widely used for hierarchical
    cluster analysis (HCA) for grouping data with similar hydrogeochemical properties
    (Kumar et al., 2023a, Kumar et al., 2023b). 3.2.2. Water quality index (WQI) Water
    quality index (WQI) has been studied based on WHO (2017) standards. It is calculated
    using the weighted arithmetic method following Horton (1965); Brown et al., (1972),
    utilizing the equation: (2) Where n = number of parameters, Wi = unit weight of
    ith parameter, and Qi = quality rating of the ith parameter. The Unit weight is
    calculated using the equation: (3) where K = proportional constant, Sn = standard
    permissible value of the ith parameter stated by WHO (2017). K is considered ‘1’
    and has been calculated using the equation: (4) Qi is calculated using the equation:
    (5) where Vo = observed value at sampling site of the ith parameter, and Vi =
    ideal value of the ith parameter in pure water. Except for pH and dissolved oxygen,
    ideal values of all the parameters are considered zero for drinking water (Tripathy
    and Sahu, 2005). The pH standard value is 7.0 for uncontaminated water and 8.5
    for polluted water. 3.2.3. Mineral saturation index The saturation index (SI)
    is calculated using PHREEQC following Parkhurst and Appelo (1999) to evaluate
    groundwater''s geochemical evolution and potential to dissolve or precipitate
    the minerals. It is expressed as: (6) Where, IAP is the mineral ion reaction''s
    ionic activity product, and K is the thermodynamic equilibrium. The SI < 0, SI
    = 0, and SI > 0 signifies groundwater subsaturation, equilibrium, and supersaturation
    to specific minerals. The range of saturation may be considered 0 ± 0.5 due to
    various natural stimuli (Tran et al., 2020). 3.2.4. Computation of chloro-alkaline
    index To comprehend the positive and negative ion exchange reaction between groundwater
    and aquifer material, the Chloro-Alkaline Index (CAI) is computed following equations
    (7), (8) (Schoeller, 1977): (7) (8) 3.2.5. Irrigation water quality The use of
    contaminated groundwater for Irrigation purposes causes reduced soil infiltration
    capability/permeability, alters nutrient cycling, and ultimately adversely affects
    crop production (Kumar et al., 2023a, Kumar et al., 2023b). Hence in the study
    area, the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes is evaluated using
    the United States Salinity Laboratory (Wilcox, 1955) and Wilcox plot (Richards,
    1954). Additionally, Na% (Wilcox, 1955) and Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) (Richards,
    1954), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Kelly''s ratio (Kelley, 1963), Magnesium
    hazard (MH) (Szabolcs and Darab, 1964), and Total hardness (U.S. EPA, 1986) is
    calculated using equations (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) respectively. (9)
    (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) All the ionic concentration is taken in meq/L. Kelly''s
    ratio >1 signifies the unsuitability of groundwater for irrigation because excess
    Na+ leads to a reduction in soil fertility. The upsurge in Na+ can be taken as
    a salinity hazard called the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Magnesium ratio (MH)
    is an increase of magnesium in the soil (Szabolcs and Darab, 1964), and Residual
    sodium carbonate (RSC) > 1.25 in groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation purposes.
    As RSC increases, the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions precipitate, increase the Na+ percentage
    in soil and water, and increase the potential for sodium hazard (Seeyan et al.,
    2022). 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Delineation of ground water potential zones
    In the present work, different thematic layers were used (n = 8), e.g., drainage
    and lineament density, slope, soil, LULC, geomorphology, rainfall, and lithology,
    are considered for the delineation of GWPZ (Mukherjee and Singh, 2020; Doke et
    al., 2021; Mandal et al., 2021; Melese and Belay, 2021; Anteneh et al., 2022).
    These maps are applied to identify the groundwater potential zones following the
    AHP method. The final GWPZ map was established using weighted overlay analysis.
    The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to validate
    the model, considering the area under the curve (AUC) using groundwater level
    and discharge data. The description of each thematic map and the final GWPZ mapping
    and its validation are given below. 4.1.1. Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) The
    LULC patterns greatly influence water infiltration and surface flow rates because
    flora and forest cover slow water flow, control soil moisture, and surface runoff
    has more time to percolate or seep into the aquifers (Arulbalaji et al., 2019a,
    Arulbalaji et al., 2019b). In contrast, settlements/built-up, hard rock cover,
    and concrete roads prevent water from infiltrating and increase runoff. Croplands
    and water bodies are always excellent regions for recharging (Kumar, 2018). LULC
    directly influences groundwater recharge, hence an important factor for delineating
    GWPZ. In the present study, supervised classification using the maximum likelihood
    technique is used to generate the LULC map (Jensen, 1996), and this method is
    known to be very accurate for such operations (Sisodia et al., 2014). This study
    classified the LULC map into 8 categories, e.g., water bodies, bare ground, built
    area, crops, flooded vegetation, grass, shrubs, and trees. Several surface-water
    bodies include rivers, streams, small perennial ponds, and seasonal water sources.
    The LULC map shows that vegetation dominates the hilly areas (Fig. 3a and b).

    Geomorphology The geomorphology of any area is crucial for replenishing the subsurface
    aquifers with surface water (Balamurugan et al., 2008; Kumar and Krishna, 2018;Doke
    et al., 2021; Anteneh et al., 2022). Geomorphology shows numerous landforms and
    topographic features that occur in an area (Arulbalaji et al., 2019a, Arulbalaji
    et al., 2019b). It is crucial to understand groundwater resources as geomorphology
    controls the distribution and movement of surface water. As a result, it is often
    utilized as an essential component for determining groundwater potential (Arulbalaji
    et al., 2019a, Arulbalaji et al., 2019b; Achu et al., 2020; Doke et al., 2021).
    The geomorphological map is produced following the Geological Survey of India
    (GSI, 2019). Most of the area shows a pediment pediplain complex, as shown in
    Fig. 3b. 4.1.3. Lithology Lithology critically influences groundwater distribution
    in a region (Yeh et al., 2016; Ifediegwu, 2022). Massive hard rocks act as aquifuge
    (Todd and Mays, 2011) and become aquifers as a result of secondary porosity formation
    caused by weathering and tectonic processes (Subba Rao, 1992, 2003). Groundwater
    flow and storage depends on the degree of weathering and the amount of fractured
    rock, which controls water penetration rate (Ahmad et al., 2020; Aykut, 2021;
    Khan et al., 2022). Hence, the larger the secondary porosity density, the better
    groundwater infiltration. The geological fingerprints of diverse lithologies may
    be understood by evaluating the various spectral signatures of the rocks, such
    as their tones, textures, and reflectivity (Jensen, 1996; Lillesand and Kiefer,
    2000). In the study area, major lithology types are shown in Fig. 3c. 4.1.4. Soil
    The soil plays a significant role in the infiltration of groundwater into the
    aquifer system (Melese and Belay, 2021; Mandal et al., 2021; Ifediegwu, 2022),
    which is a function of the grain size of the soil (Ndhlovu and Woyessa, 2021;
    Pandey et al., 2021). Diverse soil properties such as porosity, texture, and coefficient
    of permeability (Eid et al., 2006; Elbeih, 2007) define the infiltration potential
    and recharge (Saunders, 2001). Multispectral satellite imagery and existing soil
    maps were used to classify texture-based soil (Ahmed and Iqbal, 2014; NATMO, 2021).
    In the study area, gravelly loamy texture was the most dominant, followed by fine
    loamy and coarse loamy (Fig. 3d). 4.1.5. Digital elevation map The digital elevation
    model (DEM) is the most discrete form of digital landscape representation (Saraf
    and Choudhury, 1998). DEM describes gridded elevation data that show the difference
    in elevation across space. In the present study, DEM is generated from ASTER-DEM
    satellite data. The elevation model shows a positive gradient towards the E–W
    direction (Fig. 3e). 4.1.6. Slope The slope is a significant factor in controlling
    groundwater infiltration (Ahmad et al., 2020; Rajesh et al., 2021; Khan et al.,
    2022) that helps in comprehending the groundwater potential zone. The steep gradient
    causes higher runoff, and lower groundwater infiltration, resulting in low groundwater
    occurrence and vice versa (Moharir et al., 2023; Singh and Katpatal, 2018; Naghibi
    et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2022; Ifediegwu, 2022). The slope map was prepared
    in a GIS environment using ASTER-DEM satellite data. The slope map (in degrees)
    of the study area is shown in Fig. 3f. 4.1.7. Drainage and drainage density Surface
    flow depends on the soil permenability; hence, the drainage density is critical
    for subsurface aquifer replenishment (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed, 2016). Various
    structural landscapes, for example, crevices, lineaments, and faults, primarily
    regulate drainage patterns and density (Balamurugan et al., 2016; Aju et al.,
    2021; Allafta et al., 2021). In the study area, most rivers and streams are not
    perennial. The most prominent riverbed lithology is gravel and sand. Flow accumulation
    was computed using toposheet and Sentinel-2 data and processed in the Arc GIS
    environment. Fig. 4a shows an overlay of drainage channels and density in the
    study area. It can be seen that the drainage density is higher in the central
    and southern parts of the study area. 4.1.8. Lineament and lineament density Lineaments,
    formed by crustal movements, are significant for understanding the GWPZ of any
    area as it act as channels for water movement within the aquifers by providing
    secondary porosity (Preeja et al., 2011; Bera et al., 2020; Verma and Patel, 2021).
    Satellite imagery can be used to identify the linear features such as faults,
    joints, and fractures (Agarwal and Garg, 2015). In the present study, lineament
    density was calculated utilizing Sentinel-2 data by applying the line density
    tool in the ArcGIS environment. High lineament density is found in the northeastern
    and northwestern parts of the studied region (Fig. 4b). Lineament densities are
    also reasonably high in the southern part of the study area. Moreover, lineament
    intersection density is low in the middle part of the study area (0–4.6). Very
    high lineaments density regions are exciting places for developing good groundwater
    potential zones. 4.1.9. Rainfall Rainfall is vital to groundwater recharge (Viswanathan,
    1984; Butterworth et al., 1999; Hughes et al., 2021; Allafta et al., 2021; Aykut,
    2021; Ifediegwu, 2022). For example, Dry weather causes a lack of humidity in
    the atmosphere, exacerbated by minimal rainfall, resulting in increased evaporation
    and less recharge (Todd and Mays, 2011). So, if the climate is arid, the groundwater
    recharge will be low (Rao et al., 2022a). However, a wet climate ensures lower
    evaporation initiation and groundwater levels may increase as more significant
    rainfall is recharged, resulting in better groundwater potential (Hagos and Andualem,
    2021; Ndhlovu and Woyessa, 2021; Khan et al., 2022). Thus, rainfall is a major
    recharge source of groundwater, which plays a significant role in infiltration
    and groundwater recharge through the soil layers and weathered and/or fractured
    zones (Kolli et al., 2020). In this study, average annual precipitation data from
    2001 to 2021 (IMD) were collected. Fig. 4c shows the spatial distribution of precipitation
    in the study area. The map shows minimum rainfall in the western region and higher
    rainfall in the eastern part. 4.1.10. Groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) mapping
    The groundwater potential zone mapping is vital for emerging approaches for recharging.
    GWPZ mapping is extremely valuable for preparing emerging watersheds and deciphering
    the recharge sites. Researchers employed remote sensing and AHP techniques to
    prepare different thematic maps and found them critical in identifying potential
    groundwater zones (Rao et al., 2022a, Rao et al., 2022b; Moharir et al., 2023).
    The study involved delineating extraction classes of layers using digital and
    visual explanation techniques. These prepared thematic layers were ranked by the
    hierarchical analytical process. Each thematic layer was ranked and weighted following
    Moharir et al. (2023), the importance of layers, and references from various literature
    and government reports for a more accurate outcome (Table 2). Further, the final
    GWPZ map was prepared following Biswas et al. (2012, 2013), and Paul et al. (2020).
    The GWPZ map reveals five main groundwater potential zones in the study area.
    Out of a total of 6592 km2, approximately 39 km2 of this area shows a very good
    potential zone, 945 km2 area fits into the good potential zone, followed by 3426
    km2 area to the moderate potential zone, and approximately 2125 km2 and 57 km2
    show low, and very low zone (Table 3 and Fig. 5). The very good GWPZ (Fig. 5)
    coincides with the sedimentary formations in the NE part of the study area (Fig.
    3c). Table 3. Status of groundwater potential in Purulia district. Groundwater

    4.1.11. GWPZ validation using the ROC model The Receiver Operating Characteristic
    (ROC) curve is a valuable tool for assessing the precision of a predictive model,
    such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) results for GWPZ mapping. Based on
    the GWPZ map, we classified the study area into different GWPZs using a quantile
    classification method (Moharir et al., 2023). To see the aptness of the potential
    groundwater zones from the above interpretation, the ROC curve and sub-curve area
    (AUC) were calculated from the groundwater potential and runoff data (Naghibi
    et al., 2016). The GWPZ map (Fig. 5) further correlated with the water table and
    groundwater discharge data (Fig. 4d and e). Fig. 4f displays the ROC diagram;
    the AUC is 91.4%, indicating the model''s accuracy. 4.2. Hydrogeochemical characterization
    The water quality parameters such as pH, EC, and TDS are evaluated. The groundwater
    samples show a pH of 7.54–8.36 (mean = 7.96), suggesting samples are alkaline.
    However, based on the pH of the groundwater, it is under permissible limits for
    consumption following WHO (2017) and BIS (2012). Electrical conductance (EC) in
    samples ranges from 153 to 2548 μS/cm (mean = 933.7 μS/cm). The groundwater samples
    show a total dissolved solid (TDS) from 92 to 1416 mg/L (mean = 522.47 mg/L).
    Based on the TDS values of water samples, about 90% are freshwater/non-saline
    type, and 10% belong to slightly saline water type (Table 7). The spatial distribution
    maps of EC and pH (Fig. 7a b) depict the regions showing higher values. Table

    depict major ionic concentrations in groundwater utilizing Box and Whisker Plot
    and Schoeller Plot, respectively. The trend of cationic and anionic concentration
    in the study area is Mg2+> Na+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3− > Cl− > NO3− > SO42− > F−
    respectively (Fig. 6a). The Summary of the hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater
    samples is given in Table 4. Two major cationic constituents, i.e., Na+ concentration,
    range from 8 to 193 mg/L (mean = 67.38 mg/L), while that of Mg2+ varies from 5
    to 203 mg/L (mean = 63.58 mg/L). In contrast, the concentration of Ca2+ varies
    from 8 to 70 mg/L (mean = 20.7 mg/L), though the K+ concentration ranges from
    1 to 65 mg/L (mean = 9.3 mg/L). In anionic concentration, the Cl− in groundwater
    fluctuates from 11 to 557 mg/L (mean = 153 mg/L). The higher concentration of
    Cl− in the study area may be due to non-atmospheric and non-lithogenic sources
    (Jalali, 2007; Singh et al., 2011), i.e., domestic release, agricultural, anthropogenic,
    and animal waste. In the studied region, HCO3− ion ranges from 67 to 573 mg/L
    (mean = 195 mg/L). In the study area, the formation of HCO3− from silicate weathering
    takes place due to the interaction of CO2 from the atmosphere with aluminosilicate
    rocks, making elevated CO2 pressure in the soil, which dissolves with water in
    the soil media that percolates in the aquifers. The higher concentration of HCO3−
    than other anions in groundwater shows the weathering of primary silicate rocks
    in the region (Rose, 2002). The NO3− varies from 1 to 249 mg/L (mean = 41.22 mg/L)
    in groundwater, which may be from anthropogenic actions and excessive usage of
    fertilizers (Kumar et al., 2022, 2023). NO3− sources may also be from animal wastes
    and return flow from irrigation (Raju et al., 2010). It may also be due to atmospheric
    precipitation, nitrification of NH4+ of agricultural fertilizer, and biological
    fixation of nitrogen (Appelo and Postma, 1999). The SO42− concentration ranges
    from 2 to 205 mg/L (mean = 41.32 mg/L), indicating that fewer locations have higher
    concentrations indicating agriculture and anthropogenic causes (Berner and Berner,
    1987). Moreover, fluoride concentration fluctuates from 0.06 to 1.17 mg/L (mean
    = 0.48 mg/L). The higher fluoride concentration is primarily due to a geogenic
    source, which exceeds the acceptable limit defined by WHO (2017) (Table 4). Fluoride
    concentration increases due to the alkaline nature of groundwater (Adimalla et
    al., 2019), and this condition helps release fluoride from F-bearing minerals
    (Raju et al., 2010; Ghosh and Bera, 2023). In the northeastern part of the study
    area, the presence of shale and coal seam results in the contamination of groundwater
    due to mining activities. The ions in some of the samples were found beyond their
    acceptable and desirable limits (Table 4). The ionic concentrations above a desired
    limit cause the water to be contaminated, and, hence, unfit for consumption and
    irrigation. Spatial distribution maps of major cationic and anion concentrations
    (K+, Mg2+, Na+, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3−, Cl−, and F−) are plotted to visualize the
    trend in the studied region (Fig. 7c–f, and Fig. 8a–e). It shows that similar
    regions in the study area show higher values of anionic and cationic concentrations
    and cause higher EC in the same regions (Fig. 7a). Download : Download high-res

    from 0.01 to 0.51 mg/L, indicating some of the groundwater samples are above the
    acceptable limit defined by WHO (2017). That may be due to the dissolution of
    the ferrous constituent of the borehole. 4.2.1. Hydrogeochemical facies evaluation
    The hydrochemical facies are illustrated by the Piper plot (Piper, 1944) (Fig.
    9). The diagrams suggest that water types in the study area include Mixed Ca–Na–HCO3,
    Mixed Ca–Mg–Cl, Ca–HCO3, and Na–Cl (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image

    facies. Alkaline earth (Ca2+ + Mg2+) exceeds alkali (Na+ + K+) in most groundwater
    samples, as Ca2+ and Mg2+ together account for 52% of the total cations compared
    to Na+ and K+, which constitute 48% of the total cation. The Mg2+ value exceeds
    the Ca2+ concentration, implying that the ionic input comes after the weathering
    of ferromagnetic minerals associated with basic and mafic rocks. Gibbs plots (Gibbs,
    1970) depict the rock weathering dominance on hydrochemistry (Fig. 10), i.e.,
    the interaction of groundwater with in-situ rock minerals, e.g., dissolution of
    sulfide, carbonate, and silicate, is responsible for the ionic concentration.
    However, the trend towards the evaporation series of the water samples in the
    Gibbs plot also infers that some of the samples are also influenced by evaporite
    dominance (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (511KB) Download : Download

    The major cationic and anionic concentration is plotted to comprehend the hydrochemical
    evolution process, i.e., the process of water-rock interaction and factors controlling
    groundwater chemistry (Fig. 11). The samples falling near the 1:1 line in (Ca2+
    + Mg2+) vs (HCO3− + SO42−) plot (Fig. 11a) suggested that the dissolution of calcite,
    dolomite, and gypsum are critical for groundwater chemistry (Cerling et al., 1989;
    Fisher and Mulican, 1997). The samples falling between the 1:1 line and (HCO3−
    + SO42−) axis suggest a contribution of ions from many non-carbonate sources and
    is balanced by alkali metals (Na+ and K+). The comparative plots of (Na++K+) vs
    (Ca2++ Mg2+) show the ascendency of alkaline earth over alkali in the study area
    (Fig. 11d). Moreover, Na + vs. Ca2+, and HCO3−/Na + vs Ca2+/Na+ plots (Fig. 11b
    and c) suggest silicate weathering is a prominent formative mechanism controlling
    groundwater chemistry in the study area. The chloralkaline index (CAI) signifies
    an ionic exchange in a suitable environment between groundwater and aquifer material.
    Groundwater with low salt dissolved specifies a negative CAI value, while positive
    CAI signifies salt-enriched groundwater (Fig. 11e). The positive CAI (I and II)
    indicate the exchange of Na+ and K+ (groundwater) with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (soil and/or
    rock), and a negative value specifies the exchange of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (water) with
    Na+ and K+ (soil and/or rock) following the reaction: (15) Download : Download

    (Na+ + K+), and (d) CAI-I vs. CAI-II. The positive value is described by the base
    exchange reaction (Schoeller, 1967, 1977). In the base exchange process, if HCO3−
    < (Ca2+ and Mg2+), then the Na+ ion is replaced for alkaline earth and resulting
    in formation of hard water, and for soften water if HCO3− > (Ca2+ and Mg2+) then
    alkaline earth was replaced for Na+. Fig. 11e depicts that reverse ion exchange
    is chief controlling factor in the study area. 4.2.2. Multivariate statistical
    analysis Pearson correlation matrix (Fig. 12) shows that there is a moderate to
    significant positive correlation (r > 0.8: significant, and r ≥ 0.5 to ≤ 0.8:
    moderate) between EC, and TDS with Mg2+, Na+, Cl−, NO3−, and SO4−. This indicates
    that these ions are major contributors and controlling variables of the groundwater
    chemistry in the study area. There is also moderate to significant positive correlation
    between Mg2+ and Cl− (r = 0.90), pH and HCO3− (r = 0.58), Na+ and Mg2+ (r = 0.64),
    Na+ and Cl− (r = 0.70), Na+ and NO3− (r = 0.62), Na+ and SO42− (r = 0.58) (Fig.

    on the Kaiser criterion and Varimax rotation with the Kaiser normalization technique.
    In this study, the KMO measure of sample adequacy is 0.562, and Bartlett''s sphericity
    test is 0.0001 (<0.05), suggesting that PCA can be used effectively for data analysis
    (Kaiser, 1974). The results of the factor analysis and its attributes are given
    in Table 5. The three factors contribute 71.726 % of the total variance of all
    parameters evaluated in factor analysis. Factor 1 explains 46.474 % of the total
    variance (Fig. 13 a, b; and Table 5) and is mainly attributed to higher loading
    of TDS, Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, NO3− and SO42− (Fig. 13c). These are the major contributors
    of groundwater chemistry in the study area. NO3− and SO42− are attributed to anthropogenic
    activities such as using inorganic fertilizers (Kumar et al., 2023a, Kumar et
    al., 2023b). Ion exchange reactions also play a significant role in enriching
    these ions in the groundwater. Factor 2 attributes 13.829 % of the total variance
    (Table 5) and mainly comprises K+, HCO3−, and Ca2+ ions (Fig. 13c). HCO3− enrichment
    may be due to the recharge (Sunkari et al., 2021). Moreover, factor 3 attributes
    11.423 % of the total variance (Table 5) and mainly comprises F− ion (Fig. 13c).

    K-means (Fig. 13d), groups the groundwater samples, evaluates the groundwater
    quality based on the intrinsic similarity in the datasets, and forms 3 hydrochemical
    classes/clusters (Marín Celestino et al., 2018). Further, a Polar heatmap with
    a dendrogram of AHC of water samples is plotted (Fig. 14), and hierarchical clustering
    is done in both row and column of the data matrix. The polar heatmap depicts the
    variation of physico-chemical parameters in the water samples. The row and column
    dendrogram show the clustering of water samples and physico-chemical parameters,
    respectively. The column dendrogram results are similar to the factor analysis
    results. Row dendrogram groups the groundwater samples into 3 clusters based on
    similar physico-chemical properties. C1 cluster (n = 8) has a higher value of
    all physico-chemical properties and is contaminated groundwater samples in the
    study area, followed by C2 (n = 16) and C3 cluster (n = 36). The overall ionic
    trend of C1 is Mg2+> Na+ > Ca2+ > K+, and Cl− > HCO3− > NO3− > SO42− > F−. While
    the ionic concentration in C2 is Mg2+ ≈ Na+ > Ca2+ > K+, and HCO3− > Cl− > SO42−
    > NO3− > F−. Moreover, concentration in C3 is in order Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K,
    and HCO3− > Cl− > SO42− > NO3− > F−. The results of Fig. 14 are similar to the
    K-means clustering (Fig. 13d) outcome, as discussed above. Download : Download

    semi-arid climatic conditions; hence, it is essential to comprehend the influence
    of evaporation in the groundwater system. Hence in the present study, saturation
    indices (SI) of calcite, dolomite, fluorite, and gypsum are computed following
    equation (6). The results show that most groundwater samples in the study area
    are undersaturated for gypsum while saturated for calcite and dolomite (Fig. 15).
    This further supports the occurrence of hard water in the present study area.
    Additionally, fluorite is saturated in most groundwater samples, which may cause
    serious health consequences. Download : Download high-res image (893KB) Download

    classes have been defined based on the water quality index (WQI) map (Table 6).
    It shows that 90% of groundwater samples in the study area are in the excellent
    category, while 1% and 4% are in the very poor and unsuitable categories, respectively.
    The spatial distribution map indicates the study area has safe water quality for
    drinking purposes based on WQI, except for some locations where WQI >75 (Fig.
    8f). These regions also show elevated hydrochemical parameter values in the study
    area (Fig. 8f). The spatial distribution map of GWPZ and WQI reveals that places
    with poor groundwater potential also have low/unsuitable water quality, which
    signifies that over-extraction of groundwater is also responsible for groundwater
    degradation. 4.2.5. Suitability for irrigation purposes In the present study,
    various classification schemes have been adopted to infer the suitability of groundwater
    irrigation purposes. Based on %Na (Wilcox, 1955), 13%, 59%, and 28% of groundwater
    samples are in excellent, good, and permissible categories (Table 7). Moreover,
    based on SAR (Richards, 1954), RSC (Richards, 1954), and TH (Sawyer and McCarty,
    1978), 100% of water samples are in the excellent category for irrigation purposes
    (Table 7). However, in the KR classification (Kelley, 1963), 98% of samples are
    suitable, and 2% are unsuitable. Based on the MH classification (Szabolcs and
    Darab, 1964), 6% are suitable, and 94% of samples are unsuitable. TDS shows that
    90% of samples are non-saline and suitable for irrigation. However, 10% of samples
    are slightly saline and unsuitable for irrigation. Wilcox and the USSL plot (Fig.
    16a and b) show that some groundwater samples are in doubtful to unsuitable category.

    values (Fig. 17). Download : Download high-res image (569KB) Download : Download

    an acute groundwater shortage, which triggers the groundwater quality deterioration.
    Hence, in the present study, an integrated method of remote sensing and GIS and
    field data is integrated to determine the groundwater potential zones and comprehend
    its geochemical behavior. Different thematic maps were integrated for groundwater
    potential zone (GWPZ) mapping, showing that >84% of the area comes under very
    low to moderate potential zones. Moreover, <15% of the area shows good potential
    zones and is cross-validated with AUC (=91.4 %). Analysis of hydrogeochemical
    data suggests that in the study area, the major water types are Mixed Ca–Na–HCO3,
    Mixed Ca–Mg–Cl, Ca–HCO3, and Na–Cl. The hydrogeochemical analysis also shows that
    silicate weathering and reverse ion reactions through rock-water interaction are
    controlling processes as the geogenic factors. K-means clustering and hierarchical
    cluster analysis (HCA) classify the water samples into three classes, where C1
    has a higher value of all physico-chemical properties and contains contaminated
    groundwater samples. The factor analysis suggests that Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, NO3−, and
    SO42− are major contributors to groundwater chemistry in the study area. Additionally,
    the groundwater is oversaturated with calcite, dolomite, and fluorite. It may
    be responsible for the hardness of groundwater. Further, WQI shows that 1% and
    4% of the samples are in very poor and unsuitable categories, respectively. The
    spatial distribution map of GWPZ and WQI shows that the regions with low groundwater
    potential are also low in water quality, suggesting that over-extraction of groundwater
    is also responsible for groundwater deterioration. Suitability for irrigation
    purposes is found to be doubtful to unsuitable category in some parts. The results
    help in demarcating artificial recharge sites in the studied region. In the study
    area, site-specific recharge and mitigation techniques such as roof-top rainwater
    harvesting, recharge pits, etc., should be adopted to enhance the water quantity
    and quality, hence further helping in the protection of groundwater resources.
    Moreover, defluorination and denitrification techniques should also be adopted
    in the study area for safe drinking water. Additionally, land-use planning, sustainable
    agricultural practices and irrigation techniques such as sprinkler and drip irrigation
    should be adopted to minimize groundwater contamination. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Interest in soil health and biodiversity conservation has become increasingly
    important. Consequently, studies comparing the chemical and biological characteristics
    of organic and traditional paddy soils have been increasing. Soil microorganisms
    are essential in nutrient cycling; however, their diversity is challenging to
    ascertain because of their environmental sensitivity and complex interactions.
    Particularly, in domestic rice cultivation, the soil undergoes multiple irrigation
    and drainage processes during crop growth, providing a diverse ecological environment
    for soil microorganisms. The objective of this study is to compare the microbial
    community and diversity between paddy soils in two agricultural systems. We selected
    organic and conventional paddy fields in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, and collected
    monthly samples from August to November 2022 for analysis. Bacteria and fungi
    were amplified from the 16S rRNA V3V4 region, ITS 3–4 region respectively, For
    the comparison of microbial diversity, Alpha diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon,
    Gini-Simpson indices) were analyzed. The results indicated genus-level differences
    in microbial communities, with the genera Mucor and Sirastachys exclusively present
    in organic paddy soils, while the genus Ustilaginoidea was exclusively found in
    conventional paddy soils. Among them, Ustilaginoidea is reported to be a fungus
    causing false smut disease, causing damage to crop growth and quality. Additionally,
    the comparison of microbial diversity between the two farming showed no significant
    differences (p>0.05). In conclusion, When the microbial communities present in
    both farming systems were examined, organic farming appeared to be more advantageous
    than conventional farming regarding crop disease and health. This study provides
    essential soil chemical and microbiological data for understanding the fundamental
    characteristics of paddy soils in South Korea.

    Soil microorganisms serve as soil health indicators, reflect natural and anthropogenic
    activities, and are essential in supplying soil nutrients via global chemical
    and biological cycles (Wang et al., 2016; Hermans et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,
    2019; Suman et al., 2022). Furthermore, some soil microorganisms, such as Bacillus
    and Penicillium, promote crops in absorbing nutrients and directly and indirectly
    affects crop growth by improving stress resistance and suppressing pathogens (Wang
    et al., 2016; Rasheeda et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2020; Suman et al., 2022). Specifically,
    soil microorganisms in the farming process potentially significantly enhance agricultural
    productivity and quality, promote soil health, and contribute to food security
    and safety (Park et al., 2011). Organic farming positively impacts the conservation
    of agricultural ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, improving crop health, and
    reducing the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers through the use of organic
    materials. In contrast, conventional farming, which is widely practiced in many
    agricultural areas worldwide, uses synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to achieve
    increased crop yields with relatively lower labor input. Depending on the farming
    approach, organic farming positively influences the biological aspects of soil
    health, including microbial activity and diversity. In contrast, conventional
    farming is associated with soil alterations due to the use of synthetic fertilizers
    and pesticides, which negatively affects biodiversity (Lupatini et al., 2017).
    However, the microbial species diversity in conventional farming soils is similar
    to that in organic farming (Lopes et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2015). Xu et al.
    (2022) conducted a comparative analysis of microbial diversity in relation to
    soil depth, revealing that organic soils at depths of 10 cm–20 cm exhibited higher
    microbial diversity compared to conventional agricultural soils. Additionally,
    Tian et al. (2015) compared the impact of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers
    using a control group, indicating that both organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers
    did not exert a significant influence on soil bacterial diversity. This is considered
    to be due to changes in species diversity, which are influenced by differences
    in farming practices as well as the collective influence of abiotic factors, such
    as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients, affecting microbial community changes
    (Fierer et al., 2012; Corneo et al., 2013; García-Orenes et al., 2013; Hartmann
    et al., 2015; Peltoniemi et al., 2021) Accordingly, microorganisms have recently
    attracted increasing attention as important factors in increasing biodiversity
    and sustainable agriculture (Suman et al., 2022), with studies being conducted
    to determine the relationship between changes in soil microorganisms owing to
    energy inputs such as fertilizer and compost (Giovannucci et al., 2012; Tian et
    al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Rhew et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). In South Korea,
    there is increasing interest in understanding the impact of soil microbial ecosystems
    in organic farming cultivation sites, and studies comparing them with conventional
    farming cultivation sites have been conducted (Choi et al., 2011; Kang et al.,
    2019; Kim et al., 2020). Unlike cultivated land such as paddy fields and orchards,
    Korean rice fields are cultivated for a certain period during crop growth, and
    many physicochemical and biological changes occur along with repeated changes
    in the oxidation and reduction environments in freshwater conditions, providing
    an ecosystem for various microorganisms to inhabit (Wang et al., 2021). Because
    of this specific ecosystem, it is important to understand the interaction between
    microorganisms, soil, and microorganisms in rice paddies compared to other agricultural
    lands. However, microbiological research data from domestic rice paddies remain
    insufficient. Considering the variations in each study, such as the surveyed locations,
    weather conditions, and farming practices, a significant amount of basic data
    is required. To understand the functional impacts of farming methods, understanding
    the mechanisms of microbial community interactions that change according to physicochemical
    and biological characteristics such as moisture, pH, inter-species competition,
    and cooperation is important (Lauber et al., 2009; Kodera et al., 2022; Nawaz
    et al., 2022). The objective of this study is to assess the ecological soil properties
    of organic and conventional paddy fields, elucidating the distinct characteristics
    of soils in both agricultural systems, and comparing the differences in microbial
    community composition and functions. Accordingly, this research 1) specifies the
    physicochemical and microbiological attributes of domestically cultivated organic
    and conventional paddy soils, and 2) compares the health status of these soils
    based on soil microbial diversity using biodiversity assessment indices, including
    Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description
    and sample collection Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, As in national statistical
    data for the year of 2022 indicating the rice paddies account for 47% of the total
    cultivation, in this research area. To compare the differences in microbial diversity
    between organic and conventional paddy fields, we chose the following survey locations:
    organic paddy farming (OP) located in Buyong, Yangseo (37°33′16.71″ N, 127°20′25.90″
    E), and conventional paddy farming (CP) located in Yangsu, Angseo (37°33′21.23″
    N, 127°19′50.94″ E) (Fig. 1). Organic paddy fields have been utilizing certified
    organic materials for the past 20 years and cultivating Milqueen, whereas conventional
    paddy fields are dedicated to growing Chamdreams. The planting distance for both
    the organic and conventional paddy soils was 23 cm × 23 cm, and the soil slope
    was 27%. The soil was characterized by a loamy texture. Four field surveys were
    conducted from August to November 2022: two during the farming season (August
    17 (#1), September 27 (#2)) and two during the harvest season (October 18 (#3),
    November 15 (#4)). The meteorological conditions during the survey period in 2022
    included an average temperature of 12.2 °C and a total precipitation of 2143.4
    mm. In the specific sampling sites (#1-#4), the temperatures and precipitation
    were as follows: 24 °C, 10.4 mm; 17.7 °C, 0 mm; 7.8 °C, 0 mm; and 5.7 °C, 2.6
    mm. Additionally, the 10-year antecedent precipitation (2011–2021) averaged 1264.4
    mm, and during the survey year, the precipitation during the survey year was higher
    than the annual average (Korea Meteorological Administration). During the field
    surveys, soil samples were randomly collected from three locations within a single
    site at a depth of 0–30 cm using an auger. The collected samples were placed in
    polyethylene bags, mixed, and immediately transported to the laboratory. After
    air-drying for seven days, the samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and used
    for analysis. Additionally, for DNA extraction, 3 g of soil samples were stored
    in 5 mL Eppendorf tubes at −50 °C. Download : Download high-res image (727KB)

    characteristics of soil samples For the physical properties (Table 1), we measured
    particle size, bulk density, and porosity. Particle size was analyzed using a
    Particle Size Analyzer, with the soil samples sieved to 1 mm. The measured results
    were classified according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    methods, and the soil texture was determined using a soil triangle. The bulk density
    was calculated by dividing the weight of dried soil, obtained after conditioning
    the collected core at 105 °C for 18 h, by the core volume (100 mL). The soil moisture
    content was measured using a soil moisture sensor (ZL6) at a depth of approximately
    15 cm from the ground. Table 1. The statistical characteristics of soil physicochemical

    ± 3 Regarding the soil chemical properties (Table 1), pH, electrical conductivity
    (EC), organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (Av. P2O5), exchangeable cations
    (Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were analyzed using the
    soil chemical analysis methods of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences
    (Kim et al., 2010). The pH and EC were measured after shaking by adding 25 mL
    of distilled water to 5 g of air-dried soil. OM was measured using the Walkley–Black
    method, and Av. P2O5 was prepared using the Bray No. 1 method. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+,
    and CEC were stirred for 30 min after adding 30 mL of 1 N NH4OAc to 3 g of 2 mm
    sieved soil samples. After stirring, 15 mL of the filtrate was added to HM No.
    50 filter paper, and the cation concentration was measured using ICP-OES. 2.3.
    DNA extraction, qPCR, and sequencing In this study, 0.25 g of a soil sample was
    used to extract DNA following the DNA extraction protocol of the DNeasy Power
    Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). gDNA (2 ng) was PCR-amplified using Herculase
    II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with 5 × reaction
    buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, and universal F/R PCR primers at 500 nM each. The first PCR
    cycle conditions involved heating at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles at
    95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension step
    at 72 °C for 5 min. The initial PCR product was purified using AMPure beads (Agencourt
    Biosciences). Following purification, a 2 μL aliquot of the first PCR product
    was subjected to a second PCR amplification to construct the final library with
    included indices using NexteraXT Indexed Primers. The cycling conditions for the
    second PCR were the same as those for the first PCR, except for 10 cycles. The
    PCR product was purified using AMPure beads, and the final purified product was
    quantified according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide (KAPA Library Quantification
    kits for Illumina Sequencing platforms). Quality was verified using a TapeStation
    D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Sequencing was performed
    using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Microbial community analysis
    was conducted using metagenome amplicon sequencing, a next-generation sequencing
    method that amplified and sequenced the 16S rRNA V3V4 (341F 805R) region and fungal
    amplification and sequencing of the ITS 3F 4R region. After completing the sequencing
    process, Illumina MiSeq raw data were sorted by sample using the index sequences,
    and sample-specific paired-end FASTQ files were generated. We conducted a preprocessing
    step using Cutadapt (v3.2) to remove sequencing adapter sequences and F/R primer
    sequences from the target gene regions. Subsequently, for 16S rRNA, the forward
    sequences (Read1) were trimmed to 250 bp and the reverse sequences (Read2) to
    200 bp, while for ITS, both Forward and Reverse sequences were trimmed to 250
    bp (Martin, 2011). To correct for errors in the amplicon sequencing process, we
    employed the DADA2 (v1.18.0) package within R (v4.0.3), excluding sequences with
    expected errors greater than two in paired-end reads (Callahan et al., 2016).
    After completing the preprocessing phase, batch-specific error models were established
    to remove sample-specific noise. The corrected paired-end sequences were assembled
    into a single sequence, and the DADA2 Consensus method was used to eliminate chimeric
    sequences and form Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). For 16S rRNA, ASVs less
    than 350 bp were excluded using R (v4.0.3), whereas, for ITS analysis, a length
    filter was not applied to the generated ASVs. To perform a comparative microbial
    community analysis, we employed QIIME (v1.9) to normalize the entire set of samples
    by subsampling based on the read count of the sample with the lowest number of
    reads (Caporaso et al., 2010). Each ASV sequence was subjected to a BLAST+ (v2.9.0)
    search against the reference database (NCBI 16S Microbial DB) to assign taxonomic
    information to the organism with the highest similarity to the subject. In this
    process, taxonomy information was not assigned if the query coverage of the best
    hit was less than 85% or if the matched region''s identity was less than 85% (Camacho
    et al., 2009). In the ITS analysis, each ASV sequence was subjected to UCLUST
    against the reference database (UNITE 8.2 2020-02-04 UNITE + INSD All Eukaryotes
    & UNITE 8.2 2020-02-20 Fungi2 99% clustering) to perform taxonomic assignments
    based on the organism information of the most similar reference. In this process,
    the assigned references had a sequence similarity of 90% or higher with the query
    (Edgar, 2010). Furthermore, for multiple alignments of ASV sequences, we used
    the MAFFT (v7.475) program and generated a phylogenetic tree using the FastTreeMP
    (v2.1.10) program (Price et al., 2010; Katoh et al., 2013). Using the aforementioned
    ASV abundances and taxonomic information, we conducted various microbial community
    comparative analyses using QIIME. Additionally, to assess species diversity and
    evenness within the microbial clusters in our samples, we calculated Shannon and
    Inverse Simpson indices and explored alpha diversity using rarefaction curves
    and Chao1 values. 2.4. Comparative analysis of soil microbial community diversity
    and statistical assessment We employed alpha diversity analysis as a metric to
    evaluate the richness, evenness, and overall diversity of species within our samples
    (Table 3). Chao1 was calculated to assess species richness in soil microbial communities
    between organic (OP) and conventional (CP) treatments, whereas Shannon and Simpson
    indices were computed to compare species diversity. We used SPSS (version 26)
    to perform Mann–Whitney t-tests to examine differences in the distribution proportions
    and diversity indices of the organic and conventional soil microbiota. Furthermore,
    we applied the Venn Diagram packge in R (version 4.3.1) to show the shared and
    unique genera in organic and conventional farming (Fig. 3), and the Corrplot package
    in R (version 4.3.1) to construct a correlation matrix based on Spearman''s correlation,
    highlighting the relationships between microbial species and chemical properties
    at significance levels of p<0.05, p<0.01, and p<0.001 (Fig. 4). Table 2. The seasonal

    ± 0.78 0.961 ± 0.020 Chao1 is an indicator used to estimate species richness in
    a given sample based on ASV values. A higher Chao1 value suggests a greater richness
    of species, indicating the presence of many unanalyzed species (Kielak et al.,
    2009; Han et al., 2022), as represented by Equation (1): (1) where is the estimated
    richness, is the observed number of species, n1 is the number of ASVs in one sequence,
    and n2 is the number of ASVs shared between two sequences. The Shannon index was
    used to assess the uncertainty of the predictions regarding random species in
    the target area. An increasing Shannon index value signifies higher species diversity
    within the target area (Lee et al., 2018), as represented by Equation (2): (2)
    where is the proportion of species i within the total number of individuals in
    a cluster, and H′ is the Shannon index. The Simpson index signifies the probability
    that two randomly selected individuals in a sample belong to the same species,
    with a value close to one indicating lower diversity. In this context, a Simpson
    index value approaching 1 represents a higher diversity, as in Equation (3): (3)
    where is the proportion of species i within the total number of individuals in
    a cluster, and C is the Simpson index. 3. Results 3.1. Analysis of soil physicochemical
    characteristics in the study area We sampled organic and conventional soils four
    times in each season, and the results for the physicochemical characteristics
    of the soil are presented in Table 1. The textures of the organic and conventional
    soils were classified as sandy or loamy. For soil physical properties, bulk density
    in organic fields was highest at #2 and #3 (1.45 g cm−3), while in conventional
    fields, it was highest at #2 (1.24 g cm−3), and on average, bulk density was 1.4
    g cm−3 in organic paddy fields and 1.03 g cm−3 in conventional paddy fields. Water
    Content in organic fields reached its peak at #4 (41.2%), whereas in conventional
    fields, it was highest at #1 and #2 (38.7%), and on average, water content was
    35.4% in organic fields and 38.2% in conventional fields. For soil chemical properties
    (Table 1), pH was highest in organic fields and conventional fields at #4 (6.9)
    and #2 (5.8) respectively, and on average, pH was higher in organic paddy fields
    at 6.6 compared to 5.4 in conventional paddy fields. EC was highest in organic
    fields at #2 and #3 (0.33 dS m−1), while conventional fields recorded the highest
    value at #3 (0.56 dS m−1). On average, EC was higher in conventional paddy fields,
    measuring 0.42 dS m−1 compared to 0.29 dS m−1 in organic fields. Av. P2O5 was
    highest in organic fields at 346 mg kg−1 and in conventional fields at 242 mg
    kg−1, both at #2. On average, Av. P2O5 was 137 ± 145 mg kg−1 in organic fields
    and 146 ± 99 mg kg−1 in conventional fields. Soil organic matter was highest in
    organic fields at #2 (3.8%) and in conventional fields at #4 (3.3%). On average,
    OM content was 2.7% in organic fields and 1.9% in conventional fields. Additionally,
    Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ were 4.94, 0.96, and 0.23 cmol+·g−1 in organic paddy fields
    and 3.08, 0.82, and 0.22 cmol+·g−1 in conventional paddy fields, respectively.
    CEC was 11.03 cmol+·g−1 in organic fields and 10.46 cmol+·g−1 in conventional
    fields. 3.2. Soil microbial community composition In the organic paddy soils,
    337,731 bacterial and 474,319 fungal raw data reads were processed, resulting
    in the inclusion of 6026 bacterial and 3951 fungal ASVs (#1 to #4). In conventional
    paddy soils, 363,181 raw bacterial data and 438,209 raw fungal data reads were
    processed, resulting in the inclusion of 6637 bacterial and 3960 fungal ASVs (#1
    to #4). To compare the soil bacteria and fungi community composition ratios between
    OP and CP, we illustrated the results in Fig. 2. In the Bacteria graph, species
    other than the top 8 dominant species and those with Query Coverage less than
    85% or Identity Percentage less than 85% under Blast conditions were classified
    as ''Other''. In the Fungi graph, species appearing as ''Unassigned'' or ''Unidentified''
    were categorized as ''Other''. At the phylum level (Fig. 2), both organic and
    conventional paddy soils showed Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria,
    Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae as dominant phyla, with additional analyses revealing
    the presence of Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes (Fig. 2, OP#1b to CP#4b). Organic
    paddy soils were dominated by Proteobacteria (34.4%), Chloroflexi (15.6%), Actinobacteria
    (12.0%), Acidobacteria (7.3%), Firmicutes (6.5%), Nitrospirae (4.1%), Verrucomicrobia
    (1.8%), Planctomycetes (1.5%), and Bacteroidetes (1.4%). Conventional paddy soils
    were dominated by Proteobacteria (31.9%), Chloroflexi (14.3%), Actinobacteria
    (13.5%), Firmicutes (9.4%), Acidobacteria (7.0%), Bacteroidetes (3.0%), Nitrospirae
    (2.9%), Verrucomicrobia (1.6%), and Planctomycetes (0.9%). At the phylum level
    (Fig. 2, OP#1f to CP#4f), Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal
    phyla, with additional analyses revealing the presence of Mucoromycota and Mortierellomycota.
    In the organic paddy soils, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (4.7%), Basidiomycota
    (1.4%), Mucoromycota (0.53%), and Mortierellomycota (0.07%). In conventional paddy
    soils, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (18.1%), Basidiomycota (0.46%), Mortierellomycota
    (0.14%), and Mucoromycota (0.01%). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    level, Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, Vicinamibacter, and Clostridium
    were the most commonly distributed genera in both agricultural soils (Table 2).
    At the genus level, the top three species of Thermomarinylinea, Thermodesulfovibrio,
    and Vicinamibacter, were dominant in organic paddy soils, whereas Clostridium,
    Thermomarinylinea, and Vicinamibacter were dominant in conventional paddy soils
    (Table 2, Group of Bacteria). At the fungal genus level, Clohesyomyces, Sirastachys,
    and Penicillium were the most commonly distributed genera in both agricultural
    soils. The top three species of Limnoperdon, Tomentella, and Clohesyomyces were
    dominant in organic paddy soils, whereas the top three species of Ustilaginoidea,
    Plectosphaerella, and Pyrenochaetopsis were dominant in conventional paddy soils
    (Table 2, Group of Fungi). Other microbial species classified as ''Other'' with
    high distribution were excluded. 3.3. Microbial communities and diversity 3.3.1.
    ASV venn diagram We analyzed the distribution of unique and shared species of
    bacteria and fungi in the organic and conventional paddy soils by representing
    the analyzed ASVs in a Venn diagram (Fig. 3). When comparing the bacterial clusters
    in conventional paddy soils, the ASV numbers for #1 to #4 were 1117, 1065, 1085,
    and 1365, respectively, whereas those for organic paddy soils were 1141, 667,
    856, and 1357, respectively (Fig. 3, (a)–(d)). Notably, organic paddy soils exhibited
    a more sensitive response to temporal variation than conventional paddy soils.
    When comparing fungal clusters in conventional paddy soils, the ASV numbers for
    #1 to #4 were 1106, 746, 340, and 836, whereas in organic paddy soils, they were
    889, 626, 803, and 668, respectively (Fig. 3, (e)–(h)). Conventional paddy soils
    exhibited a more sensitive response to temporal variations than organic paddy
    soils. Shared species refers to the number of microbial species commonly observed
    in both organic and conventional paddy soils during the growing season, showing
    a decreasing trend, followed by recovery after harvest. 3.3.2. Microbial alpha
    diversity We assessed the microbial diversity of organic and conventional paddy
    soils across seasons (#1 to #4) using the Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices.
    The results are presented in Table 3. Additionally, Good''s coverage for bacteria
    ranged from 0.998 to 0.999, and for fungi, it ranged from 0.999 to 1, indicating
    that the sequences adequately represented the respective environments. Although
    variations existed in the diversity index results across seasons, when comparing
    bacterial alpha diversity (Table 3, Group of Bacteria), an average of 1507 ± 419
    and 1659 ± 259 ASVs were found in the organic and conventional soils, respectively.
    Chao1 was 1513 ± 426 in organic and 1666 ± 259 in conventional soils, while the
    Shannon index was 9.71 ± 0.35 and 9.94 ± 0.24, respectively. The average Simpson
    index was 0.998 for both species. Comparing fungal alpha diversity (Table 3, Group
    of Fungi), the number of ASVs was 988 ± 170 in organic and 990 ± 409 in conventional
    soils. Chao1 values were 988 ± 169 and 990 ± 409, Shannon index values were 7.27
    ± 0.20 and 6.89 ± 0.78, and Simpson index values were 0.971 ± 0.004 and 0.961
    ± 0.020, respectively. 3.4. Effects of soil chemical properties on microbial communities
    We conducted a comparative analysis of seven soil chemical properties (pH, EC,
    AP (Av. P2O5), OM, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+), and dominant species in the soil (At the
    Phylum level, nine at the bacteria and two at the fungi, at the Genus level, four
    at the bacteria and three at the fungi) (Fig. 4). The statistically significant
    taxa (p < 0.05) included Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes,
    Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes at the bacterial phylum level,
    and at the fungal phylum level, the significant taxon (p < 0.05) was Ascomycota
    (Fig. 4A). At the genus level (Fig. 4B), we selected four dominant bacteria and
    three fungal taxa that were dominant during seasons #1–#4. Taxa that exhibited
    statistical significance included Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, and
    Clostridium genera for bacteria, and the genus Ustilaginoidea for fungi. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Soil physicochemical properties Soil bulk density affects aeration and water
    retention and reduces microbial populations as it increases (Li et al., 2002,
    2021; G. B. Li et al., 2021). According to Cho et al. (2012), the average bulk
    density of paddy soils in South Korea is 1.22 g cm−3 for topsoil and 1.47 g cm−3
    for subsoil. Compared to our research results on the subsoil, the organic paddy
    soil investigated in this study showed values similar to the typical bulk density
    of paddy soils in South Korea, whereas lower values were observed for conventional
    paddy soils. However, the standard for improving the physicality of paddy soil
    is recommended to be 1.20 Mg m−3 or less based on topsoil (Kim et al., 2013; Cho
    et al., 2018), and for conventional paddy soil, except for #2, all other seasons
    satisfy this standard. However, organic paddy soils exceeded the criteria in all
    seasons, indicating the need for appropriate soil management to reduce bulk density.
    pH is one of the factors that can limit microbial growth and influence the survival
    of specific bacterial or fungal species (Rousk et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2022).
    Rousk et al. (2009) demonstrated that pH is correlated with bacteria and fungi,
    showing an increase in bacteria and a decrease in fungi at higher pH levels. However,
    our study presented contrasting results, as pH was lower in conventional paddy
    soils (5.4 ± 0.3) compared to organic paddy soils (6.6 ± 0.2); however, bacteria
    showed a higher distribution in conventional paddy soils, and fungi exhibited
    a higher distribution in organic paddy soils. These results suggest that pH is
    not the dominant factor driving changes in microbial communities and can be considered
    as one of the factors that exert an indirect influence. When compared to the soil
    fertility adequacy standards set by the Rural Development Administration, organic
    paddy soils showed values higher than the appropriate range (5.5–6.5). In contrast,
    conventional paddy soils did not meet the adequacy standards and showed values
    below the appropriate range. In the organic paddies, there was a trend of increasing
    pH over time, whereas a decreasing trend was observed for the conventional paddies.
    This phenomenon is attributed to the use of inorganic fertilizers in conventional
    farming, which tend to acidify the soil, and organic fertilizers, which are associated
    with shifting the soil pH to neutral (Rachwał et al., 2021). Av. P2O5 in organic
    and conventional paddy soils was 137 ± 145 and 146 ± 99 mg kg−1, respectively.
    Except for OP #4, all other periods exceeded the optimal range (80–120 mg kg−1),
    indicating the need for proper soil management during the crop-growing season.
    In the case of conventional paddy soils, OM was below the optimal range (2–3%)
    during the crop growth stages (#1 and #2). The values of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ showed
    seasonal differences in both organic and conventional paddy soils and the properties,
    excluding K+ did not meet all of the appropriate criteria (5.0–6.0, 1.5–2.0, and
    0.2–0.3 cmol+·g−1). 4.2. Microbial communities in soil Microorganisms play a crucial
    role in maintaining soil health, and their functional impact on soil and crops
    varies depending on the classification of the soil microorganisms. Among them,
    bacteria contribute significantly to plant health and soil fertility and are considered
    early warning indicators of soil health because of their sensitivity to environmental
    changes (Hayat et al., 2010; Rachwał et al., 2021). In this study, the dominant
    phyla, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes,
    accounted for approximately 76% of the total population. This trend is similar
    to the dominant phyla observed in previous studies by Xu et al. (2022) and Zhang
    et al. (2019). The most abundant group in paddy soil, Proteobacteria, is a Gram-negative
    bacteria and is considered the most abundant microorganism in soil ecosystems,
    playing a central role in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. Metabolically,
    they possess diverse capabilities (Mhete et al., 2020). The second most abundant
    group, Chloroflexi, is involved in carbon cycling and can break down plant compounds
    through cellulose, starch, long-chain sugars, and pyrogallol degradation pathways
    (Hug et al., 2013). In addition, the phylum Acidobacteria is involved in soil
    organic carbon cycling and nutrient mineralization, particularly in low-fertility
    areas, acting as a keystone microorganism and facilitating nitrogen supply source
    metabolism (Kang et al., 2019; Kalam et al., 2020). The phylum Actinobacteria
    is essential in the cycling of organic compounds and is associated with soil organic
    matter production, including melanin and soil humic acid (Mhete et al., 2020).
    Nitropirae can oxidize nitrite and convert NO2− to NO3−, making nutrients available
    to plants. It also appears to be relatively abundant at high pH, and the higher
    the ratio, the more active the soil nitrogen circulation (Zhang et al., 2019).
    Furthermore, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia,
    Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi are recognized as microorganisms capable of producing
    alkaline phosphatase and play crucial roles in nutrient cycling (Durrer et al.,
    2021). Fungi, which function as decomposers and symbionts, play a pivotal role
    in the decomposition of organic matter, carbon and nitrogen cycling, and in promoting
    plant growth and suppressing plant pathogens (Karanja et al., 2020). Moreover,
    they can thrive under a range of soil pH, temperature, and moisture conditions,
    and fungal diversity is regulated by both biological factors, such as plants and
    organisms, as well as abiotic factors, such as soil pH, temperature, and moisture
    levels (Frąc et al., 2018). In this study, the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota
    were detected in organic and conventional soils, the phylum Mucoromycota was analyzed
    in organic soils, and the phylum Mortierellomycota was analyzed in conventional
    soils. Ascomycota, which emerged as the dominant phylum in both organic and conventional
    soil, exerts beneficial effects such as improved root and plant establishment,
    nutrient cycling, soil structure enhancement, increased resistance to stress,
    and enhanced slow ion absorption, making it an important microbe for the decomposition
    of lignocellulosic organic matter in soils (Frąc et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
    The phylum Basidiomycota is known for its role in lignin decomposition and is
    considered to accelerate nutrient uptake through ectomycorrhizal formation (Hervé
    et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022). In contrast to previous studies that indicated
    a prevalent distribution of Ascomycota in organic agricultural soils, this study
    found a high prevalence of Ascomycota in conventional agricultural soils. In CF#3f,
    the phylum Ascomycota constituted approximately 36% of the total bacterial population.
    The high prevalence in this sample was attributed to the significant distribution
    of the genus Ustilaginoidea, a subordinate taxon within the phylum Ascomycota.
    In this study, the average microbial distribution ratios of the organic and conventional
    soil samples from periods #1 to #4 were compared using t-tests. However, no significant
    differences (p>0.05) were observed among the eight dominant bacterial species.
    In contrast, of the dominant 4 fungal species, only the phylum Mucoromycota exhibited
    a significant difference (p<0.05) between the two agricultural soil types. At
    the genus level, organic paddy fields were predominantly characterized by the
    dominance of the genera Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, and Vicinamibacter
    throughout the survey period, with Clostridium becoming the dominant species in
    period #2. In the conventional paddy soils, the genera Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio,
    Vicinamibacter, Bellilinea, Clostridium, and Acidobacterium were observed, and
    all four monitoring periods (#1 to #4) exhibited variability in the dominant cluster
    composition (Table 2, Group of Bacteria). The genus Thermomarinilinea, observed
    in organic and conventional paddy soils, is capable of methane production through
    anaerobic metabolism (Yang et al., 2021), and the genus Thermodesulfovibrio is
    a sulfate-reducing microbe, utilizing sulfate as an electron acceptor to generate
    sulfides (Liang et al., 2016). Furthermore, the genus Vicinamibacter contributes
    to soil nitrogen cycling and solubilization (Wu et al., 2021). The genus Clostridium,
    which is abundant in conventional paddy soils, is an anaerobic microorganism found
    in various environments, including the host''s intestines, excreta, and soil,
    capable of nitrogen fixation without a host, and promotes crop growth and produces
    antimicrobial metabolites (Polyanskaya et al., 2002; Pahalagedara et al., 2020).
    At the fungal genus level, Clohesyomyces, Penicillium, Mucor, and Sirastachys
    were predominant in the organic paddy fields, whereas Clohesyomyces, Ustilaginoidea,
    Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella were dominant in the conventional paddy fields
    (Table 2, Group of Fungi). This indicates a distinct microbial community composition
    between organic and conventional paddy fields. The genera Mucor and Sirastachys
    were found exclusively in the organic paddy soils, while the genus Ustilaginoidea
    was found exclusively in the conventional paddy soils. Among them, the genus Ustilaginoidea
    is a plant pathogen that causes false smut in rice, which negatively affects both
    yield and quality, and its toxins can adversely affect humans and animals (Shim
    et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2020; G. Li et al., 2021). Additionally, the genera
    Mucor and Sirastachys are commonly found in the soil and decaying crops (Ziaee
    et al., 2016; Samarakoon et al., 2021), and the genus Penicillium is a key soil
    fungus contributing to soil nitrogen cycling, producing siderophores and plant
    hormones, and playing a biological control role against plant pathogens (Hao et
    al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2021). These results at the microbial
    genus level indicate that conventional agriculture may be more susceptible to
    biological control and pest suppression compared to organic agriculture. In rice
    paddy cultivation in South Korea, irrigation and drainage processes significantly
    influence the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in organic and conventional
    paddy soils. Under flooded conditions, the soil is reduced, and the soil microbial
    community is composed of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize compounds such
    as nitrates and sulfates as electron acceptors (Hester et al., 2022). Furthermore,
    at the genus level, this study found that anaerobic microorganisms such as Thermomarinilinea,
    Thermodesulfovibrio, and Clostridium dominated the microbial community. Additionally,
    changes in bacterial and fungal communities during the drainage period occur unpredictably,
    and shifts in the fungal community appear to be more sensitive to the drainage
    period than those of bacteria (Xue et al., 2021). The paddy soils in this study,
    influenced by freshwater-induced reducing conditions, primarily shaped the dominant
    species distribution as anaerobic microorganisms, resulting in similar bacterial
    community composition in the two agricultural soils. However, at the fungal genus
    level, variations were observed, showing a trend similar to that reported in previous
    studies. The fungal species that exhibited sensitivity to freshwater-induced community
    changes require further research, as there have been limited investigations into
    their impact on the soil compared to bacterial species. This study emphasizes
    the importance of identifying the subordinate taxa species occurring in each agricultural
    soil and verifying the functions of the occurring species. 4.3. Microbial community
    structure and diversity analysis Biodiversity is associated with and contributes
    functionally to ecosystems and is used as an indicator to assess the state of
    soil (Reese et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022). Microbial diversity is related to
    ecosystem functions, such as biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem functions have
    been reported to become more active when microbes are abundant and diverse (Wagg
    et al., 2019). Alpha diversity measures the richness, evenness, and diversity
    of the microorganisms within a sample (Liu et al., 2022). The bacterial diversity
    exhibited a decreasing trend over time, followed by recovery, as shown in Fig.
    3. H. Li et al. (2021) investigated the effects of watering frequency on bacterial
    community composition and diversity. As the frequency of watering increased, the
    proportion of specific bacterial phyla also increased. This suggests that with
    continued frequent watering, the community composition of facultative microorganisms
    shifts towards more anaerobic microorganisms, resulting in a decrease in microbial
    richness and an increase in the dominance ratio of certain microbes, ultimately
    leading to a reduction in the Shannon index. When comparing organic and conventional
    soils, differences in ASV decline over time were observed (Fig. 3, Table 3), and
    bacterial communities appear to be modulated by organic farming practices, while
    fungal communities are regulated by conventional farming. This was attributed
    to changes in soil properties owing to the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
    Suzuki et al. (2019) reported temporal changes in the bacterial community composition
    under organic management during crop growth, and some studies have suggested that
    the microbial community composition in paddy soils is influenced by the use of
    organic and inorganic fertilizers (Wang et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018; Suzuki
    et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2017) and Kumar et al. (2018) reported that the use
    of organic and inorganic fertilizers altered the physicochemical characteristics
    of the soil and indirectly influenced microbial community composition. In terms
    of fungal diversity, the differences were more pronounced numerically than those
    in bacterial diversity. Similarly, it was inferred that the changes and compositional
    differences in the microbial community in the present study were influenced by
    freshwater and organic and inorganic fertilizers. Comparing bacterial and fungal
    diversity of organic and conventional paddy soils, the richness (ASVs and Chao1)
    in bacterial diversity was higher in conventional paddy soils (1659 ± 259 and
    1666 ± 259) than in organic paddy soils (1507 ± 419 and 1513 ± 426). Shannon index
    showed a higher value in conventional paddy soils (9.94 ± 0.24) compared to organic
    paddy soils (9.97 ± 0.35), and the Simpson index resulted in the same value of
    0.998. In terms of fungal diversity, richness (ASVs, Chao1) and diversity (Simpson)
    were not significantly different between the organic and conventional paddy soils.
    The Shannon index was higher in organic paddy soils (7.27 ± 0.20) compared to
    conventional paddy soils (6.89 ± 0.78). Consequently, fungi in organic and conventional
    paddy soils exhibited no differences in richness, while organic paddy soils showed
    a more even and diverse distribution of fungi than conventional paddy soils. This
    contradicts the results of some studies that have shown higher fungal diversity
    in conventional agriculture (Chen et al., 2022). However, when a t-test was performed
    at a significance level of p<0.05, the diversity (ASVs, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson
    indices) of organic and conventional agricultural soils showed no significant
    differences. The findings of this study revealed contrasting results to previous
    research indicating higher microbial diversity in organic soils compared to conventional
    farming practices. This contradicts some studies suggesting that microbial diversity
    in organic soils tends to increase initially but gradually decreases over the
    first few years (van Diepeningen et al., 2006; Hartmann et al., 2015; Bonanomi
    et al., 2016; Khatri et al., 2023). In light of such cases, our study suggests
    that the prolonged 20-year practice of organic farming has influenced a decline
    in microbial diversity. Furthermore, comparing microbial diversity in organic
    and conventional soils is challenging due to variations in field conditions, experimental
    designs, and other factors, as demonstrated by Khatri et al. (2023). 4.4. The
    correlation between soil chemical properties and microorganisms Understanding
    the effect of microorganisms on soil properties and the influence of physicochemical
    factors on microbial communities is essential. Proteobacteria, representing the
    majority of the phylum Bacteria, showed a significant positive correlation (p<0.05)
    with OM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. Nitrospirae, which plays a crucial
    role in soil nitrogen cycling, exhibited significant positive correlations (p<0.05,
    p<0.01) with pH, Ca2+, and Mg2+, with correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.64,
    and 0.48, respectively, whereas EC and K+ showed significant negative correlations
    (p<0.05) with values of −0.55 and −0.05, respectively. Furthermore, other microbial
    taxa were significantly correlated with the chemical properties. At the phylum
    level, factors such as pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ had a substantial influence
    on the microbial community composition, whereas at the genus level, EC, Ca2+,
    Mg2+, and K+ affected the microbial distribution. The genus Thermomarinilinea,
    which accounts for a significant proportion of organic and conventional paddy
    soils, belongs to the subtaxon of the phylum Chloroflexi and is strongly influenced
    by EC. The genus Ustilaginoidea, a subtaxon of the phylum Ascomycota, exhibited
    significant correlations (p<0.05) with pH and EC and a distinct negative correlation
    (p<0.01) with Ca2+. Furthermore, the genus Ustilaginoidea exhibited a negative
    correlation with pH and Ca2+ but a positive correlation with EC. This suggests
    that the presence of Ustilaginoidea was influenced by nitrogen fertilizer, as
    observed when the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on the soil (pH, Ca2+ decrease,
    and EC increase) were considered (Bae et al., 2015). Understanding the relationship
    between soil chemical properties and microbiota allows us to determine the appropriate
    fertilizer application during the rice growth process, which can help regulate
    beneficial or detrimental microbial communities for soil and crop health. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, we compared the physical, chemical, and microbial characteristics
    of soils under organic and conventional farming practices on paddy from the farming
    season to the harvest period. It is essential to understand the changes in soil
    microorganisms over time. Our study revealed a gradual decrease followed by recovery
    in the abundance of Bacteria species in organic farming, and a similar trend was
    observed in the Fungi communities in conventional farming. This suggests that
    the Bacteria communities is regulated by organic farming, while the Fungi communities
    is influenced by conventional farming practices. The microbial community analysis
    revealed that the bacterial communities exhibited a similar communities composition
    between organic and conventional farming. However, the fungal communities showed
    distinct differences at the genus level. In organic soil, the predominant genera
    included Penicillium, Clohesyomyces, Mucor, and Sirastachys. In contrast, conventional
    soil during the same period was predominantly dominated by genera such as Clohesyomyces,
    Ustilaginoidea, Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella. Additionally, Mucor and Sirastachys
    were exclusively observed in organic soil, while Ustilaginoidea was exclusively
    observed in conventional soil. Notably, Ustilaginoidea is reported as a pathogen
    causing rice false smut, implying that changes in soil characteristics due to
    conventional farming practices may induce the proliferation of pathogens. These
    research findings emphasize that organic farming has potential advantages compared
    to conventional farming practices in terms of crop disease resistance and overall
    health. However, microbial diversity did not show significant differences between
    organic and conventional farming for both bacteria and fungi (p>0.05). The increase
    in microbial species diversity has been reported to have a positive impact on
    agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, evaluating the ecological value of organic
    and conventional agricultural soils solely based on diversity index analysis is
    challenging due to various factors such as experimental design and soil characteristics
    that can influence microbial diversity. To address this, identifying microbial
    taxa at lower taxonomic levels and understanding their functions and impacts on
    soil is important. The results of this study are expected to provide foundational
    data for establishing microbial databases of organisms present in organic and
    conventional paddy soils. Continuous monitoring is necessary to identify the indicator
    species specific to organic and conventional paddy soils. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Groundwater monitoring is essential for sustainable groundwater resource
    management in a country like Bangladesh, where this precious resource is gradually
    declining due to over-extraction. However, traditional methods of acquiring groundwater
    level (GWL) data over a large area are time-consuming and expensive. To address
    this, this study proposes an alternative approach using freely available daily
    groundwater storage (GWS) gridded data from the Global Land Data Assimilation
    System (GLDAS) and other data sources such as population, rainfall, temperature,
    irrigation, and elevation. By employing different regression and machine learning
    models like multiple linear regression (MLR), regression trees, support vector
    machines (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks
    (ANN), the study aimed to model GWL data for Bangladesh at a spatial resolution
    of 0.25° × 0.25°. In-situ weekly GWL data collected from 844 locations across
    the country were used for model development. The results indicated that GWS data
    alone was insufficient to estimate the spatial variability and trend of groundwater
    in Bangladesh. However, the comparison of different models showed that the ANN
    model performed better, with an overall correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 and
    mean squared error (MSE) of 0.64 m2 when estimating GWL using GWS and other data.
    The study also identified population and rainfall as the most influential factors
    in determining GWL. The developed ANN model can be utilized to estimate GWL at
    locations where observation data are unavailable, enabling the monitoring of GWL
    for sustainable groundwater management in Bangladesh.

    land data assimilation system 1. Introduction Groundwater monitoring is crucial
    for global water resource management, especially in regions with intensive groundwater
    use. Bangladesh is a highly populated country that heavily relies on groundwater
    as a vital water source (Salem et al., 2018). Approximately 32 km3 of groundwater
    is extracted annually in the country, accounting for nearly 4% of global groundwater
    withdrawal (Hanasaki et al., 2018). The majority of this abstracted water, around
    90%, is used for irrigation purposes (Conti et al., 2016). The rapid expansion
    of irrigated agriculture has led to a significant increase in irrigation demand,
    resulting in the overexploitation of groundwater resources. The consequences of
    groundwater overexploitation in Bangladesh have been numerous, affecting both
    hydrological and socioeconomic aspects. These include declining water levels,
    water quality degradation, wells drying up, reduced pumpage in household water
    supply wells, increased pumping costs, land subsidence, and aquifer compaction
    (Banerjee et al., 2009). To address these issues, it is crucial to prioritize
    sustainable groundwater abstraction practices that aim to maintain groundwater
    levels (Shahid and Hazarika, 2010a). Achieving sustainable groundwater management
    requires regular observations of groundwater levels throughout the entire country.
    However, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), responsible for regulating
    and monitoring both surface and groundwater supplies, maintains a network of >1300
    groundwater observation wells. Unfortunately, the data collected by BWDB is not
    readily available to the public, and accessing it can be expensive, especially
    when considering larger areas and longer periods. Additionally, the data requires
    extensive processing, compilation, and quality assurance, including selecting
    reliable data from hydrographs and filling in missing values, making it time-consuming
    to use BWDB data. Therefore, there is a need for an easily accessible, feasible,
    and reliable data source or model that can provide accurate and dependable estimates
    of groundwater levels. Such a resource would greatly facilitate sustainable groundwater
    resource management efforts in Bangladesh. Global Land Data Assimilation System
    (GLDAS) gridded groundwater storage (GWS) data can be a cost-effective alternative
    to a costly groundwater monitoring network. By incorporating advanced data assimilation
    methods and land surface modeling, GLDAS combines ground-based and satellite observational
    data to generate comprehensive information on land surface fluxes and states (Rodell
    et al., 2004). It provides global modeled earth surface and atmospheric data at
    spatial resolutions of 0.25° × 0.25° and 1° × 1° from 1948 to the present (Rui
    et al., 2019). The GLDAS-2.0 specifically simulates shallow groundwater and is
    readily available. Several studies conducted in different regions have demonstrated
    its effectiveness as a substitute for in-situ data (Bi and Ma, 2015; Chen et al.,
    2013; Fu and Wang, 2014; Rodell et al., 2007; Rzepecka et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
    2016; Zhou et al., 2013). However, the reliability of GWS data for Bangladesh
    has not been validated due to the lack of comprehensive studies. Previous research
    primarily focused on groundwater level (GWL) data and was limited to specific
    regions, making it difficult to assess the overall groundwater status of the country.
    Additionally, no study has utilized GWS data to demonstrate its ability to estimate
    the groundwater status countrywide. Also, no successful attempt has been made
    to generate a reliable predictive model to calculate GWL with acceptable accuracy
    using freely available physio-climatic variables. Accurately predicting GWL is
    crucial for the sustainable management and utilization of essential groundwater
    resources. However, it is challenging due to the complex and spatially variable
    nature of hydrogeological processes. Modeling groundwater fluctuations involves
    both conceptual and process-based techniques, with process-based models requiring
    extensive data (Coulibaly et al., 2001; Nikolos et al., 2008). Despite significant
    efforts and investments, distributed numerical flow models have not significantly
    improved the accuracy of GWL prediction (Coppola et al., 2005a). To address this,
    a dynamic predictive model that considers persistent trends and time-varying behaviors
    of hydrological variables is preferred for effective water resource planning and
    management. Empirical models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), regression
    trees, SVM, GPR, and ANN offer promising solutions (Ahmadi et al., 2022; Di Salvo,
    2022; Hussein et al., 2020; Osman et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
    2020). They provide relevant findings with fewer data points, require less effort,
    and are more affordable. Despite their limitations in addressing nonlinear relationships,
    MLR models have been widely used in hydrological studies due to their simplicity
    and ease of interpretation (Adeloye, 2009). On the other hand, ANN has gained
    popularity in recent years for its ability to model nonlinear input-output relationships.
    Numerous studies have shown that ANN can accurately estimate GWL (Afan et al.,
    2015; Derbela and Nouiri, 2020; Iqbal et al., 2020; Jeihouni et al., 2019; Kim
    and Lee, 2022; Kouziokas et al., 2018; Maier and Dandy, 2000; Mukherjee and Ramachandran,
    2018; Wunsch et al., 2018). Rajaee et al. (2019) reviewed many studies on modeling
    GWL using ANN and demonstrated its advantages over traditional methods. It provides
    better prediction by effectively capturing the nonlinear and dynamic characteristics
    of the system without requiring explicit mathematical explanations of complex
    processes (Ahmadi et al., 2022; Derbela and Nouiri, 2020; Di Salvo, 2022; Kim
    and Lee, 2022; Osman et al., 2022). This study compared the spatial mean, variability,
    and trends of GLDAS GWS data and BWDB GWL data from 2003 to 2019 to assess the
    performance of GLDAS GWS in Bangladesh. Subsequently, MLR and different machine
    learning algorithms, including regression trees, SVMs, GPRs, and ANN models, were
    employed to predict the spatial pattern of GWL using freely available data, including
    rainfall, temperature, elevation, GWS, variability in terrestrial water storage
    changes (VTWSC), population, and irrigation data. The intention was to predict
    GWL at any location and time with higher accuracy and reliability. This study
    is the first to model the relationship between in-situ GWL data and openly available
    data, providing an easy way to estimate GWL. The developed model holds great potential
    for assisting in the country''s sustainable management of groundwater resources.
    2. Study area Bangladesh, located near the mouth of the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 1),
    occupies a significant portion of the Bengal Delta formed by sediment deposition
    from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system (Allison et al., 2003; Kuehl
    et al., 2005; Mukherjee et al., 2009). The land is characterized by numerous rivers
    and relatively flat terrain, which accounts for about 80% of the total land area.
    Approximately 70.1% of the land is used for agriculture, forests cover 11.1%,
    and 18.8% serve other purposes (CIA, 2021). As of 2019, the country had a population
    of 163 million (UN DESA, 2019). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location of groundwater monitoring wells over
    the gridded climatic zone map of Bangladesh (Beck et al., 2018; Fahim et al.,
    2022). The map categorizes climatic zones using the Köppen-Geiger system, providing
    context for groundwater dynamics in diverse climate conditions. Bangladesh occupies
    the downstream portion of the GBM river system, which drains a total land area
    of 1.72 million km2. Only about 8% of the entire watershed is within Bangladesh''s
    territory (Ahmad et al., 2001; Chowdhury, 2010). Surface water infiltration from
    external sources plays a crucial role in recharging a part of the groundwater.
    Over the Pleistocene and Holocene periods, large rivers deposited sediments in
    the GBM delta, forming the deltaic and aquifer systems. The aquifers mainly consist
    of semi-consolidated to unconsolidated fluvial-deltaic sediments from the Miocene
    to the present. Among these, the shallowest aquifers suitable for groundwater
    extraction are the Holocene and Plio-Pleistocene Dupi Tila Sandstone formations.
    The average depth of the aquifers ranges from 30 to 130 m, and the primary water-bearing
    zone lies between 250 and 350 m. This zone predominantly comprises fine to very
    fine sand, occasionally interspersed with clay lenses and frequently interbedded
    with a silty clay layer (Chowdhury, 2010; Coleman, 1969; MPO, 1987; Uddin and
    Lundberg, 1998; UNDP, 1982). Bangladesh, situated along the Tropic of Cancer,
    experiences a humid tropical/subtropical climate characterized by high humidity,
    mild temperatures, and significant seasonal variations in rainfall. According
    to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Beck et al., 2018), the country can
    be classified into three distinct climate zones: tropical savannah, tropical monsoon,
    and temperate dry winter and hot summer (Fig. 1). The average annual rainfall
    ranges from 1500 mm in the west to nearly 4000 mm in the northeast, with an overall
    average of >2300 mm. The average temperature is relatively low during winter (18
    °C) and higher during summer (30 °C). Climate models project that by the end of
    the 21st century, Bangladesh''s average temperature will increase by 2.4 °C, and
    annual rainfall will see a 9.7% increase (Agrawala et al., 2003). 3. Methodology
    and materials 3.1. Data & sources The weekly groundwater level (GWL) data for
    the selected wells were collected from the Bangladesh Water Development Board
    (BWDB). GWL represents the depth of the water table beneath the land surface.
    BWDB has installed thousands of groundwater monitoring wells across the country.
    GWLs are physically measured weekly at these monitoring wells. This measurement
    captures the vertical distance between the ground and the point where the subsurface
    becomes saturated with water, providing a standardized and clear way to understand
    groundwater levels. In the context of modeling spatial groundwater levels in Bangladesh,
    referencing groundwater measurements to the land surface rather than sea elevation
    as the hydraulic head is grounded in the region''s unique hydrogeological characteristics
    and physio-climatic variables. While sea elevation is a common reference point
    in hydrogeological studies, it may not accurately capture the complexities of
    groundwater dynamics in a country with distinct topographical features and a specific
    climate. The variability in population density, rainfall patterns, temperature,
    irrigation practices, and elevation across the region necessitates a localized
    reference point for meaningful groundwater assessments. The GLDAS-2.0 daily product
    comprises 33 parameters (Rui et al., 2019). This study used GLDAS-2.0 Catchment
    Land Surface Model 3.6 data, which simulates shallow groundwater. The GLDAS Global
    Water Storage (GWS) daily data, with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, from
    2003 to 2020 (GLDAS 2.0), were downloaded from the GLDAS website. Selecting relevant
    and significant input variables is crucial in developing regression and machine
    learning models. Some input variables may be redundant or noisy or not influence
    the desired output (Maier and Dandy, 1998). This study considered GLDAS GWS data,
    elevation data, temperature data, rainfall data from the Asian Precipitation-Highly
    Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources
    (APHRODITE), population data from LandScan, irrigation data from FAO AQUASTAT,
    and VTWSC estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) by
    calculating the standard deviation of monthly terrestrial water storage changes
    (TWSC) data for the respective year (Han et al., 2005). Additional relevant information
    on the data used in the study can be found in Table 1. Table 1. Description of

    GWL Point Data Weekly 2003–2019 BWDB http://www.hydrology.bwdb.gov.bd/ GRACE was
    launched in March 2002 to estimate Earth''s gravity field variations (Tapley et
    al., 2004). By converting recorded gravity anomalies into changes in water column
    height, the GRACE twin satellites track monthly variations in total water storage
    (Ramillien et al., 2008; Syed et al., 2008). This study used the monthly mass
    grid developed by the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at
    Austin, based on RL05 spherical harmonic coefficients. APHRODITE provides a daily
    gridded precipitation and temperature dataset covering more than 50 years. Additionally,
    it offers elevation information. Many researchers have used APHRODITE climatic
    data as input parameters for modeling the water table, including precipitation
    alone (Daliakopoulos et al., 2005) and both precipitation and temperature (Coppola
    et al., 2005b; Ghose et al., 2010; Lallahem et al., 2005; Tsanis et al., 2008).
    LandScan offers the highest-resolution population distribution data available
    worldwide, with an average resolution of approximately 1 km (30\" × 30″). The
    LandScan data distribution models are customized to suit each country and region''s
    data conditions and geographic characteristics. The FAO AQUASTAT irrigated area
    (version 5) (Siebert et al., 2013) map depicts the area equipped for irrigation
    as a proportion of the total area of each cell of 10 × 10 km. This study used
    ArcGIS Desktop 10.8 and ‘R’ programming software for data processing and analysis
    (ESRI, 2020; MathWorks, 2021; R Core Team, 2022). 3.2. Methods The study rigorously
    followed a structured methodology, beginning with comprehensive data collection,
    extraction, and processing. It then split into two main components. Firstly, it
    assessed the effectiveness of GLDAS GWS data by generating yearly time series,
    analyzing trends, and comparing them with in-situ GWL. The second part involved
    developing and comparing different machine-learning models for GWL prediction.
    This included preparing inputs, model development, rigorous performance evaluation,
    and simulating mean GWL in areas lacking in-situ data. A visual representation
    of these processes can be seen in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (296KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart illustrating the two distinct
    phases of the study: 1) comparative analysis of in-situ groundwater level (GWL)
    and GLDAS global water storage (GWS) data, and 2) development and evaluation of
    machine learning models for GWL prediction. 3.2.1. Data processing The quality
    of BWDB GWL data was thoroughly examined, specifically focusing on the years 2003–2019
    for analysis. Each site''s data was organized into time series, histograms, and
    box plots to identify gaps, outliers, or irregularities. Samples with more than
    1% outliers or data that exhibited sudden shifts and unpredictable fluctuations
    were excluded. Ultimately, stations with a percentage of missing data of 10% or
    less were chosen, resulting in 844 monitoring wells with reliable data for further
    analysis. Cubic spline interpolation was employed to complete the groundwater
    hydrographs (Marsden, 1974; Peng-zhu et al., 2015). Various statistical methods,
    such as temporal interpolation with kriging (Rouhani and Wackernagel, 1990), an
    autoregressive-moving-average model with exogenous inputs (Bidwell, 2005), multi-level
    regression (Khorasani et al., 2016), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving
    average (Oikonomou et al., 2018), have been developed for imputing missing groundwater
    level data. Given the rapid shifts in GWL observed in Bangladesh within short
    time frames, accurate imputation of missing data requires addressing each segment
    of the series independently (Evans et al., 2020; Ruybal et al., 2019). Therefore,
    this study used the Cubic spline method to fill the gap. Fig. 1 illustrates the
    distribution of observation wells across Bangladesh, covering the country except
    for some hilly and forested areas in the southeast. We then converted the GWL
    well data into grids with a 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution, matching the GWS
    data. To achieve this, we averaged the GWL values from all wells within each grid
    cell (Fig. 7(c)). While other selected input data in all models could vary temporally,
    this study focused solely on their spatial mean values. To accommodate this, we
    employed meticulous processing techniques, including temporal averaging (except
    for elevation) and harmonization, to ensure compatibility between datasets with
    different temporal resolutions. The disparity in spatial resolution between global
    satellite data and ground observations posed a challenge for model development.
    This was addressed by implementing spatial averaging and interpolation techniques,
    which resampled all data to a consistent resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° (Fig. 3).
    This approach minimized the impact of resolution differences and enabled a more
    comprehensive understanding of the data, ultimately facilitating accurate model
    development. Since BWDB groundwater observation wells were not available for comparison
    and model development, only the grids with available GWL data were selected. Download

    and gridded input data: a) mean temperature, b) mean rainfall, c) population,
    d) irrigation, e) elevation, and f) variability in terrestrial water storage changes
    (VTWSC). Along with these, groundwater storage (GWS), as shown in Fig. 7(a), was
    used as input for model development. 3.2.2. Trend analysis Various parametric,
    nonparametric, and mixed approaches can be utilized to identify and quantify trends.
    Nonparametric approaches are commonly employed in climatic and hydrological research
    due to their robustness in handling missing and tied data, serial dependence,
    non-linearity, non-normality, and seasonality (Helsel et al., 2020). In this study,
    the nonparametric modified M-K test (Hamed, 2009) and Sen slope estimator were
    utilized. The Sen slope estimator is primarily used to measure changes over time
    per unit (Sen, 1968), while the modified M-K test assesses the significance of
    the change by eliminating the influence of autocorrelations (Hamed, 2009). 3.2.3.
    Modeling GWL 3.2.3.1. Linear regression Linear regression fits a linear model
    to the data by estimating the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors
    (Hastie et al., 2009). The equation for linear regression with multiple variables
    is as follows: (1) where Yi represents the ith observation of the dependent variable
    Y; x1,i, x2,i, … …., xk,i represent the ith observations of independent variables
    x1, x2 …, xk, respectively; β0, β1, β2 …. …., βk are fixed but unknown parameters;
    and εi is a random variable that is normally distributed. 3.2.3.2. Support vector
    machine (SVMregression Support Vector Machine Regression aims to find a hyperplane
    that maximizes the margin around the training data while allowing for a certain
    amount of error. The predicted value is obtained by evaluating a regression function.
    The formulation for SVM regression with multiple variables involves solving the
    following optimization problem (Smola and Schölkopf, 2004): (2) Subject to: .
    where and b are the parameters of the hyperplane, C is the regularization parameter,
    is the input feature vector, is the target value, and represents the error term.
    Linear SVM uses a linear kernel function and aims to find a hyperplane that best
    separates the data points. The quadratic SVM model employs a quadratic kernel
    function to capture nonlinear relationships between variables. Fine Gaussian SVM
    uses a Gaussian kernel function and is suitable for capturing intricate relationships.
    Medium Gaussian SVM employs a Gaussian kernel function with moderate complexity.
    Coarse Gaussian SVM uses a Gaussian kernel function with a larger scale for capturing
    broader relationships. 3.2.3.3. Gaussian process regression GPR uses a Gaussian
    process to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
    It assumes a prior distribution over functions and updates it based on the observed
    data. The general equation of GPR is given by (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006):
    (3) where, is the predicted target value for the new input point , is the vector
    of kernel evaluations between the new input point and the observed input points,
    K is the kernel matrix containing evaluations of the kernel function for all pairs
    of observed input points, represents the variance of the observation noise, is
    the identity matrix and is the vector of observed target values. This equation
    encapsulates the essence of GPR prediction, where the kernel evaluations and the
    covariance matrix of the observed data determine the mean and variance of the
    predicted value. GPR seeks to model the inherent distribution of the data and
    make predictions grounded in the relationships encoded within the kernel function.
    GPR offers various variants that cater to diverse data patterns: Rational Quadratic
    GPR model, leveraging a rational quadratic kernel function, captures both short
    and long-range dependencies. It excels in capturing intricate patterns within
    the groundwater data. Employing the squared exponential kernel, the Squared Exponential
    GPR variant is adept at modeling smooth functions, making it suitable for capturing
    trends in the data. Utilizing the Matern 5/2 kernel function, this model balances
    smoothness and flexibility, crucial for representing the complex groundwater level
    dynamics. The exponential GPR model captures trends in the data while accommodating
    inherent variability by leveraging the exponential kernel function. 3.2.3.4. Regression
    trees Regression Trees partition the feature space into regions and assign a constant
    value to each leaf node. The variations in tree construction include fine, medium,
    and coarse trees, which differ in their depth and complexity (Breiman, 2001).
    Fine trees have deeper nodes, allowing for more intricate decision boundaries.
    They can capture complex relationships but may also overfit the data if not regularized
    properly. In contrast, medium trees strike a balance between depth and simplicity.
    They capture moderately complex relationships and tend to generalize better than
    fine trees. The coarse trees are shallow and have fewer nodes. They capture simple
    relationships and are less prone to overfitting. Coarse trees may provide a high-level
    understanding of the data but may not capture fine-grained details. The choice
    of tree complexity depends on the complexity of the problem and the trade-off
    between interpretability and predictive performance (Krzywinski and Altman, 2017).
    3.2.3.5. Ensembled Regression Trees Ensembled Regression Trees combine multiple
    regression trees to make predictions. Two common types of ensembles are Bagged
    and Boosted ensembles. - Bagged Trees (Random Forests): Bagged trees, such as
    Random Forests, train individual trees on different bootstrap samples of the data.
    The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all trees. Random
    Forests reduce overfitting and improve generalization by combining multiple diverse
    trees (Altman and Krzywinski, 2017; Sutton, 2005). - Boosted Trees (Gradient Boosting):
    Boosted trees, like Gradient Boosting, train trees sequentially, with each tree
    correcting the mistakes of the previous trees. Each subsequent tree focuses on
    capturing the residual errors of the previous trees, leading to a refined prediction.
    Boosted ensembles effectively handle complex relationships and achieve high predictive
    accuracy (Sutton, 2005). 3.2.3.6. Artificial neural network ANN consists of nodes,
    also known as \"neurons,\" which serve as processing units within the network.
    Each neuron receives input, analyzes it, and produces an output signal after connecting
    with other neurons (Haykin, 1999). ANN is designed to mimic the functions of biological
    neurons artificially. Therefore, creating an ANN or ANN model involves five fundamental
    steps: (1) selecting influential inputs, (2) determining an appropriate ANN topology,
    (3) constructing the network, (4) training and validating the model, and (5) assessing
    the model''s performance. The flowchart in Fig. 4 illustrates the procedure for
    developing the ANN model for predicting GWL. The different phases of ANN are briefly
    discussed in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (434KB)

    sequential workflow of the artificial neural network (ANN) model, encompassing
    key stages such as input selection, architecture determination, model construction,
    training and validation, and performance assessment. This study employed a multilayer
    feedforward network (MLF) with a single hidden layer, as it has been commonly
    used in groundwater simulation and prediction due to its simplicity in construction
    (Hornik et al., 1989). The nodes in an MLF are typically arranged in layers, with
    one or multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. The prediction
    of the ANN model (Y1), which is GWL in this case, can be expressed as follows
    (Haykin, 1999): (4) where Bo denotes the output layer bias (which consists of
    a single neuron); Wk is the connection weight between the kth neuron in the hidden
    layer and the single neuron in the output layer. The connection weight between
    the input variable i (i = 1, m) and the neuron k of the hidden layer is designated
    as Wik. BHk is the bias at neuron k (k = 1, n) of the hidden layer. The transfer
    function is denoted by fT(θ), while Pi designates the input parameter. Once the
    ANN architecture has been selected, the network needs training. The purpose of
    training is to ensure that the ANN captures the essential properties or patterns
    of the input data. During the training process, the model''s weights and biases
    are calculated. The most commonly used training algorithm for feedforward ANN
    is backpropagation training (Hagan and Demuth, 2014; Hagan and Menhaj, 1994),
    a two-step algorithm. In the first step, the input data is forwarded through the
    network to calculate the outputs. Then, in the second step, a backward process
    is performed to adjust the weight vectors between the layers to minimize model
    error. Various weight-optimization strategies for training ANNs have been tested
    in this study (Table 3), and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was given priority
    due to its ability to achieve rapid convergence (Moré, 1978; William et al., 1989).

    determines how it responds to the complete input signal. The most commonly used
    activation functions are linear, hyperbolic tangent sigmoid, and logistic sigmoid
    (Dekker et al., 2001; Haykin, 1999; Maier and Dandy, 2000; Rumelhart et al., 1995).
    The final ANN model employed the most suitable function, considering the use of
    functions in both the hidden and output layers. The role of hidden-layer neurons
    is to establish connections between a network''s inputs and outputs. Insufficient
    hidden neurons can make convergence challenging during training. Conversely, if
    the network uses too many hidden neurons, it may lose its generalization capability
    (Govindaraju, 2000). Some researchers have demonstrated that optimization algorithms
    can optimize hidden neurons (Castillo et al., 2000; Gerken et al., 2006; Jones,
    1993). However, in this study, the commonly used trial-and-error method was employed.
    3.2.4. Model''s performance assessment A set of conventional statistical indicators
    was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed models. These indicators
    included the multiple correlation coefficient (R), mean square error (MSE), and
    mean absolute errors (MAE) were used to assess their performance. For that, 80%
    of the data was allocated for training, and 20% of the data was used for validation
    in each method. 4. Results 4.1. Comparison between GWL and GWS data The GWS data
    for Bangladesh was compared with GWL in replicating spatial mean, variability,
    and trends. Fig. 5 presents a scatter plot of the mean GWS and GWL at 183 grids
    across Bangladesh. It reveals a weak, negative, and linear relationship between
    the mean GWS and GWL, with an R-value of 0.15. However, the correlation is not
    statistically significant, indicating that the GLDAS GWS data is not comparable
    to the BWDB GWL data in Bangladesh. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    across 183 grids covering Bangladesh. The analysis indicates a weak, negative,
    and linear correlation between mean GWS and GWL, with an R-value of 0.15. The
    spatial distribution of mean GWS is presented in Fig. 6(a). The mean GWS in Bangladesh
    ranged from 0.63 m to 1.74 m. The highest GWS, ranging from 1.21 to 1.74 m, was
    found in the country''s northeastern region. Higher values were observed in the
    central east to southeast areas, which fall within the tropical monsoon zone (Am;
    Fig. 1). The lowest values, ranging from 0.63 to 0.72 m, were observed in the
    northwest to central west areas, predominantly in the temperate, dry winter, hot
    summer and tropical savannah zones, with a southeastern strip in the tropical
    monsoon zone. Fig. 6(c) illustrates that the average GWL ranged from 0.92 to 26.35
    m below ground level. The central and northern parts exhibited the lowest GWL,
    measuring between 11.40 and 26.35 m below ground level. In contrast, the southern
    region and parts of the northeast and far northwest had the highest GWL levels
    (0.92–2.99 m). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    GWL, respectively. The rate of change is represented using different colors on
    the maps, with significant changes at the 95% confidence level also indicated
    in the figure. The results revealed a decreasing trend in GWS across the country,
    with the highest decreases observed in the northwest region (−0.013 to −0.017
    m/year) and the lowest in the northeast and south (0 to −0.002 m/year). Fig. 7(d)
    also depicts a decline in GWL throughout the country, with the highest rate of
    decline observed in the central and northwest parts (−0.120 to −0.272 m/year).
    Some areas throughout the country, particularly in the south, showed a slight
    increase. To calculate the monthly variability in GWS and GWL for each year, GWS
    and GWL variability time series were generated at each location from 2003 to 2019.
    These series were used to determine the average GWS and GWL variability and their
    changes over time at each grid, aiming to depict the seasonal and yearly fluctuations
    in GWS and GWL. The analysis revealed that GWS variability was higher in the southeast
    and northwest regions and lower in the northeast and southwest regions. Conversely,
    GWL variability exhibited its highest values in the northwest and north-central
    areas (Fig. 7(a)), where GWL fluctuations reached up to 3.95 m. The trends in
    GWS variability displayed increased variability in the south and decreased variability
    in the northern part of the country. However, the trends in GWL variability did
    not exhibit a distinct spatial pattern (Fig. 7(b)). The central areas of the country
    experienced the highest increase in GWL variability, although a few localized
    areas showed lower variability than others. The wide range in GWL variability
    suggests significant deviations from the mean GWL throughout most of Bangladesh.
    4.2. Evaluation of different models In the comprehensive evaluation process aimed
    at predicting groundwater levels in Bangladesh, a meticulous analysis was carried
    out using an array of models. The aim was to shed light on the distinct characteristics
    inherent in each algorithm. Fig. 8 shows the scatter plots of the observed and
    predicted GWL using different models. Table 2 shows the validation matrices of
    these models ordered based on their performance. The models in the table are ordered
    according to their prediction accuracy, while similar models are grouped together
    in Fig. 8 for easy comparison. Download : Download high-res image (833KB) Download

    Quadratic Gaussian process regression (GPR), (m) Squared Exponential Gaussian
    process regression (GPR), (n) Matern 5/2 GPR, (o) Exponential GPR, and (p) Artificial
    neural network (ANN). The MLR, a fundamental approach in predictive modeling,
    fitted a linear model to the data by estimating coefficients that minimized the
    sum of squared errors (Hastie et al., 2009). This model yielded an R-value of
    0.55, with a corresponding MSE of 2.81 and MAE of 1.25, providing a baseline performance.
    The Fine Trees model emerged as a promising contender. Configured with a minimum
    leaf size of 4, this model exhibited improved predictive capabilities. Notably,
    it achieved an R-value of 0.74, indicating a reasonably strong linear relationship
    between the predicted and actual groundwater levels. The corresponding MSE of
    1.65 and MAE of 0.98 further reinforced its accuracy. Fine Trees capture complex
    relationships in the data through a more intricate decision boundary structure.
    The Medium Trees model demonstrated a balance between depth and simplicity. With
    a preset that included a minimum leaf size of 12, it captured moderately complex
    relationships. This model exhibited an R-value of 0.46, an MSE of 2.89, and an
    MAE of 1.28. It strikes a balance between capturing complex patterns and avoiding
    overfitting. Similarly, the Coarse Trees model, configured with a minimum leaf
    size of 36, provided a shallower tree structure. While it captured simpler relationships,
    it was less prone to overfitting. This model presented an R of 0.57, an MSE of
    2.47, and an MAE of 1.23. Coarse Trees offer a high-level understanding of the
    data while avoiding intricate details. Moving to ensemble methods, the Boosted
    Trees (Gradient Boosting) model stood out, featuring a minimum leaf size of 8,
    30 learners, and a learning rate of 0.1. An R-value of 0.76 suggested a substantial
    correlation between predicted and actual values, while the impressively low MSE
    of 0.87 and MAE of 0.78 underscored its ability to capture the nuances of the
    groundwater level data. Boosted Trees sequentially refine predictions by focusing
    on capturing residual errors. The Bagged Trees model was equally impressive, with
    a configuration featuring a minimum leaf size of 8 and 30 learners. This model
    showcased a remarkable R-value of 0.84, indicating robust predictive capability.
    Despite its higher MSE of 1.05, the equally low MAE of 0.85 emphasized its consistency
    in minimizing prediction errors. Bagged Trees reduce overfitting by combining
    diverse trees. In SVM, the Linear SVM model registered an R of 0.51, MSE of 2.72,
    and MAE of 1.21. SVMs aim to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin around
    the training data while allowing for a certain amount of error. The Quadratic
    SVM model, however, exhibited diminished performance with an R of 0.20, MSE of
    4.34, and MAE of 1.53. Fine Gaussian SVM showcases potential with an R of 0.87,
    MSE of 0.88, and MAE of 0.71, while Medium Gaussian SVM delivers an R of 0.79,
    MSE of 1.38, and MAE of 0.78. The Rational Quadratic GPR model presented an R
    of 0.71, MSE of 1.83, and MAE of 0.82 among the GPR methods. Similarly, the Squared
    Exponential GPR model showed comparable results with an R of 0.71, MSE of 1.83,
    and MAE of 0.82. The Matern 5/2 GPR model showcased an R of 0.79, MSE of 1.35,
    and MAE of 0.79. The Exponential GPR model impressed with an R of 0.84, MSE of
    1.08, and MAE of 0.71. The ANN model was configured as a feed-forward backpropagation
    network with a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function. This model performed
    best with an exceptional R-value of 0.96. Its remarkably low MSE of 0.62 and an
    equally impressive MAE of 0.67 firmly established its dominance in capturing complex
    relationships within the groundwater data. The realization of these outcomes necessitated
    a methodical exploration encompassing diverse configurations of ANN hyperparameters
    and training functions. A comprehensive discourse on this meticulous process is
    presented in Subsection 4.3, wherein the nuances of hyperparameter tuning are
    expounded upon. In essence, this extensive evaluation''s outcome underscores each
    model''s nuanced strengths and limitations. In the analysis, it has been found
    that the ANN is the most effective in predicting the groundwater level in Bangladesh.
    For that, the ANN model has been used for further analysis. 4.3. Prediction using
    the ANN model Different combinations of networks, training, transfer, adaptation
    learning, and performance functions were used to train the ANN model to identify
    the optimal hyperparameter combination. Various numbers of hidden neurons were
    also tested for each combination. The outcome obtained from different training
    functions is presented in Table 3, while the other functions and network types
    are listed in Table 4. The Levenberg-Marquardt training function yielded the best
    results (R = 0.95, MSE = 0.64) according to Table 3, followed by Bayesian Regularization
    (R = 0.93, MSE = 0.71), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (R = 0.92, MSE = 0.74), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
    Quasi-Newton (R = 0.91, MSE = 0.75), and other functions. The most favorable outcome
    was achieved by combining the feedforward backpropagation network, Levenberg-Marquardt
    training function, gradient descent with momentum adaption learning function,
    hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function, and mean squared error (MSE) performance

    The ANN modeling process was carried out using MATLAB, with 70% of the data allocated
    for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This proportion was chosen
    after testing different ratios to determine the performance of the ANN model.
    The relative importance of different input variables was analyzed by examining
    the weights assigned to them in the trained ANN. Variables with larger weights
    were deemed more influential in shaping the network''s predictions. Then, the
    delta method was applied to estimate the standard errors associated with these
    variable weights, providing a measure of their uncertainty. This allowed for a
    more comprehensive understanding of the importance of each variable. Importance
    indices were then computed based on the weights and standard errors, quantitatively
    comparing variable importance. This facilitated the identification of key variables
    that had the most significant impact on the ANN''s performance. Finally, the variables
    were ranked based on their relative importance, providing insights into their
    hierarchical order of influence (GuyonIsabelle, ElisseeffAndré, 2003; Hinton and
    Salakhutdinov, 2006). Fig. 9 shows the relative importance of input variables.
    Notably, the results reveal that the population exerts the strongest influence
    on the ANN training, followed by rainfall, VTWSC, elevation, GWS, temperature,
    and irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (267KB) Download : Download

    wells are available. In certain parts of Bangladesh, no groundwater observation
    wells are established by the BWDB. However, even though the developed ANN model
    was validated and tested using only 30% of the available data (as shown in Fig.
    8), it was still employed to predict GWL in those areas to showcase its utility
    (Fig. 10(c)). 5. Discussion The main objective of this study has been to address
    the challenge of reliably monitoring groundwater levels using easily obtainable
    data. The study identified a suitable data source for regular groundwater observations
    and developed a model capable of accurately predicting groundwater levels using
    freely available data. The comparison between GWS and GWL data provides essential
    insights into the reliability and suitability of GWS data for groundwater monitoring
    in Bangladesh. 5.1. Spatial variability and climatic influences The spatial analysis
    of mean GWS in Fig. 6(a) illustrates substantial variability across the country.
    The highest GWS values were observed in the northeastern region, which coincides
    with the tropical monsoon zone characterized by higher precipitation. These findings
    align with the expectation that areas experiencing higher rainfall tend to exhibit
    greater groundwater storage. Concurrently, the lower GWS values in the northwest
    and central west regions, mainly located in temperate and dry climatic zones,
    emphasize the impact of climatic conditions on groundwater storage. This suggests
    that GWS data can capture variations in groundwater storage influenced by regional
    climate characteristics. Also, this aligns with the findings of many existing
    studies (Fahim et al., 2022; Hoque et al., 2007; Islam and Mostafa, 2021; Shahid
    and Hazarika, 2010b). 5.2. Correlation analysis between GWS and GWL The correlation
    between GWS and GWL (Fig. 5) exhibited a weak, negative, and linear relationship
    (R-value of 0.15), indicating that while GWS data provide some insight into GWL
    trends, other factors contribute significantly to GWL fluctuations. Similar weak
    correlation with GLDAS derived GWS has been found in six river basins of Northern
    China (Yin et al., 2017). This underscores the need for incorporating additional
    variables, such as rainfall and population, into the modeling process. 5.3. Changing
    groundwater dynamics: trends and concerns The trends in GWS and GWL (Fig. 6(b)
    and (d)) reveal crucial insights into the changing groundwater dynamics over the
    study period. The decreasing trend in GWS across the country, particularly pronounced
    in the northwest, emphasizes the ongoing decline in groundwater storage. This
    aligns with the concerns regarding the over-extraction of groundwater resources
    in Bangladesh (Bhattacharjee et al., 2019; Hoque et al., 2007; Islam et al., 2017;
    Shahid and Hazarika, 2010b). The decline in GWL, evident across the central and
    northwest regions, further corroborates the impact of excessive extraction on
    the groundwater table. Notably, the slight increase in GWL observed in some areas,
    particularly in the south, could be attributed to changes in land use or recharge
    mechanisms. The analysis of variability (Fig. 8) highlights the intricate seasonal
    and yearly fluctuations in GWS and GWL. Higher GWS variability in the southeast
    and northwest regions might be attributed to regional variations in precipitation
    patterns. The substantial variability in GWL observed in the northwest and north-central
    regions signifies the dynamic nature of groundwater responses to anthropogenic
    and climatic factors. While GWS data alone are insufficient to fully characterize
    the spatial variability and trends of groundwater in Bangladesh, their utilization
    in conjunction with other relevant variables, such as population and rainfall,
    could enhance the accuracy of groundwater monitoring models. Integrating remote
    sensing data, such as GWS, with ground-based observations presents a valuable
    approach to comprehensively understanding groundwater dynamics in data-scarce
    regions like Bangladesh. This means relying solely on GWS data for regular groundwater
    monitoring would be inadequate. Therefore, it becomes more viable and necessary
    to model GWL as an alternative approach. 5.4. Evaluating predictive models: strengths
    and optimal choices The thorough evaluation of diverse predictive models for groundwater
    level prediction in Bangladesh reveals distinctive strengths and limitations for
    each approach. The baseline model, MLR, established a fundamental linear relationship
    with limited accuracy. Fine Trees demonstrated improved performance, capturing
    nonlinear relationships effectively. Medium Trees balanced complexity and overfitting
    avoidance, while Coarse Trees offered a simplified overview. Ensemble methods
    like Boosted Trees and Bagged Trees showcased robust predictive capabilities by
    combining diverse learners. SVMs demonstrated varying success, with Linear SVM
    showing potential for linear relationships and Quadratic SVM exhibiting limitations.
    Among GPR models, Exponential GPR excelled in capturing complex relationships.
    However, The ANN model was the most efficient in groundwater level prediction.
    Its exceptional R-value and low MSE and MAE values underscore its proficiency
    in capturing intricate and nonlinear relationships within groundwater data. The
    evaluation highlighted the balance between model complexity and performance. Notably,
    the success of Fine Trees and the ANN model emphasizes the significance of intricate
    structures for intricate data relationships, positioning the ANN as the optimal
    choice for accurate groundwater level prediction in Bangladesh. Numerous studies
    have also shown that ANN can accurately estimate GWL (Ebrahimi and Rajaee, 2017;
    Gholami et al., 2015; Kouziokas et al., 2018; Mohanty et al., 2015; Mukherjee
    and Ramachandran, 2018; Wunsch et al., 2018). Rajaee et al. (2019) reviewed many
    studies on modeling GWL using ANN and demonstrated its advantages over other methods.
    Predicting groundwater levels using the ANN model involved a meticulous exploration
    of diverse hyperparameter combinations. This search for optimal configurations
    encompassed various aspects like network types, training, transfer, adaptation
    learning, and performance functions. Among these, the Levenberg-Marquardt training
    function emerged as the most effective, producing a high R-value of 0.95 and a
    low MSE of 0.64. This aligns with previous research highlighting the efficiency
    of Levenberg-Marquardt in training neural networks. Additionally, the ANN model''s
    optimization involved a feedforward backpropagation architecture with hyperbolic
    tangent sigmoid transfer functions, leading to superior performance. This further
    reinforces the effectiveness of such combinations in capturing complex relationships
    within groundwater data. The model''s performance, demonstrated in Fig. 9, affirms
    its accuracy in predicting groundwater levels. Consistently high R-values across
    training, validation, and testing phases highlight the model''s ability to generalize
    effectively beyond the training data, a crucial aspect in predictive modeling.
    5.5. Hierarchy of influence: understanding input variables The relative importance
    of input variables (Fig. 9) provided insights into the hierarchy of influence.
    Population emerged as a significant driver, reinforcing its role in shaping groundwater
    dynamics. This is consistent with the notion that population density can increase
    groundwater demand. Rainfall, VTWSC, elevation, GWS, temperature, and irrigation
    also demonstrated notable contributions. 5.6. Aligning model results with actual
    observations The results obtained from the model aligned well with the actual
    mean GWL values observed (Fig. 10). However, it is worth noting that significantly
    higher GWL values were observed in the hilly southeastern regions, particularly
    in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This disparity can be attributed to the fact that
    GWL represents the groundwater depth below the ground surface, and in hilly areas,
    the natural elevation is higher than the persistent groundwater level. Previous
    studies have also reported significantly lower GWL values in hilly regions (Shahid,
    2010). 5.7. Future research directions: toward comprehensive groundwater understanding
    Integrating more geohydrological, climatic and demographic factors into predictive
    models and incorporating temporal dimension to the data would further enhance
    their accuracy and applicability. The need for a comprehensive understanding of
    groundwater dynamics in data-scarce regions like Bangladesh is emphasized, advocating
    for the integration of remote sensing data, such as GWS, with ground-based observations.
    The discussion urges researchers to move beyond sole reliance on GWS data for
    regular groundwater monitoring, highlighting the necessity of modeling groundwater
    levels as an alternative and complementary approach. 6. Conclusion This study
    developed a method for easy and regular monitoring of groundwater status in Bangladesh.
    Initially, spatial mean, variability, and GLDAS GWS and BWDB GWL data trends for
    2003–2019 were calculated and compared. Different models were then established
    using freely available rainfall, temperature, elevation, GWS, VTWSC, population,
    and irrigation data to predict GWL data for any location. The key findings of
    the study can be summarized as follows. (1) Sole reliance on GLDAS GWS data for
    groundwater monitoring in Bangladesh is insufficient due to the limited correlations
    between its characteristics and in-situ GWL data. (2) Among the models evaluated,
    the ANN model stands out with remarkable prowess in capturing intricate and nonlinear
    relationships intrinsic to groundwater data, making it a paramount choice for
    accurately modeling complex systems. Therefore, ANN is recommended for predicting
    GWL with greater precision. These findings will be valuable for practitioners
    involved in the frequent monitoring of GWL levels, enabling them to achieve sustainable
    and balanced groundwater management and contribute to the conservation and regeneration
    of Bangladesh''s groundwater system. The ANN technique can be a cost-effective
    option for GWL simulation and prediction, particularly when professional expertise
    and time are limited while reliable field data are still available. The methodology
    presented in this study can be easily applied to other regions worldwide, irrespective
    of their hydrogeological conditions. It is important to highlight that this study
    primarily focused on the spatial analysis of average parameter values rather than
    incorporating temporal aspects into the model development. The lack of consistency
    in the temporal resolution and timeframe of the available data influenced this
    decision. Groundwater level data in Bangladesh are collected manually, introducing
    significant uncertainty and potential human errors. While thorough statistical
    assessments of data quality have been conducted, and missing values have been
    imputed using the spline method, alternative techniques like spatial autocorrelation
    and multiple imputation by chained equations could offer even greater robustness.

    for agriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, which makes
    a case for the intensive use of technology to optimize the use of water, reduce
    the consumption of energy and improve the quality of crops. While the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and other associated technologies are the natural choice for smart
    water management applications, their appropriateness is still to be proven in
    real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots. Also, IoT-based application
    development platforms should be generic enough to be adapted to different crops,
    climates, and countries. The SWAMP project develops IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. In this paper, we present the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots
    and the scenario-based development process adopted in the project. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bilbao, Spain SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture
    is by far the biggest consumer amounting to 70% of freshwater [7]. The leading
    causes of water wastage are leakages in distribution and irrigation systems, as
    well as, the field application methods, which result in wastage and the cultivation
    of crops. The most common irrigation technique, surface irrigation, is also the
    least precise one, which wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting areas
    where no plants can benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can
    use water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and
    over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by underirrigation,
    farmers feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is
    challenged but also water is wasted. Therefore, technology should be developed
    and deployed for sensing the level of water needed by the plantation and for flowing
    the water in the proper amount to places where and when it is needed. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) [1] and other related technologies can be used for that purpose,
    but it faces several challenges. Firstly, Software Development for IoT-based smart
    applications is today not automatized and demands much effort. Secondly, advanced
    platforms are needed, that can automate part of the process and integrate different
    technologies and components for dealing with a multitude of requirements. Thirdly,
    the integration of heterogeneous and advanced sensors, particularly flying sensors
    (i.e., drones), may provide precision in the water supply for irrigation in agriculture.
    Fourthly, the use of a Software Platform together with different technologies
    such as IoT, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing [3] and drones,
    for the deployment of pilot applications for smart water management. Fifthly,
    new business models for using IoT in smart water management settings are necessary.
    Moreover, finally, components must be interoperable, flexible and adaptable to
    be replicable to different locations, crops, and contexts. The primary objective
    of the SWAMP1 project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches for smart
    water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil.
    Also, we aim at improving precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of
    the condition of the crop, by monitoring the field based on crop status (size,
    growing phase) and environment (e.g., weather forecast) and to adjust the irrigation
    prescription map accordingly. The smart water management pilots aim at guaranteeing
    that technological components are flexible enough to adapt to different contexts
    and to be replicable in different locations and settings. The same underlying
    SWAMP platform can be customized to different pilots considering different countries,
    climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP layered architecture considers three types
    of services to ensure its replication and adaptability to different crops and
    locations. Entirely replicable services deal with IoT services, virtual entities
    and storage services, and data analytics and machine learning, respectively. Fully
    customizable services deal with water data management issues that specialize generic
    analytic services into particular techniques for different types of irrigation
    and water distribution. Those services may require being customized whenever a
    new pilot is designed, developed and deployed. Finally, application specific services
    require higher development effort since they serve particular farms. The architecture
    may be implemented in a range of deployment configurations involving the use of
    smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located
    on the farm premises and possibly mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g.,
    drones or in the central pivot irrigation mechanisms). In this paper, we present
    the SWAMP view of water management, the SWAMP architecture, the four SWAMP pilots
    and a scenario-oriented development process that consider both the crop needs
    and technological solutions. In the remainder of this paper, section II introduces
    concepts and related work. Section III introduces SWAMP concepts and methodology,
    while section IV presents the four pilots. Section V presents scenarios for deploying
    the pilots, and finally, section VI draws conclusions and future work. SECTION
    II. Iot In Precision Irrigation For Agriculture The Internet of Things is expected
    to have a decisive influence in the automation of smart water management applications.
    However, the development of IoT-enabled applications still takes tremendous efforts
    due to the lack of proper tools [8]. This scenario opens new opportunities and
    challenges in the specification, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of
    software development platforms for smart water management. The SWAMP project is
    being built upon existing efforts, generic platforms, architectures and research
    results [13]. The IoT-A project developed the IoT Reference Architecture for the
    generation of compliant IoT concrete architectures, focusing on using the current
    state of the art, rather than applying a clean slate approach [2]. FIWARE evolved
    from an EU-funded initiative for cloud services and now includes a platform with
    a set of Generic Enablers for developing smart applications [12], such as in the
    precision irrigation domain for agriculture [10]. When it comes to providing advanced
    features to the management of natural resources, such as water, there are some
    isolated initiatives not necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.
    For example, the FIGARO project aims at increasing water productivity and improving
    irrigation practices through the development of a precision irrigation management
    platform, but not directly involving IoT [6]. Also, Popović et al. [11] present
    a case study of the specially designed and currently limited IoTenabled platform
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.
    Agri-IoT [9] is a theoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and realtime
    processing for smart farming that shares some similarities with SWAMP. However,
    so far no real deployments have been reported, making it difficult to compare
    with SWAMP. In the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for
    IoT combined with cloud-based services and big data analytics. Now, the time has
    come to conduct experiments in real settings. In Europe, there is a current concern
    to understand the challenges and compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale pilots
    for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of those large-scale
    pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions that might
    be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops and meat
    & vegetable supply chain [5]. Also, the European project IoF2020 aims at fostering
    the adoption of IoT in large-scale pilots in the farming and food domain2. Current
    existing solutions are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences.
    They are either too generic or too specific and do not explicitly address easy
    system development and deployment for facilitating replicability of scenarios
    and streamlining the deployment of new pilots. This is where SWAMP comes to play.
    SECTION III. Concept and Methodology The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision
    smart irrigation system concept for agriculture depicted in Fig. 1. The fundamental
    idea is to enable optimizations of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption
    based on a holistic analysis that collects information from all aspects of the
    system including even the natural water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related
    to growing particular plants. It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees
    the availability of water in situations where water supply is limited and also
    prevents over-and under-irrigation. Fig. 1. Precision irrigation based on smart
    water management Show All As depicted in Fig. 1 we identify three broad phases
    in a water management system for agriculture: W1: Water reserve: water reserves
    coming from different sources such as rivers, lakes, dams, and aquifers, which
    follow the natural water cycle. W2: Water distribution: water is transported from
    W1 to the final usage place (W3) through a network of canals, pipes, pumps, valves,
    and gates. Water distribution may assume different configurations depending on
    the region or country. In some places, water resources are carefully used and
    controlled by a central authority. W3: Water consumption: in agriculture, one
    of the critical uses of water is irrigation, which can be performed by different
    techniques. Irrigation (W3) is the principal objective of the SWAMP project. The
    SWAMP platform provides mechanisms for data acquisition from sensors, making decisions
    using a variety of different techniques and changing system behavior by sending
    commands to both automatic and human actuators. For Water Consumption (W3) SWAMP
    will provide real-time responses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions change.
    On the other hand, as changes in water distribution are performed in a different
    timescale, the management loop for W2 will be longer. W2 and W3 management systems
    are integrated, as water usage triggers water distribution. The SWAMP Architecture
    is divided into five layers, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. SWAMP Architecture
    Show All Layer 1: IoT Services: A variety of sensor and actuator technologies
    to acquire soil (e.g., moisture and temperature), plant (e.g., vegetation index,
    canopy temperature) and weather (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity,
    precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and direction) will be tested during
    the project. Layer 2: Virtual Entity and Data Storage: IoT Service descriptions
    are annotated with contextual metadata about the physical environment to create
    Virtual Entity (VE) representations of physical entities. Distributed databases
    composed of cloud and fog nodes work together for dealing with a massive amount
    of data coming from sensors and make them available to the upper layers. Layer
    3: Data Analytics: provides different components for context-aware management
    supported by cloud-based big data analytics techniques. SWAMP will utilize existing
    models and algorithms to realize the Layer 3, which may vary for different crops
    and pilots. Layer 4: Water Data Management: builds application related middleware
    management services on top of the generic data processing services provided by
    Layer 3. This layer decouples the irrigation-related business rules from applications
    providing an API for Layer 5 with a variety of algorithms, models, and mechanisms
    for facilitating and streamlining the development and deployment of new pilots.
    Layer 5: Water Application Services: A multitude of data that is sensed, acquired,
    stored, and processed is transformed into services that make sense to farmers.
    SWAMP initially will consider two types of water application services, water distribution
    services, and water usage services (i.e., irrigation). A fundamental idea in SWAMP
    is to facilitate the replication of water management systems built on top of its
    platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment. Different layers of the architecture
    have components that are more generic and thus less difficult to be ported to
    other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific and thus require new
    development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. When it comes to the generality/specificity
    scale, the SWAMP architecture provides three categories of components: a) Fully
    Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 of the architecture are generic enough
    to allow them to be replicable in different settings. Sensors, actuators and associated
    IoT Services vary according to the specific application domain; b) Fully Customizable
    Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and
    therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques
    and models of water distribution and irrigation. Those services may require being
    customized for every new pilot; c) Application Specific Services: Services in
    Layer 5 address particularities of pilots. Given that parameters vary considerably
    for different countries, regulations, climate conditions, crops and soils, those
    services usually require more effort to be customized. SECTION IV. Swamp Pilots
    A. Pilot: Smart Water Distribution (Italy - CBEC) The Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia
    Centrale (CBEC) is a reclamation consortium of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern
    Italy, responsible for the irrigation and water drainage of an area of nearly
    3,130 km2 where most water required for irrigation is withdrawn from the Po river
    (Fig. 3). The water is distributed to the farms by an intricate irrigation infrastructure
    composed of more than 3580 km of canals, more than 200 small streams, six draining
    plants, and 72 pump stations with the capacity of 416 cubic meters per second.
    Fig. 3. Water distribution management pilot: open earth canal (left), manual operation
    (center) and water intake (right) Show All The supply and irrigation network consists
    of open channels on earth. Relevant widths characterize the main canals and their
    filling for the irrigation season involves the use of substantial water volumes
    that are not always recoverable for irrigation purposes. Water losses are due
    to evaporation and infiltration through canal banks and bottom, as well as to
    the management of the irrigation network that requires the filing of long canals
    stretches and several minor streams to accommodate farmer needs. The irrigation
    network also acts as drainage network for the cultivated areas. The SWAMP project
    aims at enhancing the overall system efficiency by acting at farmers and irrigation
    consortium levels. At the farmer level, SWAMP provides a better estimation of
    water needs regarding both amounts of water and time of delivery. This precise
    estimation can be achieved by the implementation of the IoT infrastructure that
    enables the integration of groundbased information with the weather forecast.
    At the consortium level, the management of the irrigation network can benefit
    from the optimization of multiple water requests ensured by the technological
    platform. The platform collects water needs adjusting the operational management
    of canals by merging detailed information of water needs, weather forecasts, and
    multiple requirements from farmers served by the same irrigation infrastructure.
    In particular, the SWAMP project enables the monitoring, automation, and remote
    control of the major hydraulic infrastructures, through which CBEC manages the
    water distribution within the irrigation district. The renovation of the hydraulic
    infrastructures together with the implementation of the IoT platform and data
    analytics scheme is expected to enable a consistent enhancement of the water distribution
    management that will persist after the project life. B. Pilot: Smart precision
    irrigation (Spain - Intercrop) This pilot is located in Cartagena, Spain, in the
    premises of Intercrop Iberica and addresses several challenges of smart irrigation
    and water management of geographically distributed fields, aiming at demonstrating
    the use of IoT sensor platforms and drones to achieve increased crop yield with
    optimal water usage with minimum labor effort. Even though Cartagena is located
    on the coast, that is a dry area with a short rain season with intense rains in
    just a few days. A considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant,
    what contributes to make it a scarce and expensive good. Farms are distributed
    over areas of roughly 30 km radius in intensive cropping area. Pilot site is shown
    in Fig. 4. The immediate closeness of the control fields gives ideal circumstances
    to verify the effectiveness of the deployed methods. There are three growth periods
    during the project giving an opportunity to do iterative piloting and compare
    the results of different iterations. Fig. 4. Intercrop irrigation pilot site.
    In the right, the arrow shows the precise location of the pilot site Show All
    Growing period starts in early September and finishes by late April. Crops are
    from different ranges such as lettuce, endive, spinach, herbs, and bay leaf. These
    farms are irrigated separately through their proper reservoirs and irrigation
    systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods, we selected the pilot
    site from the same area with control field that is using traditional irrigation
    and monitoring methods. Irrigation system on the pilot field is managed using
    solenoid valves, and total water consumption can be monitored via water meters.
    Facilities used in piloting are a local weather station, online weather services,
    long life smart soil sensors, drone gateway, and real-time cloud data analysis.
    C. Pilot: Variable Rate Irrigation (Brazil) The MATOPIBA region encompasses the
    Brazilian states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), Piauí (PI) and Bahia (BA),
    and is one of the most critical irrigated agricultural frontier in the country,
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Irrigation is mostly performed
    by thousands of center pivots, each one with an average size of 100 ha. The municipality
    of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (Fig. 5), the location for the center pivot pilot, is
    considered the capital of Brazilian agribusiness. Fig. 5. Center-pivot irrigation
    pilot: location of the pilot site (left) and center pivot irrigation for soybean
    crop (right) Show All The soybean production reached about 5.5 million tons in
    2016. Despite such production, the farmers estimated 40% crop losses due to the
    2015/16 season drought. The production from many properties was only 30 sacks
    per hectare, while an average of 58 sacks was expected. With irrigation and investments
    in soil fertility, some producers expect that this number can reach 80 sacks.
    Although irrigation is an alternative, its expansion depends on technologies that
    improve operating costs. For example, in 2015/16 the government imposed double
    charges to the energy used in irrigation, which costs seven sacks per hectare
    against three and a half sacks with a typical energy charging. The main MATOPIBA
    pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable
    Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production. However, alternate
    crops like corn and cotton are also usual, including during the same season. Conventional
    center pivot irrigation systems help to provide a reliable supply of water, increase
    yields, and provide double cropping potential. The proposed smart irrigation will
    help the crop in the same way while making rational use of water and energy. D.
    Pilot: Precision Drop Irrigation (Brazil - Guaspari) One of the significant innovations
    of winemaking in State of São Paulo, Brazil, is occurring in the municipality
    of Espírito Santo do Pinhal in the Guaspari Winery. It is the transfer of wine
    grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August), when the thermal amplitude,
    insolation, and absence of rainfall are better for harvesting, similar to the
    great wine regions of the world. The different terroirs that compose the vineyard
    are divided into plots, which are harvested separately. In that growing area,
    altitude ranges between 1,000 m and 1,300 m; nights are cold and optimal sunshine
    during the day provides an air temperature range between 10°C and 12°C at harvesting
    time, similar to that of large European regions. The soil is developed from granite
    rock, with good drainage, which is suitable for grapes destined to produce high-quality
    wines. The application of water by an irrigation system depends on the crop, weather,
    and soil conditions. Even with the availability of several criteria and procedures
    for the performance of irrigation management, the technique has a low adoption
    rate by the farmers. Occasionally irrigation is based on only the experience of
    the grower, on the visualization of the wet soil surface or even on the perception
    of visual symptoms of plant water deficit, which, when identified late, can affect
    yield and product quality. The lack of knowledge about irrigation management procedures
    can lead to the failure of this water application practice, even if there is a
    system designed for a specific cropping area. Guaspari Winery uses drip irrigation
    in its vineyards, with a single hose and emitters spaced at 0.5 m, and measured
    the flow of 1.9 L h-1. The experimental area has 1.1 ha and is shown in Fig. 6.
    The objectives of the Guaspari Winery Pilot are: a) to perform automatic measuring
    of soil water content at different soil depths and in several vineyards inside
    the winery s growing area; b) to store data in the cloud about soil water content
    be jointly processed with weather and crop information; c) To provide quick and
    accurate irrigation management information. Fig. 6. Guaspari Winery: Vineyard
    and pilot location (right) Show All SECTION V. Swamp Scenarios The SWAMP Platform
    is being built on existing and new concepts and technologies, implementing the
    SWAMP vision (Fig. 1) through the SWAMP Architecture (Fig. 2), which may be flexible
    enough to deal with the needs of four different IoT pilots for smart water management
    in precision irrigation located in three countries. For making this vision to
    come true, a scenario-based architecture design and requirement gathering are
    being conducted to match the needs of crops and farmers’ expertise with existing
    technological solutions. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario representing the center-pivot
    with variable-rate irrigation pilot to be deployed in the MATOPIBA region in Brazil.
    The scenario captures both the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents
    a future vision and not the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular
    agricultural plot of 100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot
    is further divided into different management zones, identified before the crop
    season and based on differences in the soil properties. Even though the crop is
    the same throughout the plot, each management zone receives a different irrigation
    prescription, to make available the same amount of water for plants regardless
    the way water is percolated and infiltrated in different soil types. Two general
    types of sensors collect data for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within
    the soil at the root system depth that continually measure metrics such as temperature
    and moisture, and; b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral
    cameras or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to
    the farm’s office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control
    the variable rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped
    with processing and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is
    predicted for the sensing devices. We will develop multiparametric probes for
    soil sensing, which include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity
    sensors at three depths from the soil surface. In intensive agriculture areas
    the plan is also to experiment ultra low power wireless sensor solutions based
    on wake up radios combined with LoRaWAN [3]. Sensors will stay on standby and
    wake up for a few milliseconds. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted
    from a few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    low power LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. We consider
    using both ZigBee and LoRaWAN, for short and long distances, respectively. Other
    sensing devices deployed in low quantity or devices requiring heavier duty cycles,
    like a water source level sensor and weather station, will be solar powered. Both
    the center pivot and drones are considered Field Fog Nodes (FFN) in the SWAMP
    Architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor aggregation
    point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the SWAMP system.
    FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the SWAMP Platform,
    which usually is an onpremises Fog Hub Node (or just fog hub) located in the farm’s
    office. Please notice that this choice aims at providing autonomous processing
    capacity to the farm at our pilot since it is in a region where Internet connections
    may suffer periods of instability. SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with
    the Platform running in the cloud, whenever this is the preferred deployment choice.
    The FFNs send data directly to the SWAMP Platform located in the CFN at the farm’s
    offices via different wireless technologies. In Fig. 7 it is represented by a
    Base Station, such as a WiFi access point, a LoRaWAN gateway, a ZigBee router
    or a Cell Base Station. For this scenario, the functions performed by the SWAMP
    Architecture are divided up into local Fog and remote Cloud components. Heavy
    processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart algorithms (i.e.,
    machine learning), is performed in the cloud. In our pilot, we will first experiment
    with existing irrigation models for precision agriculture where analytics plays
    the role of automatic parameter tuning. After enough data is obtained, analytical
    models will be tested for generating the irrigation prescription maps. External
    information is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological
    data and historical data. Fig. 7. Scenario representing the center-pivot irrigation
    pilot Show All Fig. 8 depicts the CBEC SWAMP pilot, focused on water distribution
    management. Water is conveyed from the Po River in Italy through a network of
    open canals automated by a set of pumps, valves, gauges and gates operated by
    CBEC. The SWAMP platform estimates the water needs of individual farms by analyzing
    sensor data and other relevant information, generates the irrigation prescription
    maps and sends them to the farmers, who perform the irrigation using the method
    they see fit. The water need estimate for each farm is in turn fed into a component
    devoted to optimizing the management of water distribution, by sending commands
    to actuators installed in devices that control the water flow through the canals,
    up to the point farmers can use them. The purpose is to make more efficient use
    of the water deviated from the river. Fig. 8 does not explicitly show how the
    data is sent from sensors to the SWAMP platform because different technologies
    are used by farmers to transmit the data through the Internet. The SWAMP Platform
    is represented as a single component, whereas in practice a distributed cloud/fog
    architecture can be used, such as the one shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    IoT is the natural choice for smart water management applications, but its appropriateness
    is still to be proven in real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots.
    In this paper, we presented the SWAMP project, which develops IoT based methods
    for smart water management in precision irrigation, and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. We introduced the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the
    scenario-based development process adopted in the project. SWAMP is still in its
    beginning but has already attracted the attention of farmers, agribusiness companies,
    and government agencies around the world. In its current stage, we visited and
    surveyed the pilots and explored the implications on the platform of different
    pilot sites, crops and requirements. The key insights so far refer to the commonalities
    and variability of features of pilots that can positively contribute to the design
    of a genuinely replicable SWAMP platform. Fig. 8. Scenario representing the water

    Italy SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [15] and the billions
    of sensors that will be deployed in the next decade [5], as well as novel associated
    technological breakthroughs, have been enabling the emergence of a new breed of
    smart applications and services for the benefic or our society in different domains
    or verticals, such as smart farming, smart cities, smart healthcare and smart
    industries. Building interoperable IoT services and applications requires a set
    of middleware components and system development, deployment and operation tools
    and platforms, In order to avoid developing extremely focused and vertical IoT
    applications not able to interact with other applications, common and generic
    middleware services used by different application domains become necessary. The
    widespread availability of IoT-based applications requires adequate platforms
    for both development and operation phases. The former for releasing developers
    from the need of mastering different technologies outside their core business
    and that do not add value to the process [7]. The latter for freeing organizations
    from the need of deploying and testing customized platforms for supporting the
    operation of IoT-based applications. There are some IoT platforms available today,
    both open source and proprietary [4]. There is a tradeoff in the deployment of
    such platforms, which traditionally are hosted in cloud datacenters, but are slowly
    considered to be partially moved to edge infrastructure closer to the users, which
    is known as fog computing [2]. Although many IoT platforms exist today, the arena
    is not clear regarding the suitability of them for the different deployment scenarios
    for different smart applications. IoT tools and platforms must provide an end-to-end
    treatment for the data path, since data is generated by sensors, transmitted to
    the storage place, processed by smart algorithms, decisions are made, which fire
    actions that are finally forwarded to actuators as commands aimed at changing
    some configuration. Also, scalability is a major concern for IoT platforms. It
    has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect system
    scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment
    composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data [16].
    Currently, there is no scalable de facto open IoT platform but the European Commission
    is pushing FIWARE to fill this gap. The SWAMP project develops and assesses an
    IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture
    with a hands-on approach that focuses on pilots in Italy, Spain and Brazil [9].
    The same underlying platform can be customized to different pilots considering
    different countries, climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP platform may be implemented
    in a range of deployment configurations involving both cloud and fog environments.
    In this paper, we analyze the performance of FIWARE under different platform configurations
    comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios for precision irrigation using one
    of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation scenario. Experiments consisted simulated
    sensors sending messages to FIWARE, deployed both in a fog/cloud and a cloud-only
    configuration mode. We performed experiments with a large number of probes simultaneously
    sending messages to the platform, in order to verify and understand it scalability.
    Security and privacy aspects are key components for making it possible to emergence
    of a true market for such IoT platforms for precision irrigation, such as SWAMP
    [8]. However, these aspects have not been evaluated here since they are outside
    the scope of this paper that focuses on performance and scalability of the FIWARE
    Platform when configured for the needs of SWAMP. Our results reveal interesting
    and non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing does not always improve
    the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition of a fog processing
    nodes even proved to worsen the performance. An important and unexpected factor
    in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially, we believed that
    the network would equally impact both configurations (fog/cloud and cloud-only).
    However, the impact was much higher in the fog/cloud configuration. In the remainder
    of the paper, section II presents background and related work. Section III introduces
    SWAMP and the two scenarios for the MATOPIBA pilot. Section IV provides a detailed
    view of research design and methods. The key results are presented in section
    V, followed by discussion of lessons learned in section VI. Finally, section VII
    draws some conclusions and propose relevant future work. SECTION II. Background
    and Related Work This section introduces related background and related work.
    A. IoT and Fog Computing Fog computing is a fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing
    with challenges related to the huge amount of data that inevitably will be generated
    with the increasing utilization of IoT-based systems [2]. It solves serious problems
    such as decreasing latency from real time applications, decreasing data traffic
    between the network edge and core, and softening the processing burden of the
    cloud by performing load balancing. The metaphor comes from the fact that fog
    is a cloud but closer to the ground and to the people [13]. The fog is based on
    a highly virtualized platform that provides computing, storage and communication
    services between users and the datacenter where the cloud is hosted [1], by bringing
    services from the cloud closer to the users. Since its inception the fog has been
    envisioned for operating together with the cloud for making it possible to implement
    IoT-based smart applications. In other words, fog and IoT are related yet independent
    concepts, as the fog can deal with a broader variety of applications and IoT does
    need the fog to come true. A new technological trend that has been used for implementing
    the fog is container-based virtualization that provides a lightweight alternative
    to the traditional hypervisors [12]. Containers do not emulate the underlying
    hardware. Rather, the virtualized OS communicates directly with the host OS, which
    makes the appropriate calls to the real hardware. Lightweight virtualization minimizes
    the use of computational resources of the host machine, since there is no need
    to duplicate the operating system. B. The FIWARE Platform The FIWARE platform
    (fiware.org) has been attraction general attention for being a worldwide open
    source solution fostered and funded by the European Commission under Horizon 2020
    program. It is comprised of a series of software components called Generic Enablers
    (GE) that perform functions needed in a different variety of IoT-based applications
    for smart societies, focusing in cities, farming, industry, healthcare and sustainability.
    GEs can be used to build different applications that exchange information through
    a REST API following the OMA NGSI standard (openmobilealliance.org/release/NGSI),
    based on JSON. The central aspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information
    model is the concept of entities and their attributes. Among the many GEs available
    by the FIWARE, some are considered the key enablers for smart applications. Here
    we only introduce the ones cited and used in our paper. Orion Context Broker:
    Orion is a publish/subscribe context broker, which makes it the main FIWARE GE
    and the heart of the platform. Orion provides an interface where clients can register
    entities and their attributes as well as producers/consumers of those entities.
    Orion only stores the latest version of entity attributes and it needs to work
    together with other GEs or applications in order to maintain historical data.
    Orion is available in fiware-orion.readthedocs.io. IDAS and IoT Agents: IDAS is
    an implementation of the Device Backend Management GE that comprises many IoT
    Agents that map data coming from sensors and going to actuators to the FIWARE
    NGSI information model to be stored in Orion and further processed by other GEs
    or external applications. Since low power sensors do not possess computing, storage
    and transmission capabilities for speaking NGSI, they use different IoT protocols
    such as MQTT, CoAP, Ultralight or LoRaWAN transport, which are converted into/from
    NGSI by IoT Agents. IDAS is available in catalogueserver.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-managementidas.
    STH Comet: Short Time Historic, also known as Comet, works with Orion storing
    entity data as a time series that can be further used by applications or other
    GEs. STH Comet is available in fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io. The use of FIWARE
    by any organization or developer involves the installation of its GEs in an appropriate
    infrastructure where it can run, which might be standalone machines, public clouds
    or preferentially a private cloud using the OpenStack cloud manager. FIWARE has
    been used as a computing platform for many IoT-based applications, such as farming
    and environment [14]. Also, many large scale projects use FIWARE for IoT in agriculture,
    such as IoF2020 (iof2020.eu), as well as startups such as Breeze (breeze-technologies.de),
    Hop Ubiquitous (hopu.eu) and Agricolus (agricolus.com). C. Related Work Scalability
    is a major concern for IoT platforms. Numbers vary but in general it is forecasted
    that in the beginning of the 2020’s there will be about 30 billion connected devices
    [5]. It has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect
    system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in
    an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting
    data [16]. The performance of FIWARE has been calling the attention its user community.
    A comprehensive study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates
    the performance of various IoT platforms is presented by da Cruz et al. (2018)
    [4]. From 11 platforms analyzed by the qualitative approach, 5 were selected for
    the quantitative performance analysis, including FIWARE. However, since they adopted
    a generic approach, they did not go into the specifics of FIWARE-only a single
    Orion + STH platform configuration was considered – and they did not evaluate
    different infrastructures (as fog computing). Martínez et al. (2016) [11] gives
    a detailed description of the architecture of a testbed of the FIWARE platform
    configured for the precision agriculture domain, which differs from our approach,
    because their test application connects directly to FIWARE using NGSI JSON interface,
    while we included an IoT Agent for MQTT using a scalable IoT sensor simulator
    for generating synthetic data. Lastly, Cardoso et al. (2017) [3] compared the
    performance of FIWARE and their own implementation of ETSI M2M, under different
    running conditions, which makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs of each
    platform. In this paper, we differ from previous work by evaluating five configurations
    of FIWARE and focusing on the scenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture from
    the SWAMP project [9]. SECTION III. Smart Water Management Platform The primary
    objective of the SWAMP project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot them in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil [9],
    more information can be found in swampproject.org. Also, it is aimed at improving
    precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of the condition of the crop,
    by monitoring the field based on crop status and environment, and to adjust the
    irrigation prescription map accordingly. A. SWAMP Pilots The four SWAMP pilots
    are based on the similar technical solutions and deal with different crops and
    have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy): the main objective of
    the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is optimizing water distribution
    to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain): Intercrop Iberica addresses several
    challenges since production is in a dry area and its primary goal is making a
    rational use of water. Guaspari Pilot (Espírito Santo do Pinhal / Brazil): The
    Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August)
    using irrigation techniques. The main goal for Guaspari is improving wine quality.
    MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA
    region, and irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. The main pilot goal
    is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable Rate
    Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production and save energy used
    in irrigation. The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation
    system concept for agriculture. The fundamental idea is to enable optimizations
    of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption based on a holistic analysis
    that collects information from all aspects of the system including even the natural
    water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related to growing particular plants.
    It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees the availability of water
    in situations where water supply is limited and also prevents over- and under-irrigation.
    A fundamental idea in SWAMP is to facilitate the replication of water management
    systems built on top of its platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment.
    Different layers of the architecture have components that are more generic and
    thus less difficult to be ported to other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific
    and thus require new development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. B.
    SWAMP MATOPIBA Scenario In this paper we will evaluate the performance of FIWARE
    when configured for the SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario depicted in Fig. 1 , which represents
    the center-pivot with variable-rate irrigation pilot. The scenario captures both
    the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents a future vision and not
    the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular agricultural plot of
    100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot is further divided
    into different management zones, identified before the crop season and based on
    differences in the soil properties. Two general types of sensors collect data
    for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within the soil at the root system
    depth that continuously measure metrics such as temperature and moisture, and;
    b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral cameras
    or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to the farm’s
    office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control the variable
    rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped with processing
    and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is predicted for
    the sensing devices. We developed multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which
    include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths
    from the soil surface. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted from a
    few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. The key difference between
    Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) is that the former includes a distributed fog/cloud configuration
    of the platform whereas the latter is solely based on the cloud for hosting all
    software components. Depending on different variables - such as farmers interest,
    availability of infrastructure, intended responsiveness to delay, robustness to
    disconnections, and cost/effectiveness – one or the other scenario may be more
    or less appropriate. For the MATOPIBA pilot, the preferred solution is the fog-based
    one, for providing autonomous processing capacity to the farm as it is located
    in a region where Internet connections may suffer periods of instability. Anyway,
    we evaluate both approaches because the cloud-based one might be used as well.
    In Fig. 1(a) both the center pivot and drones are deemed Field Fog Nodes (FFN)
    for the SWAMP architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor
    aggregation point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the
    SWAMP system. FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the
    SWAMP platform, which usually is an on-premises Typically, when sensors are powered
    with LoRaWAN, the FFN will host the LoRaWAN Gateway and possibly the LoRaWAN Server
    and other supplementary features. The Fog Hub is located in the farm’s office.
    SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with the platform running in the cloud,
    whenever this is the preferred deployment choice. The FFNs send data directly
    to the SWAMP platform located in the Fog Hub at the farm’s offices via different
    wireless technologies, which in Fig. 1(a) is WiFi. For this scenario, the functions
    performed by the SWAMP architecture are divided up into local fog and remote cloud
    components. Heavy processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart
    algorithms (i.e., machine learning), is performed in the cloud. External information
    is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological data and historical
    data. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) depicts a scenario where no fog is available
    and data generated by sensors are sent directly to the cloud via a typical cellular
    technology that might be 3G/4G or even NB-IoT. Fig. 1. SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario;
    a) Fog-cloud; b) Cloud-only Show All SECTION IV. Research Design and Methods A.
    Evaluation Scenario and Environment One of the main goals of this paper is to
    compare fog/cloud and cloud-only based approaches for smart water management.
    Therefore, based on the SWAMP MATOPIBA pilot specification ( Section 3), we designed
    a FIWARE-based IoT platform that involves obtaining sensor data values up to the
    point of they are transparently consumed by an application that can be deployed
    in the cloud and/or in the fog. The software modules depicted in Fig.3 and Fig.4
    are implemented by lightweight virtualization of Docker containers, including
    the FIWARE modules, whose container images can easily be obtained in that format.
    The other modules of this scenario are: SenSE: the Sensor Simulating Environment
    (SenSE, is an open-source large-scale IoT sensor data generator able to abstract
    real devices and to model different complex scenarios, such as smart farms [16].
    The tool is a traffic workload generator that emulates a huge number of heterogeneous
    sensors representing tens of thousands of IoT sensors sending data simultaneously
    via a typical IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT). Although the sensors are synthetic, the
    traffic is real. In our scenarios, SenSE generates probe data and represents the
    fog field node that forward sensor data to the platform. The source code can be
    download from github.com/ivanzy/SenSE-Sensor-Simulation-Environment. Mosquitto:
    Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source MQTT message broker. Available in mosquitto.org.
    MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database. Available in mongodb.com. Consumer:
    Consumer is a special purpose Express.js web application that subscribes in Orion
    and receives sensor data from the probes. When Orion sends a message to the consumer’s
    API, a timestamp is recorded and is subtracted from the timestamp of the message,
    in such a way we obtain the elapsed time between the generation of the message
    until it reaches the Consumer. The sequence of processing steps and data flow
    starting from the sensor data generation and ending at the consumer is shown in
    Fig. 2. This data flow is deployed in both fog and cloud-only scenarios, depicted
    in Fig. 1. SenSE generates sensor (probe) data and sends it to Mosquitto MQTT
    broker; IoT Agent receives the probe messages from the MQTT broker, stores it
    in MongoDB, translates them to the NGSI format, and finally sends it to Orion
    through HTTP protocol; Orion Context Broker receives NGSI data from the IoT Agent,
    updates entity values, stores them in MongoDB, and sends them to the subscribed
    applications through HTTP protocol and structured as NGSI; Data is delivered to
    the consumer, which stores it and calculates the elapsed since the message was
    generated in the probe (by SenSE), the consumer is subscribed to be notified from
    all probe sensors updates. Fig. 2. Processing steps and data flow Show All In
    the cloud-only experiments ( Fig.3) the sensor data is directed sent to the cloud,
    where all modules are in the same physical machine. Since both Orion and IoT Agent
    are in the same VM, both use the same MongoDB instance. In the fog experiments,
    the first two steps of processing occur in the fog node, which means that the
    MQTT broker and the IoT Agent run in the edge device, and the Orion and Consumer
    are executed in a VM in the cloud. This configuration needs a MongoDB instance
    in each machine, where the fog hosts the IoT Agent and cloud hosts Orion and the
    Consumer. In order to fully understand the evaluation scenario, one needs to comprehend
    the data model of the probe messages. We adopted the Ultralight 2.0 (UL) protocol
    – a lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications
    where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources [6]. Each probe
    consists of a set of seven sensors of three different types: Three soil temperature
    sensors in different depths; Three soil moisture sensors in different depths;
    One soil electrical conductivity sensor. Each probe sends a message every 10 minutes
    using the UL protocol over MQTT. The structure of each message is: t1|v|t2|v|t3|v|m1|v|m2|v|m3|v|c|v|ts|v
    View Source where: t1, t2, t3: temperature sensors in different depths; m1, m2,
    m3: moisture sensors in different depths; c: electrical conductivity of the soil;
    ts: timestamp of message generation; v: value of the metric. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show
    the two evaluation scenarios, cloud-only and fog/cloud, respectively. We performed
    the experiments in a lab testbed – all the VMs in the same LAN - and using a network
    emulator (WANem – available to download at wanem.sourceforge.net) to consider
    the impact of network parameters between the place where the data is generated
    (in the farm, where the sensors and fog nodes are located) and the place it is
    processed (the cloud, usually located in some datacenters placed in big cities).
    Although the case where the machines representing the fog and the cloud are in
    the same LAN does not adequately portray the reality, it is important to further
    understand the behavior of the IoT platform and what are the impacts of a constrained
    network. Fig. 3. Cloud/Only FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All Fig. 4. Fog/Cloud FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All The experiments were performed in a private cloud environment implemented
    with OpenStack in a lab testbed. As the experiments were in our own private cloud,
    we could assure that they did not suffer from outside interference from other
    virtual machines running in the same physical servers. Both fog and cloud were
    implemented using virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack, though with very different
    configurations. We used the standard Amazon AWS VM configurations: cloud VM equivalent
    to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU - 4GB of RAM) and the fog VMs (both fog field node
    and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU – 2 GB RAM). Our cloud was
    composed by 6 machines with the following configuration: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
    E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz - 8 cores and GB of RAM. Two different physical machines
    were used. B. Metrics There are two different metric used in our experiments:
    Average elapsed time: the average time elapsed since a sensor data point is generated
    in the probe until it reaches the consumer application. Basically, we are interested
    in the time elapsed since the data is collected until it is ready to be used by
    another application – such as a dashboard or an analytics module; System metrics:
    CPU and memory usage per Docker container, which allows us to observed each application,
    obtained by docker stats command every 5 seconds. C. Experiments Experiments consisted
    of SenSE simulating probes and sending messages to the IoT platform, running in
    the cloud-only configuration or in the fog/cloud configuration. We performed experiments
    with a large number of probes simultaneously sending messages to the platform,
    in order to verify and understand it scalability. Table I shows the factors and
    levels used in the performance analysis. Our experiments varied all factors with
    all levels, consisting of 16 different possibilities. Each experiment took 2 minutes
    and was replicated 30 times, totalizing 16 hours of running experiments. The asymptotic
    confidence intervals were calculated with a confidence level of 99%. Table I Factors
    and Levels To configure the emulated WAN, we tried to replicate a connection from
    a farm to a cloud. Therefore, we made a simple experiment in order to obtain the
    parameters used in the network emulator by pinging a public cloud using a 4G connection,
    and next we estimated the parameters as a 10 Mbps connection with 45ms of delay
    time and 5ms of jitter. SECTION V. Results The results for the elapsed time in
    all configurations are depicted in Fig.5, wherein one can observe the effect of
    increasing the workload in the fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios. The platform
    remained stable during almost all experiments, except for the ones performed with
    a workload of 15,000 probes - that we consider being a very high workload. The
    high confidence interval in those experiments reveals this instability. Regarding
    the comparison between the experiments with the presence of the fog and the ones
    with only the cloud, it is essential to analyze networking issues. First we analyze
    those configurations without the network effects (no WANEm emulator), and next
    the impact of the WAN in the experiments. It is important to reinforce that experiments
    without considering the impact of the network are only for a baseline comparison
    and do not reflect real scenarios. In the experiments using a local network, the
    two approaches had equivalent results, since neither the fog nor the cloud were
    overloaded. The difference between the two approaches –fog and cloud - is that
    in the fog case some software modules (Docker containers) were moved to another
    machine (representing the fog), there was no improvement in the overall performance
    of the system when the cloud was not overloaded. Therefore, our experiments revealed
    that performing load balancing between two different machines does not improve
    the performance of the system. In the case where the cloud is overloaded (15,000
    probes), distributing the processing to another machine (the fog) should have
    improved the overall performance of the system. However, the results show that
    there is an overlap between the confidence interval of the experiments with fog
    and cloud with 15000 probes, with the fog experiments having a slightly better
    performance. This occurs due to the limited computational resources of the machine
    that represents the edge device, so that when the workload increases the fog node
    becomes the bottleneck. Experiments with the network emulator (WANem) had results
    that did not confirm our intuition. In the scenarios with a low workload (1,000
    and 5,000 probes), the cloud approach has a significant better performance than
    the fog. This occurs because in the cloud experiments the network traffic was
    composed of small MQTT packets, which did not impose a major constrain to the
    network. However, in the fog experiments the MQTT traffic is only send to the
    fog, which sends a very verbose NGSI/HTTP traffic via the network to the cloud.
    This traffic suffers much more with the network constrains (latency and limited
    bandwidth). Anyway, there is a clear trade-off between the cloud and fog approaches
    when processing becomes the bottleneck, instead of the network. The almost perfect
    balance occurs with experiments with 10,000 probes, in which both approaches achieved
    the same performance. For higher workloads, the fog has a slightly better performance
    than the cloud. The system metrics – RAM and CPU usage - for the cloud-only experiments
    are depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, for the fog/cloud experiments are showed in
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Since the workload in the system is very similar with and without
    the network, we opted to portrait only the results performed considering the network,
    since they illustrate the whole set of experiments. The experiments using the
    fog approach, there were two MongoDB instances - in the fog to help the IoT Agent
    and in the cloud connected to Orion - are identified as Mongo-fog and Mongo-cloud
    respectively. Analyzing Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, it becomes clear that the container
    that demands more processing and it is the potential bottleneck of the system
    is MongoDB. Also, when comparing the cloud-only and fog/cloud results for the
    CPU usage, it is possible to infer that Orion imposes a higher workload in, since
    when the IoT Agent is on the fog node, MongoDB in the cloud has only an approximately
    20% decrease of CPU usage. Unlike the CPU usage, the memory usage has a stable
    behavior, even with the increase of the workload, as shown by Fig.7 for the cloud
    experiments, and in Fig. 9 for the fog experiments. However, there is also a decrease
    of approximately 20% of memory usage when the IoT-Agent is moved to the fog, with
    its own instance of MongoDB. Fig. 5. Response time for the cloud and fog configurations

    SECTION VI. Discussion The experiments were successful in replicating a large-scale
    smart farm environment considering the number of sensors. Also, they showed that
    fog computing does not always improve the overall system performance. However,
    there are complex issues to evaluated in opting for a cloud or a fog approach
    beyond simply adding a machine in the edge of the network. There is a non-trivial
    trade-off between the given application, the available infrastructure and the
    system workload. In the SWAMP scenarios, we expect a smaller number of sensors,
    due to costs and farm sizes, and therefore the experiments that better represent
    real case scenarios are the ones with 1,000 and 5,000 probes. In those cases,
    the addition of a fog processing node proved to be a downgrade regarding performance.
    Nevertheless, the fog has others benefits that compensate the lack of performance.
    In farms in the inward countryside of Brazil, when there is Internet connectivity,
    it is frequently unstable and limited, suffering from frequent disconnections.
    In this case, the fog node is responsible to store sensor data and keep a subset
    of services online when there is no connection to the Internet. An important and
    unexpected factor in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially,
    we believed that the network would equally impact both configurations fog and
    cloud). However, the impact was much higher in the fog configuration. This happens
    because the traffic of JSON/HTTP packets suffer more from network constrains than
    the lightweight UL 2.0 MQTT traffic. Therefore, when deploying a solution in a
    real environment, there is the need to analyze if the gain in processing part
    of the data in another device (the fog) will overcome the limitations imposed
    by the network. Another solution is to use a lightweight protocol when sending
    the data to the cloud form the fog. This set of experiments created higher awareness
    about the scalability tradeoffs of the FIWARE IoT platform. A major concern is
    regarding the default database used by Orion and the IoT Agent (i.e. MongoDB)
    that was the major bottleneck of the experiments. It is a known fact that MongoDB
    does scale as well as other NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra [10]. In the FIWARE
    documentation, there is no guide or configuration regarding using a different
    database for both software and it seems that they were hardcoded for working with
    MongoDB. FIWARE could potentially increase its scalability if it allows the of
    more efficient databases other than MongoDB. Another solution is to place MongoDB
    in a dedicated machine. Although FIWARE has a scalability ceiling due to MongoDB,
    it is suitable for most of the IoT scenarios in smart farms, being capable to
    handle 10,000 probes without major performance issues. It is proven to be a reliable
    tool with several advantages. It provides a standard communication format between
    all services in a given system through the NGSI information model. FIWARE also
    provides a transparent way to applications – such as dashboards and analytics
    – to consume sensor data. The IoT Agent can handle data from different sensors
    and translate them to a standard NGSI and automatically send this data to Orion,
    whose API is very flexible and able to add new sensors on-the-fly. Orion also
    proved to be a reliable and useful tool to manage context information, as it stores
    the last data point of each attribute and provides a simple API to consult it.
    Also, by using the subscribe operation in Orion, applications do not need to perform
    polling in the interesting devices. Rather, when data is changed, Orion notifies
    the subscribed application. SECTION VII. Conclusion We analyzed the performance
    of FIWARE under different platform configurations comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only
    scenarios for precision irrigation using one of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation
    scenario. Our results reveal non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing
    does not always improve the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition
    of a fog processing nodes even proved to worsen the performance. Also, the network
    between the farm and the cloud datacenter causes some unexpected differences between
    different scenarios. The results presented in this paper reveal the tip of the
    iceberg. In order to fully understand the tradeoffs involved in using IoT platforms
    and particularly FIWARE, we need to broaden our scope and perform experiments
    in different configurations, pilots and in scenarios beyond smart farming. Authors

    How much is enough in watering

    plants? State-of-the-art in

    irrigation control: Advances,

    challenges, and opportunities

    with respect to precision

    irrigation

    Lina Owino* and Dirk Söffker

    Germany

    With a rapidly expanding global population placing an ever growing demand on

    freshwater resources, an increased focus on irrigation techniques tailored to
    the

    speciﬁc needs of plant appears as one solution to minimize overall freshwater

    consumption. Precision irrigation methods seek to realize an acceptable

    compromise

    between

    yield

    and

    irrigation

    water consumption

    through

    control of the timing and quantity of water supplied to plants. The goal is to

    maintain the water content of the soil, achieve speciﬁc water use efﬁciency with

    regard to yield or maintain the physiological response of the plant to water

    stress within predetermined limits. Reliance on soil moisture measurements to

    establish irrigation water demand inadequately addresses heterogenous

    distribution of water in soil. Growing research interest is observed detailing

    the determination of plant water status directly from physiological responses.

    This paper reviews irrigation control approaches based on different plant water

    status assessment techniques. A distinct focus is made on application scale of

    the discussed control approaches, an aspect that has not been considered

    intensively enough in previous discussions of irrigation control approaches. A

    discussion of the observed strengths and shortcomings and technological

    advances supporting the various methods used to quantify plant water status

    extends the review. Emerging trends that are likely to have an impact on plant

    water status determination and optimal timing and quantiﬁcation of irrigation

    water requirements are integrated to show latest results. A peek into the future

    of precision irrigation foresees greater reliance on plant-based signals, both
    in

    characterization of the control variable, namely the plant water status, and in

    generation of controller outputs in terms of quantity and timing.

    1 Introduction

    As the world advances further into the 21st century, a rapidly

    growing global population continues to exert greater demand on

    agricultural food production (van Dijk et al., 2021). The effects of

    climate change provide an additional challenge to traditional

    rain- and reservoir-based crop production, making the case for

    use of irrigation either exclusively throughout the growing

    season, or as a supplement to natural precipitation (Wada

    et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2020). Maintaining crop yields from

    the available land area, using a diminishing quantity of the

    required freshwater for irrigation is a delicate balancing act

    that has acted as a motivation for extensive research in

    precision irrigation approaches, with the overall goal of

    maximizing water use efﬁciency of irrigated crops, while

    simultaneously meeting the rising global food demand.

    While water treatment and desalination provide alternatives

    to cover the freshwater need, existing techniques are costly and

    energy intensive, particularly at low to medium scale (Arborea

    et al., 2017; Hagenvoort et al., 2019; Arena et al., 2020;

    Oubelkacem et al., 2020; Ofori et al., 2021). Concerns about

    the safety of treated wastewater, even with application of

    advanced treatment methods, have resulted in a call to more

    rigorous regulation and combination of treatment processes

    (Rizzo et al., 2020). Freshwater generation via atmospheric

    water harvesting (Tu et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022) offers a

    novel, but energy intensive alternative which is currently

    limited to smaller production units (LaPotin et al., 2021). As a

    conclusion optimization of crop irrigation appears to be the most

    suitable solution to achieve a sustainable compromise between

    increasing freshwater demand for food production and the

    associated energy and environmental costs to realize adequate

    global food supply.

    In the history of mankind, adequate food production has

    been a fundamental requirement in the growth and advancement

    of human society. As early as 5000 BC, early agricultural

    civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia had come upon the

    idea of expanding the extent of arable land through use of

    irrigation, making use of the ﬂoodwaters of the Nile, Tigris,

    and Euphrates which was diverted into arable farmlands

    bordering the rivers through an extensive network of canals

    (Bazza, 2007). Through the use of intricate systems of canals,

    with later additions of reservoirs, dikes, and overﬂow canals,

    ﬂooding could be mitigated (Grenfell et al., 1900; Westermann,

    1919). Similar implementation of surface irrigation was also

    recorded in ancient China, Crete, India, and Persia (Biswas,

    1970). Irrigation control in this case was focused on direction

    of irrigation water to speciﬁc locations, regulation of irrigation

    duration and mitigation of ﬂooding. Surface irrigation methods

    involving use of ﬂooded basins, furrows, dykes, dams, and

    artiﬁcial reservoirs remain the predominant form of irrigation

    to date (Jägermeyr et al., 2015). Control methods aimed at more

    efﬁcient use of irrigation water have been targeted at regulating

    the timing, duration, and frequency of supply to the ﬁelds

    through control of gates, sluices, valves, and pumps.

    Introduction of new methods of water application to

    plants in the ﬁeld, namely through sprinklers and drip

    lines, provided new opportunities for more accurate control

    of irrigation water supply, allowing the regulation of water

    supply down to the individual plant level. These developments

    on the actuation side of irrigation have been accompanied by

    corresponding

    developments

    in

    sensing

    and

    control

    approaches.

    The incorporation of spatial variability in the management of

    irrigation is a key concept in distinguishing between traditional

    irrigation and precision irrigation (Sadler et al., 2005; Smith and

    Baillie, 2009). In Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2010), a distinction is

    made between traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation,

    which

    focus

    on

    maximizing

    efﬁciency

    through

    precise

    determination of volume, location and timing of irrigation,

    with uniform application over the entire system, and an

    updated deﬁnition that incorporates spatial and temporal

    variation in irrigation treatment. The focus is shifted from

    ﬁeld level to management zones within the ﬁeld (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2014; Fernández, 2017), or to individual plant

    level (Kizer et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2018). Camp et al.

    describe

    precision

    irrigation

    as

    “site-speciﬁc

    water

    management, speciﬁcally the application of water to a given

    site in a volume and at a time needed for optimum crop

    production, proﬁtability, or other management objectives at

    that speciﬁc site” (Camp et al., 2006). In this review, the

    supporting technologies are considered with regard to their

    ﬂexibility in allowing variable precision irrigation of individual

    plants or zones, rather than achieving efﬁciency through

    generation of uniform irrigation schedules.

    Traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation consider the

    “precise amount” of water to be applied to be the full amount of

    water required to meet the plant demand, which has commonly

    been determined based on the relationship between crop

    evapotranspiration and environmental factors (Morillo et al.,

    2015; Morales et al., 2016). Current irrigation practices that

    explore the cultivation of irrigated crops under regulated

    water deﬁcit provide a new Frontier for precision irrigation,

    where the required amount to be delivered is determined with a

    goal of avoiding irreversible water stress damage, without

    necessarily

    fully

    matching

    evapotranspiration-based

    plant

    demands. This provides further avenues for improvement of

    water use efﬁciency. Deﬁcit irrigation-based applications of

    precision irrigation approaches have been employed in control

    of both pre- and post-harvest yield quality (Pérez-Pastor et al.,

    2007; Lipan et al., 2019; Venturi et al., 2021). The observed effect

    of deﬁcit irrigation approaches on crop maturation (Zegbe-

    Domínguez et al., 2003; Cui et al., 2008) is an additional

    research target, with the possibility to enhance economic

    outcomes for the farmer by matching harvest timing to

    periods of greatest market demand. In this review, precision

    supporting future development in precision irrigation control

    (Neupane and Guo, 2019; Bodkhe et al., 2020; Han et al.,

    2020).

    This

    review

    similarly

    provide

    a

    comprehensive

    summary of monitoring, control, and actuation approaches

    applied in precision irrigation control. Additionally, the

    implementability of deﬁcit irrigation-based strategies for

    increased water use efﬁciency is addressed, allowing the

    extension of achievable water savings thus contributing to

    sustainable expansion of global food production without

    exhausting available freshwater resources.

    2 Precision irrigation control

    approaches

    Control techniques are broadly classiﬁed as open or closed

    loop, deﬁning the existence of any kind of calculated or otherwise

    technically realized feedback (output to the input of the system

    considered). Open loop precision irrigation control relies on an

    accurate understanding (in the best case: a model) of plant water

    requirements, while closed loop methods include sensing

    mechanisms to dynamically adjust the control input to the

    irrigation system based on measured values.

    The performance of precision irrigation control approaches

    depends on the deﬁnition of plant water requirements. The

    characterization of plant water demand and the subsequent

    responses to the water application is described in Kögler

    (Kögler and Söffker, 2017) along a soil-plant-atmosphere

    continuum.

    This

    paper

    similarly

    groups

    approaches

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    into

    soil-based,

    plant-based,

    and

    atmosphere-based approaches. Further distinction is made

    between approaches targeted at enhancing precise delivery at

    ﬁeld level, within irrigation management zones and at individual

    plant level.

    2.1 Soil-based approaches

    Growing plants obtain water required for their growth from

    the soil. The soil moisture content has therefore been applied as a

    measure of the water status of the plant, with a plant-speciﬁc

    lower limit describing the minimum moisture content required

    to maintain the plant above wilting point (Briggs and Shantz,

    1911) and a soil-speciﬁc maximum water holding capacity, also

    referred to as the ﬁeld capacity (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson,

    1931). The main goal of traditional irrigation methods is to

    maintain soil moisture content at ﬁeld capacity during the

    growth phases, with scheduling of irrigation events based on

    plant growth models such as FAO Aquacrop (Steduto et al., 2009)

    or multivariable models simulating soil moisture, plant growth,

    and evapotranspiration such as DSSAT (Hoogenboom et al.,

    2019).

    Model-based predictive control approaches applied in

    precision irrigation allow the integration of soil moisture

    models

    in

    a

    predictive

    control

    scheme,

    which

    allows

    forecasting of moisture content and update of control actions

    based on measured variables. Spatial and temporal variability is

    accounted for using regression models (Hedley C. and Yule I.,

    2009), a predictive model with weekly measurement-based

    updates performing online optimization (Nahar et al., 2019),

    employment of Kalman ﬁlters (Roy, 2014), and application of

    deep belief networks and macroscopic cellular automata, with

    dynamic environmental measurements providing additional data

    for prediction (Song et al., 2016).

    The learning capabilities of neural networks allows the

    adaptation of plant growth models for the design of precision

    irrigation controllers. Speciﬁc neural-network based approaches

    allow online updating of control decisions based on measured

    real-time conditions, resulting in more accurate behavior. These

    capabilities are utilized by Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) in

    the development of an adaptive closed loop controller that allows

    for

    modiﬁcation

    of

    control

    actions

    when

    environmental

    perturbations such as rainfall or extreme temperatures cause a

    change in irrigation requirements. Long short term memory

    neural networks are employed for prediction of soil moisture

    content (Adeyemi et al., 2018) or soil matric potential Jimenez

    et al. (2020) with varying performance, both in terms of water

    savings and prediction accuracy. These are attributed to soil

    characteristics and duration of the prediction window. Difference

    in performance of neural network-based predictive models are

    also reported by (Gu et al., 2021), with larger estimation errors

    observed at lower soil moisture content levels, affecting

    performance of the precision irrigation scheduling system.

    A major challenge in the use of model-based methods for

    precision irrigation is that the control performance is limited by

    the accuracy of prediction or estimation achieved by the model.

    Incorporation of soil moisture data into irrigation management

    decisions offers a signiﬁcant performance improvement in soil-

    based precision irrigation approaches. Sensor readings have been

    used to calibrate and reﬁne model output, as described in (Tseng

    et al., 2018), where soil moisture measurements are used in

    labelling images acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle for

    training a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. Conversely,

    application of predictive models can be integrated in sensor-

    based control approaches to reduce the quantity of sensor

    readings required to make an accurate assessment of soil

    water content, as proposed in (De Benedetto et al., 2013b)

    and (Andugula et al., 2017).

    Soil-based closed loop control methods integrate soil

    moisture measurements in the control loop. On/off switching

    algorithms triggered by designated soil moisture sensors with

    preset static thresholds have been employed in precision

    irrigation control by Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2010). Use of

    dynamic switching thresholds allows real-time response to

    ﬁeld

    conditions,

    with

    the

    adaptation

    of

    the

    thresholds

    accomplished in Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) by

    neural networks, and numerical simulation employed by Egea

    et al. (Egea et al., 2017). An alternative approach involves

    placement of sensors at varying depths to track inﬁltration

    rate, allowing anticipatory switching (Benzekri and Refouﬁ,

    2006; Zhao et al., 2007; Liu and Xu, 2018).

    Development of a large variety of soil moisture sensors with

    greater accuracy and reliability has facilitated the precision

    control of irrigation based on real-time conditions. A major

    challenge to implementation of sensor-based control approaches

    has been the unit cost of sensors, which limits the economic

    viability of ﬁeld scale application of appropriately accurate and

    precise sensors. New low-cost soil moisture sensors have been

    developed in recent times based on sensing approaches

    commonly used in commercially available sensors, including

    frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR) (Xiao et al., 2010),

    time

    domain

    reﬂectometry

    (TDR)

    (Wei

    et

    al.,

    2013),

    impedance

    spectroscopy

    (Umar

    and

    Setiadi,

    2015),

    and

    capacitance-based methods (Kojima et al., 2016; Gao et al.,

    2018). Novel approaches in the measurement of soil moisture

    content have also been developed in recent times, such as a time-

    domain multiplexing approach described in Saeed et al. (Saeed

    et al., 2019) and a high frequency double-resonance tuning

    approach developed by Qinglan et al. (Qinglan et al., 2020).

    Ding and Chandra introduce a Wi-Fi-based measurement

    system that relies on radio-frequency propagation (Ding and

    Chandra, 2019). Development of more precise calibration

    techniques and incorporation of fault detection mechanisms

    generates an opportunity for improvement of measurement

    accuracy and ﬂexibility of application in both novel and

    existing soil moisture sensors (Oates et al., 2016; Chen L.

    et al., 2019; González-Teruel et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,

    2019). Additionally, dynamically variable irrigation thresholds

    based on plant growth requirements can be incorporated through

    calibration based on plant measurements. This is employed in

    Lou et al. (Lou et al., 2016) to generate a set of soil potential

    thresholds that allows precision irrigation through different plant

    growth stages.

    Location and distribution of moisture sensors within the ﬁeld

    has traditionally relied on expert knowledge from manufacturers

    or farmers. Approaches for optimizing the spatial distribution of

    soil moisture sensors for improved mapping of water content

    include use of clay percentile (Zhao W. et al., 2017), analysis of

    soil elevation maps combined with measurement of electrical

    conductivity (Adamchuk et al., 2010), and application of graph-

    theoretical methods (Roy, 2014).

    Field level precision irrigation based on soil moisture content

    relies on accurately modeling and/or measurement of soil water

    dynamics, incorporating the effects of precipitation, irrigation,

    leaching, run-off, and drainage to establish the moisture available

    within the root zone of the plant. Precision irrigation control

    approaches are therefore employed primarily to address accuracy

    of moisture content measurement and monitoring, and the

    scheduling the timing and quantity of ﬁeld-level irrigation

    events. Remote sensing techniques capable of extracting soil

    moisture characteristics with increasing precision and more

    frequent intervals is a key factor in the further development

    of soil-based precision irrigation at ﬁeld level. Electromagnetic

    surveys have been applied in (Hedley et al., 2013) to assess the

    spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture and water table depth

    for precision irrigation control. Satellite data are also used to

    determine the soil water index, which is used as an indicator of

    soil moisture content (Termite et al., 2019).

    Zone level precision irrigation relies on accurate demarcation

    of the ﬁeld into homogeneous management zones based on

    physical and chemical characteristics of the soil (Bazzi et al.,

    2018; de Lara et al., 2018; Chen S. et al., 2019). Integration of

    plant-related

    measurements

    to

    complement

    soil

    sensor

    measurements has been explored in (Rojo et al., 2016; Ortuani

    et al., 2019; Vera et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2020) for better zone

    delineation as a means to increasing irrigation efﬁciency. Recent

    research investigates the adoption of Bayesian maximum entropy

    (Han et al., 2020) and clustering approaches (Haghverdi et al.,

    2015; Oldoni and Bassoi, 2016; Ohana-Levi et al., 2019; Javadi

    et al., 2022) for achievement of optional zoning. To address

    challenges arising from static management zone delineation

    based on spatial characterization, dynamic determination of

    zone boundaries has been explored with integration of real-

    time soil and plant sensor measurements (Scudiero et al.,

    2018;

    Fontanet

    et

    al.,

    2020)

    or

    use

    of

    deep

    learning

    approaches (Song et al., 2016).

    With regard to the current status of soil-based precision

    irrigation control approaches summarized in Table 1, it can be

    stated that the maintenance of soil moisture level between a user-

    deﬁned lower boundary related to the wilting point and an upper

    boundary deﬁned by the soil water capacity has been employed as

    the basis for control decisions. Challenges related to soil water

    dynamics arising from inherent hydraulic characteristics or

    changes in the spatial envelope deﬁning root-available water

    have been addressed. Optimization of location and distribution

    of soil moisture sensors to allow accurate mapping of soil

    moisture distribution while minimizing the required number

    of sensors is a potential area for further work in the

    implementation

    of

    sensor-supported

    soil-based

    precision

    irrigation control. Variations in the upper soil moisture

    boundary during scheduling of irrigation quantity has not

    been

    considered

    in

    literature,

    signifying

    a

    gap

    in

    the

    application of soil-based precision irrigation methods to

    deﬁcit irrigation strategies. Additionally, a signiﬁcant gap

    exists in soil-based approaches applied at individual plant level.

    Advancements in the ﬁeld of wireless sensor networks, remote

    sensing and machine learning approaches are expected to drive

    future developments in soil-based precision irrigation control,

    allowing for more localized decision support systems and greater

    adaptability to individual plant water requirements.

    2.2 Atmosphere-based approaches

    Atmosphere-based precision irrigation control approaches

    involve balancing the water supplied to the plant with the water

    released

    to

    the

    atmosphere

    through

    evapotranspiration.

    Achievement of the high accuracy required in precision

    irrigation

    is

    either

    accomplished

    by

    reﬁning

    evapotranspiration models for use in open loop control or by

    incorporation of sensor feedback in closed loop control.

    Common models of evapotranspiration incorporated into

    precision irrigation include FAO’s Penman-Monteith model

    (Allen, 1998; Fourati et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2017;

    Pereira

    et

    al.,

    2020),

    the

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985; Gordin et al., 2019; Pelosi

    et al., 2019; Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020) and the Surface

    Energy Balance model (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998;

    Gobbo

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Both

    the

    Penman-Monteith

    and

    Hargreaves-Samani models generate an estimated reference

    evapotranspiration rate, which is multiplied by a crop-speciﬁc

    coefﬁcient to predict the actual evapotranspiration rate of the

    crop.

    The

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    provides

    a

    simpler

    approach due to its ability to provide an estimate based solely

    on temperature values, as compared to the Penman-Monteith

    approach, where several environmental, geographic and soil-

    related variables are required. Better temporal stability in

    evapotranspiration prediction accuracy using the Hargreaves-

    Samani approach has also been reported in (Lorite et al., 2015),

    making it a more reliable option for control approaches

    integrating longer prediction windows. The SEBAL approach

    directly computes the actual evapotranspiration rate from

    thermal imagery without requiring speciﬁc soil- or crop-

    related coefﬁcients, making it more readily applicable to new

    or inadequately researched crop varieties for which physiological

    coefﬁcients are yet to be established.

    Machine learning approaches have more recently been

    applied in estimation of evapotranspiration, and hence plant

    water requirements, based on weather data (Sidhu et al., 2020;

    Farooque et al., 2021). Linker et al. use temperature forecasts to

    estimate evapotranspiration values, which are applied in

    precision scheduling of irrigation to achieve targeted optimal

    combinations of yield and irrigation amount selected by the

    farmer (Linker et al., 2018). Estimation of evapotranspiration

    using remote sensing data is employed in Barker et al. (Barker

    et al., 2018) for variable rate irrigation control. In Ma et al., the

    Root Zone Water Quality Model is calibrated using lysimeter

    measurements for estimation of plant evapotranspiration, which

    is then applied in irrigation scheduling (Ma et al., 2017). The

    authors suggest further improvement of irrigation scheduling by

    inclusion of weather forecasting data. Improvements in water use

    efﬁciency are observed in this case. However, due to the

    implementation

    of

    an

    open-loop

    control,

    real-time

    evapotranspiration values play no role in the decision-making,

    making the system susceptible to environmental variations. For

    greenhouse-based applications (Incrocci et al., 2014), developed a

    data-driven evapotranspiration model for precision irrigation

    control, achieving a 45% reduction in seasonal water use.

    An

    alternative

    atmospheric-based

    approach

    relies

    on

    prediction of precipitation rather than evapotranspiration

    (Roy,

    2014;

    Tsakmakis

    et

    al.,

    2016).

    Roy

    introduces

    a

    stochastic

    weather

    forecasting

    module

    for

    predicting

    precipitation (Roy, 2014) using publicly available weather

    forecasts. Tsakmakis et al. use a weather prognostics model

    based on the air pollution model (Hurley, 2005), which

    predicts

    precipitation

    by

    solving

    given

    scalar

    equations.

    Irrigation scheduling is adjusted based on predicted timing

    and quantities of precipitation.

    Hybrid approaches combining ET estimation with soil

    moisture sensing (Lozoya et al., 2016; Nocco et al., 2019;

    Bhatti et al., 2020) or plant-based methods (Tsakmakis et al.,

    2016; Gobbo et al., 2019) have also been used to achieve greater

    accuracy

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control.

    These

    allow

    compensation

    of

    weather-related

    disturbances

    to

    the

    evapotranspiration model by integrating the dynamic behavior

    of soil moisture or of the plant. However their reliability depends

    on the accuracy of crop coefﬁcients used in determination of

    actual evapotranspiration.

    A major challenge in atmospheric-based precision irrigation

    approaches arises from the difﬁculty in differentiating between

    evaporation (from the soil surface) and transpiration (from the

    plants), requiring dynamic adjustment of irrigation control

    algorithms as plant cover increases during the growth season.

    A recent approach described by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2020)

    involves the partitioning of evapotranspiration values into its two

    components through machine learning techniques. This could

    provide a key to achieving greater accuracy in precision irrigation

    control, allowing the focusing of water delivery to meet actual

    plant demand rather than maintaining constant soil moisture

    levels, including in areas where no plant growth is present. A

    summary of existing atmosphere-based control approaches is

    provided in Table 2.

    2.3 Plant-based approaches

    To alleviate the gaps inherent in soil-based and atmospheric-

    based precision control approaches, plant-based precision

    irrigation control has been widely seen as the best approach

    in accurately determining and meeting plant water requirements

    (Jones, 2004). The timing and quantity of irrigation is based on

    the plant physiological response to lack of water, which results in

    changes in leaf surface temperature, water potential, or turgor

    (Ayars and Phene, 2007).

    Canopy temperature-based crop water stress indices (CWSI),

    both based on theoretical (Idso et al., 1981) and experimental

    models (Jackson et al., 1981) have been employed in irrigation

    scheduling since the early 1980s. Due to their reliance on canopy

    temperature measurements taken at a speciﬁc time of day

    (typically midday), they are constrained in their adaptability

    to dynamically varying stress conditions. Applications of

    CWSI

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control

    are

    described

    in

    O’Shaughnessy et al. (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), where a

    cumulative

    time

    threshold

    is

    incorporated

    in

    the

    determination of irrigation timing, and in Osroosh et al.

    (Osroosh

    et

    al.,

    2015),

    where

    a

    dynamic

    threshold

    is

    implemented to account for changes in water stress thresholds

    at different growing stages. A recent approach described by

    Andrade et al. (Andrade et al., 2018) is the implementation of

    machine learning algorithms for forecasting of crop water stress

    indices based on historic data.

    Advancements in canopy temperature measurements have

    contributed greatly to the development of plant-based precision

    irrigation approaches. High resolution satellite thermal images

    have been used for mapping of plant water stress levels for site-

    speciﬁc irrigation scheduling, with the capability to replace

    locally obtained leaf water potential (LWP) measurements

    (Meron et al., 2010). At a local level, thermal imagery

    obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2013; Martínez et al., 2016; Matese et al., 2018) or

    all-terrain vehicles moving within the irrigated ﬁeld (Gutiérrez

    et al., 2018) has been used in mapping of plant water

    requirements for generation of irrigation management zones.

    At plant level, surface temperature sensors mounted on

    individual leaves have been applied to allow continuous

    monitoring of stress status (Rojo et al., 2016; Kizer et al., 2018).

    Determination of plant water status by measurement of water

    potential in a pressure chamber was ﬁrst described by Dixon and

    Joly in 1895 (Dixon and Joly, 1895). Various approaches have

    been developed for determination of water potential, with

    measurements taken either from the leaves or from the stem

    (SWP). Water potential measurement is done either directly on

    the plant (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Blanco-Cipollone et al.,

    2017) or estimated from multispectral imagery (Baluja et al.,

    2012; Zhao T. et al., 2017; Beeri et al., 2018; Helman et al., 2018;

    Tung et al., 2018). Precision irrigation control approaches based

    on use of plant water potential-based thresholds for triggering of

    irrigation events are described by (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010;

    Bellvert et al., 2015; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016) and (Ruiz-

    Sánchez et al., 2018). The application of machine learning

    approaches enables integration of historical water potential

    measurements

    to

    predict

    spatial

    variations

    in

    water

    requirements, as described in (Pôças et al., 2020). An

    alternative method

    involves the use of

    water potential

    thresholds

    as

    the

    standard

    for

    calibration

    of

    other

    measurement approaches, such as trunk diameter shrinkage

    and growth rate (Livellara et al., 2011). Near infra-red

    spectroscopy

    measurements

    have

    also

    been

    applied

    in

    precision irrigation control, as described by (Diago et al., 2018).

    Water is required for the maintenance of turgor pressure

    in plants. Plant water status can therefore be monitored or

    measured through measurement of turgor. Developments

    related

    to

    leaf

    turgor

    measurements

    and

    potential

    application

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    are

    described

    in

    (Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Dominguez et al.,

    2019). A novel approach employing ultrasonic sensing

    techniques for determination of leaf water content as

    related to turgor pressure is described in (Álvarez-Arenas

    et

    al.,

    2016),

    allowing

    for

    non-contact

    application

    of

    turgor-based precision irrigation control.

    Other emerging methods of assessing plant water status that

    could provide useful feedback for precision irrigation control

    include measurement of leaf thickness (Seelig et al., 2011), trunk

    diameter (Conejero et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2017), leaf reﬂectance

    (Katsoulas et al., 2016) and various applications of image analysis

    (Hendrawan and Murase, 2009; Chen et al., 2018; Mateo-Aroca

    et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). The demarcation of irrigation

    management zones based on plant-based sensors is also a

    potential area of exploration (Bazzi et al., 2018), allowing the

    realization of zone-based irrigation control that better matches

    the plant water requirements.

    In general, while plant-based approaches (summarized in

    Table 3) provide the closest match to plant water requirements,

    there still exist open questions regarding the determination of

    appropriate

    irrigation

    quantity,

    the

    distinguishing

    of

    physiological responses to water stress from other stresses,

    and the dynamic adaptation of irrigation control to account

    for physiological coping mechanisms employed by plants in

    response to water stress.

    The interaction between the soil, plant and atmosphere

    provides a broad spectrum of combinations for precision

    irrigation control approaches. Selection of a suitable approach

    depends

    on

    the

    speciﬁc

    soil,

    plant

    and

    environmental

    characteristics under consideration, as well as the desired scale

    of application. While signiﬁcant progress has been made in

    development of ﬁeld-level and zone-based precision irrigation

    applications using all three approaches, there remains a

    signiﬁcant gap in plant-level precision irrigation control,

    which has the potential to further improve the efﬁciency of

    irrigation water supply to meet actual plant demand.

    3 Advances in precision irrigation

    The development of precision irrigation control has beneﬁted

    from technological advances in various ﬁelds. In this section, the

    technological advances contributing to precision irrigation

    control are discussed under three main categories: sensor

    development and data acquisition, data processing and control

    approaches, and actuating devices. Speciﬁc elements of Industry

    4.0 are directly addressed in each section.

    3.1 Advances in sensing

    3.1.1 Remote sensing

    Greater availability of satellite data has provided a signiﬁcant

    boost to integration of remote sensor data in precision irrigation

    applications. The soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS)

    satellite (Kerr et al., 2010) launched by the European Space

    Agency and the soil moisture active and passive (SMAP)

    (Entekhabi et al., 2010) satellite by NASA have in particular

    been

    instrumental

    in

    furthering

    research

    on

    remote

    measurement and monitoring of soil water content. Drought

    assessment using soil water deﬁcit indices derived from SMOS

    Martínez-Fernández et al. (2016) and SMAP (Zhu et al., 2019)

    enables the tracking of changes in soil moisture content over

    time, enabling precision irrigation management. In (Brocca et al.,

    2018), satellite data are used to quantify amount of irrigation

    water supplied at various sites, demonstrating the potential of

    applying remote sensing data to monitoring and control tasks

    associated

    with

    precision

    irrigation.

    The

    challenge

    of

    downscaling regional scale satellite data for local application,

    such as in precision irrigation, is presented in (Peng et al., 2017),

    with a discussion of satellite-based, geoinformation-based, and

    model-base approaches. A key limitation of microwave satellites

    is that soil moisture information describes the surface condition

    rather

    than

    root

    zone

    characteristics.

    The

    Global

    Land

    Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (Martens et al.,

    2017) provides a set of algorithms allowing estimation of

    root-zone soil moisture and evaporation from satellite data,

    allowing for incorporation into precision irrigation strategies.

    Termite et al. (Termite et al., 2019) describe the harnessing of

    machine learning capabilities in analysis of satellite imagery to

    predict soil moisture dynamics for application in irrigation

    decision support systems.

    3.1.2 Wireless sensor networks

    Advancements in wireless sensor network technology have

    led to improved collection and analysis of sensor data for high

    resolution mapping of soil moisture (Zhao et al., 2007; Xiao

    et al., 2010; Hedley et al., 2013). Real-time communication

    between

    sensors,

    actuators,

    and

    human

    users

    is

    easily

    achievable

    over

    locally

    available

    telecommunications

    infrastructure and interfaces can be implemented on mobile

    hand-held devices (Işık et al., 2017). An expansion of sensor

    networking has seen the rise of Internet-of-Things-based

    sensing applied for monitoring of plant water requirements,

    whether via soil-based, atmosphere-based, or plant-based

    measurements (Vasisht et al., 2017; Goap et al., 2018; Munir

    et al., 2018). Integration of wireless sensor networks has also

    found

    application

    in

    dynamic

    delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    for

    zone-based

    precision

    irrigation

    control in Sapna et al. (Sapna et al., 2020).

    3.2 Advances in data processing and

    control

    3.2.1 Big data

    The vast quantities of data generated from networked sensors

    generate a need for expanded processing and storage capabilities.

    In this respect, cloud computing approaches provide a viable

    solution, ﬁnding application in monitoring of real-time irrigation

    status (López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Vaishali et al., 2017) and

    modeling of plant water requirements for soil-based (Raikar

    et al., 2018; Mezouari et al., 2020), plant-based (Roopaei et al.,

    2017), and atmosphere-based (Bendre et al., 2015) precision

    irrigation control approaches. Data analysis techniques applied

    on Big Data applications are also proving beneﬁcial in

    management of precision irrigation control systems (Zhang

    et al., 2017).

    3.2.2 Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence

    Machine learning involves generation of self-modifying

    or

    adapting

    algorithms

    whose

    performance

    accuracy

    increases

    with

    experience

    (Marsland,

    2014).

    Machine

    learning techniques have been crucial in development of

    dynamic

    control

    approaches

    through

    integration

    of

    learning capabilities. Applications in the area of precision

    irrigation are primarily in predictive modeling of soil

    moisture dynamics (Hinnell et al., 2010; Adeyemi et al.,

    2018) and optimized irrigation scheduling (Jimenez et al.,

    2018;

    Murthy

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Recent

    research

    involves

    application of Machine learning algorithms to identify new

    parameters that can be employed in characterization of plant

    water content, primarily through image analysis (Hendrawan

    and Murase, 2009).

    3.2.3 Multi-agent systems

    Multi-agent systems expand the capabilities of artiﬁcial

    intelligence by introducing multiple autonomous intelligent

    agents capable of interacting with each other. Multi-agent

    systems have been employed in simulation of plant growth

    response

    to

    multiple

    irrigation

    strategies,

    allowing

    the

    selection

    of

    optimal

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    for

    speciﬁc conditions (Isern et al., 2012; Belaqziz et al., 2013;

    Zaryouli et al., 2020). With the incorporation of real-time

    sensed

    variables

    describing

    plant

    response

    to

    water

    application,

    multi-agent

    systems

    have

    additionally

    been

    proposed

    for

    dynamic

    tuning

    of

    irrigation

    scheduling

    algorithms (Villarrubia et al., 2017; Wanyama and Far, 2017;

    González-Briones et al., 2019), allowing for constant adaptation

    of water supply to plant needs. Further research in incorporation

    of artiﬁcial intelligence in plant-based precision irrigation control

    could be useful in enabling further individualization of plant

    water requirement estimation, resulting in precision irrigation

    control applications that more closely meet individual plant

    needs.

    An emerging ﬁeld in precision irrigation control is the

    modeling

    of

    irrigation-related

    parameters

    using

    hybrid

    automata.

    Here,

    plant,

    soil,

    and

    atmosphere-related

    parameters are modeled using ﬁnite state-machines, with

    individual

    states

    described

    using

    simple

    linear

    models,

    enabling the modeling and control of complex dynamic

    systems, as described in Lozoya et al. (Lozoya et al., 2019) and

    Jihin et al. (Jihin et al., 2019). Future work in this area would

    involve integration of the generated plant models in precision

    irrigation control algorithms, with the aim of predicting plant

    water

    requirements

    and

    adaptively

    adjusting

    irrigation

    scheduling based on plant response.

    3.3 Advances in actuation

    Delivery of irrigation water involves control of suitable

    individual or combinations of pumps, valves, gates, and drip

    lines through connected actuators in the form of motors,

    mechanisms, and/or linkages. To ensure that the required

    amount of irrigation water is delivered in a timely manner to

    the required location, improvements at the delivery end play a

    signiﬁcant role. A common unifying factor is uniform supply of

    irrigation water, with precision control approaches mainly

    concerned with on/off switching of actuators to accomplish

    scheduling and determine irrigation quantity.

    3.3.1 Variable rate irrigation

    The achievement of precision irrigation requires variable

    delivery of water to different locations, based on localized

    requirements. The development of variable rate irrigation is

    described in Mulla and Khosla (Mulla and Khosla, 2015) as

    one of the major contributors to the widespread adoption of

    precision agriculture. In variable rate irrigation, the amount of

    water delivered by individual nozzles or groups of nozzles is

    independently adjustable, allowing for delineation of a ﬁeld into

    different irrigation management zones. This is a widely used

    approach in cases where variations in scheduling or frequency of

    irrigation for different zones within the ﬁeld may not be desired.

    Implementation of variable rate irrigation has been achieved by a

    number of researchers through modiﬁcation of commercially

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    available sprinkler irrigation systems to supply preset quantities

    of water under the control of a programmable system (McCann

    et al., 1997; Camp et al., 1998; Chávez et al., 2009) or

    development of new systems with variable rate irrigation

    capabilities (Han et al., 2009). With hardware capable of

    supplying different amounts of water, precision irrigation

    control is transformed into a zoning/mapping operation, with

    regions requiring similar quantities of irrigation water (based on

    soil properties or plant requirements) clustered together.

    Delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    has

    been

    accomplished through measurement of soil properties at

    different locations within the area under irrigation to generate

    databases that are used to determine location-speciﬁc irrigation

    settings (Hedley C. B. and Yule I. J., 2009; Chávez et al., 2009;

    Moral et al., 2010; Nahry et al., 2011; Liakos et al., 2015; Boluwade

    et al., 2016). Aggregation of on-site sensor measurements with

    satellite data to develop decision support and zone management

    systems for use in precision irrigation control is described by

    multiple researchers as well (Zhang et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011;

    De Benedetto et al., 2013a; Barker et al., 2018).

    applications. Such approaches, however, fail to respond to the

    dynamics of plant water requirements. Recent approaches

    incorporate plant-based measurements to dynamically update

    zoning maps generated from soil properties. O’Shaughnessy et al.

    use real-time plant water stress readings taken during irrigation

    events to dynamically update the zoning maps used for precision

    irrigation

    control

    (O’Shaughnessy

    et

    al.,

    2012a).

    In

    Goumopoulos et al., a wireless sensor network integrating

    measurements from soil, plant, and atmosphere is applied in

    generation of irrigation management zones and used for control

    of a wireless actuator network for precision irrigation within a

    greenhouse (Goumopoulos et al., 2014).

    3.3.2 Agricultural robots

    Introduction of robotic agents in automation of irrigation

    water delivery is an emerging area of research interest. With

    appropriate path planning and ﬁeld preparation, greater

    ﬂexibility in geographical location of irrigation heads is

    achievable, and the role of such robots is easily expandable to

    include multiple functions, such as sensing of soil and plant

    characteristics, collection of samples, and delivery of agricultural

    chemicals. Jafari et al. introduce an autonomously guided vehicle

    for relocation of sprinkler heads within an irrigated ﬁeld (Jafari

    et al., 2013). The replacement of manual labour with robotic

    actuation improves on accuracy and speed of irrigation, as well as

    minimizes wastage of water. Gealy et al. develop a hand-held

    robotic device used for ﬁne-tuning emitter settings in a modiﬁed

    drip irrigation system (Gealy et al., 2016). Water delivery can be

    set to match individual plant requirements by adjustment of ﬂow

    settings at each emitter. Thayer et al. introduce a routing

    algorithm to allow a similar robotic device for precision

    adjustment of emitter settings to operate autonomously within

    a vineyard (Thayer et al., 2018). Developments in collaborative

    robotics provide further opportunities for integration of robotic

    actuation in precision irrigation. Dusadeerungsikul et al.

    (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019) discuss the development of a

    collaborative control protocol which integrates robotic agents

    into a smart greenhouse to create a cyber-physical system that

    includes human and robotic agents. The described system

    primarily

    serves

    a

    monitoring

    and

    detection

    role

    with

    response provided by human operators. The system however

    is an indicator of the potential application of collaborative robots

    in a precision irrigation scenario, whether in sensing or actuation.

    Current research involving collaborating robotic ﬂeets,

    otherwise described as swarm robotics, is an emerging area of

    interest that could further inﬂuence future developments in

    precision irrigation control. The scalability, ﬂexibility, and

    robustness in solution of complex tasks could be employed in

    tailoring precision control decisions to allow more individually

    adapted irrigation on larger scale (Albani et al., 2017). This is

    facilitated by having specialized functions distributed among a

    larger number of robots, which can then be deployed as and when

    needed with coordinated communication (Emmi et al., 2014). Of

    particular interest are swarms composed of aerial and ground

    robots, which could integrate airborne sensing capabilities with

    ground-based application tasks, allowing real-time, closed-loop

    precision irrigation control (Grassi et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017;

    Potena et al., 2019).

    4 Challenges and opportunities

    Irrigation

    control

    has

    primarily

    been

    targeted

    at

    minimization of water consumption at the expense of yield, or

    maximization of yield at the expense of water consumption.

    Research on the effect of targeted water stress during speciﬁc

    growth periods however indicates that it is possible to achieve

    equivalent

    or

    even

    greater

    yield

    while

    reducing

    water

    consumption

    through

    strategic

    alternation

    of

    moderate

    drought stress and recovery periods (Blum et al., 1990; Cui

    et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2018). With the ongoing depletion of

    global freshwater supplies, minimization of water consumption

    will remain an overarching target of precision irrigation, with

    advancements in technology increasingly targeting more efﬁcient

    use of every applied drop of water. An emerging Frontier that

    presents interesting research questions is the individualized

    direct control of plant growth and development by targeted

    application of environmental stresses, such as is accomplished

    through deﬁcit irrigation. This has been suggested in various

    research works (Hunt and Nicholls, 1986; Kang and Wang, 2017;

    Sánchez-Blanco et al., 2019). Kögler and Söffker compare such

    targeted growth control based on precise irrigation sequencing to

    sports training (Kögler and Söffker, 2020). Development of more

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    efﬁcient precision irrigation technology and more accurate

    models representing the complex relationship between plant

    growth and irrigation water supply is necessary to achieve

    this. More direct targeting of irrigation application to the

    speciﬁc plants that require it, with quantity and timing

    selected to just avoid the region of drought stress within

    which physiological damage or yield reduction occurs, could

    result in signiﬁcant water savings and more reliable projection of

    irrigation water use throughout the growing season.

    Integration of networking and remote access into precision

    irrigation solutions has led to a new set of challenges related to

    data security. Wireless sensor networks, Internet-of-Things

    enabled devices, and cloud-based systems can be particularly

    vulnerable to cyber security threats such as distributed denial of

    service (DDoS) attacks, integration into malicious botnets

    (Antonakakis et al., 2017) and exploitation by ransomware

    creators. This creates an additional layer of considerations to

    be included in design of precision irrigation control systems.

    Legal challenges stemming from ambiguity in regulatory

    frameworks governing implementation of new technology

    could be a setback in some precision irrigation applications,

    such as those involving robotic actors and artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Progress has been made in enacting legislation to govern

    operation of unmanned aerial vehicles within the European

    Union

    (European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General

    for

    Mobility

    and

    Transport,

    2019a;

    European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, 2019b). Social

    and ethical issues stemming from implementation of artiﬁcial

    intelligence and autonomous robotic agents are also a cause of

    concern,

    with

    questions

    arising

    regarding

    data

    privacy,

    accountability in decisions involving human interaction and

    accessibility of criteria applied in decision-making (Müller,

    2020).

    Despite existing challenges, a wealth of opportunities

    abounds in precision irrigation research and implementation.

    Recent advances in high resolution remote sensing technology

    could also play an important role in precision irrigation. In

    particular, the use of satellite data to infer soil moisture is

    particularly practicable in introduction of precision irrigation

    principles in decision support systems for large scale irrigation

    platforms. Termite et al. apply machine learning techniques to

    infer soil moisture status from satellite imagery, providing crucial

    information for irrigation management at a municipality level

    (Termite et al., 2019).

    Further opportunities exist in application of cloud-based data

    storage and processing, allowing for reduction in setup and

    data storage and processing, real-time communication between

    operational costs through remote sharing of data and processing

    power. Enhanced accumulation of soil, plant, and environmental

    data facilitated by networked devices expands available agricultural

    data from which new models and control approaches can be

    generated and tested. On the actuation front, assistive technologies

    such as subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) (Roy et al.,

    2019), which uses an impermeable membrane to extend the

    duration of water availability to plants, could be integrated into

    precision irrigation scheduling approaches.

    What then, does the future hold for precision irrigation

    control? The incorporation of elements of Industry 4.0 in

    agricultural applications (also referred to as Agriculture 4.0)

    provides a guiding framework (see Figure 1). Plant-level

    sensors would give individual plants or plant monitoring units

    the ability to communicate their needs in real time. This

    information would be collected and processed in real time in

    an interconnected network of devices and agents. Artiﬁcial

    intelligence would then interpret the collected data and

    combine

    it

    with

    accurate,

    dynamic

    growth

    models

    encompassing speciﬁc scenarios with regard to exactly how

    much water should be consumed during the entire growth

    season, what yield is to be produced from each sector, by

    which

    date

    the

    crops

    should

    be

    arriving

    at

    speciﬁc

    developmental stages (including targeted harvest dates), and

    employing

    additional

    soil-speciﬁc

    and

    weather-speciﬁc

    information to tailor the prescription to each ﬁeld, growing

    season, and set of user preferences. A robust, adaptable

    controller would then generate a database containing the

    speciﬁc irrigation needs of each individual, and delivery of

    water would be implemented by opening of irrigation valves

    at the individual plant level, activated either remotely from a

    cloud-connected platform, or on site by swarms of mobile robots,

    each responsible for speciﬁc zones within the ﬁeld. After all, the

    best-placed entity to answer the question “how much water is too

    much water” is the individual plant, communicating its needs in

    real time and determining when it wishes to be watered, how

    much water it requires, and how much thirst it can take before

    compromising the ﬁnal expected yield.

    solutions to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission for automated irrigation
    systems.
  extract_1: As wireless sensor networks become more prevalent in agricultural settings,
    it is important to consider the impact of environmental factors on data transmission.
    Weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog, can attenuate or block radio
    signals, making it difficult for sensors to communicate with each other and with
    the central controller. Physical obstacles, such as trees, buildings, and hills,
    can also interfere with signal propagation.
  extract_2: To overcome the challenges of wireless data transmission in agricultural
    settings, a number of different solutions can be employed. These solutions include
    using higher-power transmitters, increasing the number of sensors, and using mesh
    networks. Higher-power transmitters can improve the range and reliability of wireless
    signals, but they can also be more expensive and power-hungry. Increasing the
    number of sensors can help to ensure that there is always a clear path between
    at least two sensors, even if some sensors are blocked by obstacles. Mesh networks
    can also be used to improve reliability by creating multiple paths for data to
    travel.

  extract_1: '"It is extremely important to instruct the agricultural production by
    knowing the crop it self’s information. The farmland system is a very complicated
    ecology system, involves different kinds of factors. Even the crop itself is a
    complicated system. The collecting of crop data usually incurs the substantial
    costs and technologies [4]. To understand the characteristic of crop information
    fully is very necessary. There are the characteristic of farmland crop information.
    A) Spatiality. The production of crop is associated with spatial factors. Every
    farmland has its own geographic location and boundaries. Spatial data is usually
    used in generating different maps as coordinates. B) Complexity. Any agricultural
    system has huge factors include not only directly related factors but also indirectly
    related factors. Each factor contains its sub-factors. Farmland crop data can
    be collected from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, handheld devices,
    remote sensing, satellite, history material, etc. Categories of data are diverse,
    including text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the information
    is changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time acquisition
    of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty
    of getting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable
    measurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data."'
  extract_2: '"Crop water information collection is the basis of precision irrigation
    decision-making. It is a key for continuously, quickly, and precisely information
    collecting. Crop water information is helpful to develop advanced and reliable
    monitoring equipment. Crop water status information collection technologies of
    crop individual include infrared temperature method, leaf water potential, spectral
    method, etc. Regional crop water status information is mainly obtained through
    remote sensing methods, including thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave
    remote sensing methods [28]. Ji Haiyan et al. [29] used near-infrared spectroscopy,
    developed a living plant leaves water testing instrument which adopts ultra-low-power
    microprocessor MSP430 and new type of optical frequency conversion chip TSL230,
    enabled field site fast non-destructive testing of crop leaf water content. Li
    Dongsheng et al. [30] developed the leaf temperature-measuring instrument, using
    infrared thermometry to measure leaf temperature to estimate leaf moisture state.
    Canopy temperature relative to ambient air temperature is often used to assess
    plant stress caused by moisture deficit or high temperature [31] [32]. Continuous

    \ massive smart devices to collect big data and carry\nout the monitoring and\
    \ control of numerous things in cyber-physical systems (CPS). By leveraging\n\
    machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze the collected\
    \ data, physical\nsystems can be monitored and controlled effectively. Along with\
    \ the development of IoT and data\nanalysis technologies, a number of CPS (smart\
    \ grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart\ncities, etc.) adopt\
    \ IoT and data analysis technologies to improve their performance and operations.\n\
    Nonetheless, directly manipulating or updating the real system has inherent risks.\
    \ Thus, creating a\ndigital clone of a real physical system, denoted as a Digital\
    \ Twin (DT), is a viable strategy. Generally\nspeaking, a DT is a data-driven\
    \ software and hardware emulation platform, which is a cyber replica\nof physical\
    \ systems. Meanwhile, a DT describes a speciﬁc physical system and tends to achieve\n\
    the functions and use cases of physical systems. Since DT is a complex digital\
    \ system, ﬁnding\na way to effectively represent a variety of things in timely\
    \ and efﬁcient manner poses numerous\nchallenges to the networking, computing,\
    \ and data analytics for IoT. Furthermore, the design of\na DT for IoT systems\
    \ must consider numerous exceptional requirements (e.g., latency, reliability,\n\
    safety, scalability, security, and privacy). To address such challenges, the thoughtful\
    \ design of DTs\noffers opportunities for novel and interdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts. To address the aforementioned\nproblems and issues, in this paper,\
    \ we ﬁrst review the architectures of DTs, data representation,\nand communication\
    \ protocols. We then review existing efforts on applying DT into IoT data-driven\n\
    smart systems, including the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities.\nFurther, we summarize the existing challenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security and\nprivacy perspectives. Finally, we outline\
    \ possible future research directions from the perspectives of\nperformance, new\

    \ (IoT) has led to a massive increase\nin the number of smart devices that are\
    \ connected to cyberspace [1–3]. In order for these\nsmart devices to make a meaningful\
    \ impact, it is important that they have the capability\nof capturing information\
    \ related to their intended use; some common information that\nwould be captured\
    \ from typical smart devices may include trafﬁc ﬂows, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and energy consumption. Depending on what a smart device is designed for,\n\
    it may capture the key characteristics of things so that the efﬁciency and intelligence\
    \ of\ncyber-physical systems (CPS), including energy, transportation, manufacturing,\
    \ agriculture,\nhealthcare, and other critical infrastructure systems, can be\
    \ realized [4–14]. Due to the\nlarge number of data points that are introduced\
    \ in these CPS, it is important to adopt\nadvanced networking, data analysis (e.g.,\
    \ deep learning), and cloud/edge computing\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64. https://doi.org/10.3390/ﬁ14020064\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n2 of\
    \ 25\ntechnologies in smart systems [15–21]. By doing this, the relevant information\
    \ can be\ncollected, transmitted, analyzed, and shared in a timely manner so that\
    \ usable information\ncan provide the intelligence to enhance the monitoring and\
    \ control abilities of physical\nsystems [22].\nAs an energy-based CPS, the smart\
    \ grid can be identiﬁed as a complex system, where\nnumerous uncertainties arise\
    \ in both cyber and physical components [23–26]. The uncer-\ntainties can be caused\
    \ by an outage in one part of the grid; in other words, the smart grid\nis susceptible\
    \ and is easily affected by random accidents such as power load imbalance,\noutages,\
    \ and even disruption from surrounding environments. We can understate both\n\
    the importance and frangibility of the smart grid, which is facing unprecedented\
    \ chal-\nlenges. Depending on the development of big data and IoT, adapting big\
    \ data analysis\ntools (ML/DL, data mining, statistics, etc.) can predict some\
    \ potential risks, in order to\nmitigate accidents in the smart grid [27]. Furthermore,\
    \ leveraging big data can establish\na virtual smart grid environment to simulate\
    \ real accidents, to investigate and develop\nmitigation plans.\nAnother example\
    \ is related to wireless sensors networks, which can be used in different\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring systems. For example, smart farming is an emerging application\n\
    that connects IoT devices so that agricultural production, soil quality, and temperature\n\
    humidity can be managed [12,28,29]. Due to the harsh weather and environments,\
    \ there are\nnumerous uncertainties that could affect the reliability of connectivity\
    \ and physical devices\nin smart farming. The uncertainties of the smart farming\
    \ system can cause failures and\nlead to the quantity and quality reduction of\
    \ agricultural products. Thus, it is necessary\nto design and implement the smart\
    \ farming system as a typical CPS in the agriculture\ndomain so that important\
    \ data can be collected and efﬁcient operations of smart farms can\nbe supported.\
    \ To this end, leveraging the collected data to create a cyber replica of the\n\
    farming system for testing and evaluation is a feasible approach to deal with\
    \ a variety of\nuncertainties in the system.\nLikewise, in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems, leveraging big data analysis can help\nsystem administrators and engineers\
    \ discover vulnerabilities in the system. In addition,\nbased on big data analysis,\
    \ system administrators and engineers can update systems\nto optimize supply chain\
    \ and production performance [7,30,31]. Nonetheless, directly\nmanipulating or\
    \ updating the real system has some critical risks. Thus, creating a cyber\nreplica\
    \ of real physical systems to emulate real cases in those physical systems is\
    \ an efﬁcient\nstrategy, which is named Digital Twin (DT).\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ DT is a digital clone of a real physical system. The vision of DT\nrefers to\
    \ data-driven software and hardware set that describes a real physical system\
    \ with all\nfunctions and use cases. It also includes all status and information\
    \ in life-cycle phases [32].\nWith obvious beneﬁts, integrating DT into CPS could\
    \ pose numerous challenges to mod-\neling, computing, networking, and data analysis,\
    \ alongside the exceptional requirements\nof CPS with respect to latency, reliability,\
    \ safety, scalability, security, and privacy, among\nothers. While advanced networking,\
    \ computing, and data analysis technologies can help\nthe realization of DT, there\
    \ are a number of issues that need to be addressed, including\nhow to deﬁne the\
    \ theoretical foundation and modeling techniques such that DT accurately\nand\
    \ reliably reﬂect the states of things, how to design ML/DL models to achieve\
    \ real-time\nbig data processing, and and how to secure DT and protect privacy-sensitive\
    \ information\ncollection and publishing.\nThere are some existing studies that\
    \ have proposed feasible approaches, such as\nleveraging multi-domain and multi-level\
    \ designs in manufacturing systems; that is, designs\nbased on different sub-system\
    \ digital abstractions in different domains, and designs based\non the principal\
    \ structures of real physical systems at different levels [33]. In order to\n\
    ensure that DT can represent the physical systems precisely, the multi-domain\
    \ and multi-\nlevel design process must accompany the life-cycle of real physical\
    \ systems. In addition,\nsome existing surveys summarize existing DT efforts that\
    \ are designed to emulate real\nphysical systems. For example, there are several\
    \ existing surveys focusing on inspecting\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n3 of\
    \ 25\nthe framework of DT in industrial systems [30,34–36]. Additionally, some\
    \ studies have\nfocused on categorizing different DTs in the power grid [37–40].\
    \ Nonetheless, since IoT is\nwidely applied to different physical systems, it\
    \ is necessary to conduct a comprehensive\ninvestigation of extending DTs to IoT-based\
    \ smart systems driven by data science and\nengineering. Furthermore, based on\
    \ new techniques, the challenges and future research\ndirections for DT need to\
    \ be discussed.\nTo address the aforementioned problems and issues, we make the\
    \ following contribu-\ntions in this study.\n•\nWe begin with the architecture\
    \ design of existing DTs, which includes DT variants,\nDT sub-types, and IoT-based\
    \ DT. We then review the data representation and com-\nmunication protocols for\
    \ DT. In addition, we present the use cases for applying DT\ninto a variety of\
    \ smart-world systems, which include smart grid, smart transportation,\nsmart\
    \ city, and smart manufacturing, as typical CPS.\n•\nBased on the architecture\
    \ and its applications to smart-world systems, we discuss chal-\nlenges that arise\
    \ from four perspectives: CPS, data science, optimization, and security\nand privacy.\
    \ We also present several research directions for DT that we strongly feel\nneed\
    \ further research, including performance, new DT-driven services, modeling and\n\
    machine learning, and security and privacy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized\
    \ as follows: In Section 2, we provide the\nhistorical background of DT, including\
    \ the key concepts, techniques, architecture, and\nprotocols of DT. In Section\
    \ 3, we review the examples of applying DT into smart-world\nsystems, including\
    \ smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart cities\nas\
    \ case study. In Section 4, we present the challenges of DT from the perspectives\
    \ of CPS,\ndata science, optimization, and security and privacy. In Section 5,\
    \ we outline possible\nfuture research directions from the perspectives of performance,\
    \ new DT-driven services,\nmodeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\
    \ Finally, we summarize the paper\nin Section 6.\n2. Digital Twin\nIn this section,\
    \ we review the basic concepts and architecture of DT, as well as data\nrepresentation\
    \ and communication protocols for enabling DT.\n2.1. Basic Concepts\nA DT system\
    \ can be regarded as a replica of a target physical system. It leverages\na model\
    \ to continuously simulate different functions of physical systems. In order to\n\
    accomplish this, the DT must have a connection with the target physical entity\
    \ so that the\nstate of physical things can be collected and updated. Thus, a\
    \ DT model can be used to\npredict, control, or optimize the functionality of\
    \ things while at the same time learning\nfrom things that it represents. Note\
    \ that the function of a DT is more than just simulation; it\ncan interact with\
    \ the physical system so that it can adapt to environmental changes.\nDT technology\
    \ relies heavily on the ability of ingesting large amounts of data and\ndrawing\
    \ conclusions on their correlation. Because of this, DT is closely tied with big\n\
    modeling driven by advanced ML/DL and big data analytic techniques so that real-time\n\
    forecasting and prediction can be achieved. For example, by leveraging DT in manufac-\n\
    turing processes, we can plan repair and maintenance activities, which could eliminate\n\
    failures from the manufacturing process. In order to obtain this seamless integration\
    \ of DT\nand physical systems, it is critical that the DT obtains the real-time\
    \ state information of\nphysical systems (i.e., sharing a connection to data);\
    \ this is realized by using IoT sensors\nand networking technologies.\nSimulation\
    \ technology has been evolving for several decades and is most commonly\nused\
    \ in Computer Aided Design (CAD), where a simulation of a system can gather insight\n\
    for a possible conclusion to a speciﬁc scenario. DT improves on this technology\
    \ by intro-\nducing ML/DL engines to interpret data that can interact with the\
    \ physical system. This\nimportant distinction between traditional simulations\
    \ and DT is made possible through\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n4 of 25\nthe\
    \ use of sensors, communication networks, data aggregation, and analysis, as well\
    \ as\ncost-effective and intelligent decision core, which can interpret the process\
    \ and provide\nreal-time feedback to the system.\n2.2. Architecture\nGenerally\
    \ speaking, DT can be divided into three parts: the physical system, the digital\n\
    system, and the connection between them. Figure 1 illustrates the general architecture\
    \ of a\nDT. The physical system represents any actual system in the real world,\
    \ including smart\ngrid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart\
    \ cities. The physical system can\nprovide service to multiple users. Nonetheless,\
    \ the environment may change when the\nphysical system operates. In this case,\
    \ the physical system needs to take action to handle\nthis change. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be difﬁcult to update a real physical model based on a\ncomplex operating\
    \ procedure. Under such a circumstance, the DT can leverage a simpliﬁed\nphysical\
    \ system and, using the data from the new environment, perform simulation and\n\
    guide the physical system to perform the next step.\nFigure 1. DT Architecture.\n\
    2.2.1. DT Variants\nBased on different types of data sharing between physical\
    \ and digital systems, we can\ncategorize DT into three variants: Digital Model,\
    \ Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin (DT).\nFigure 2 represents the architecture\
    \ of these DT variants.\nFigure 2. DT Variants.\nGenerally speaking, digital modeling\
    \ refers to a digital representation of one existing\nphysical system or its theoretical\
    \ model. The digital representation of the system may\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n5 of 25\ninclude a detailed description of the physical components. A distinct\
    \ difference is that\na true DT system would utilize the data collected from the\
    \ physical system to build a\ndigital system for simulation and control of the\
    \ physical system based on the simulation\nresults. Nonetheless, for digital models,\
    \ digital systems cannot automatically manipulate\nphysical systems based on digital\
    \ system simulation results [30,41]. Changes to the physical\nrepresentation will\
    \ not affect the digital representation and vice versa.\nTo expand on the modeling\
    \ capabilities of the digital model, the Digital Shadow\nfurther takes the simulation\
    \ and integrates a one-way data ﬂow from the physical object to\nthe digital representation\
    \ [42]. Changes to the state of the physical systems can dynamically\nalter the\
    \ representation of the digital model based on changing states in the physical\
    \ system.\nThis type of digital modeling can be used as a virtual representation\
    \ of the physical system.\nIn this way, the system administrator can intuitively\
    \ observe the operation of the physical\nsystem and can respond in time according\
    \ to the existing problems of the system. Changes\nto the physical system can\
    \ have impacts on the virtual model but not vice versa.\nThe DT is an extension\
    \ of the digital model and digital shadow. The distinct difference\nbetween the\
    \ two previous examples and a DT system is the two-way link between the\nphysical\
    \ system and the digital model. One beneﬁt of having the two-way link is the ability\n\
    to affect the physical system based on the digital representation. Changes in\
    \ the physical\nsystem can be reﬂected over the digital model so that possible\
    \ outcomes based on system\nvariables can be output. The link back to the physical\
    \ system allows the control system to\ninteract with the physical system so that\
    \ a desired outcome can be achieved.\n2.2.2. Types of DT\nIn addition to the three\
    \ variants mentioned above, the DT can be categorized into four\ntypes: DT prototype\
    \ (DTP) [43], DT instance (DTI) [44], DT aggregation (DTA) [45], and DT\nenvironment\
    \ (DTE) [44–46]. Figures 3 and 4 represent the architecture of DT types and DT\n\
    environment, respectively.\nFigure 3. DT types.\nFigure 4. DT environment.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2022, 14, 64\n6 of 25\nThe DTP represents a type of DT framework that\
    \ leverages all the information from\nthe physical system, which is necessary\
    \ to reproduce the system in the physical world.\nThe data ﬂow transfers from\
    \ the physical system to the digital system. The purpose of\nDTP is to improve\
    \ the time and cost efﬁciency of the operation of the physical system.\nDTP can\
    \ be used in monitoring systems, such as smart grid monitoring systems. However,\n\
    the DTP data ﬂow is a one-way ﬂow from the physical system to the digital system.\
    \ It can\nonly monitor the system and cannot manage it according to the incoming\
    \ data from the\nphysical system.\nThe DTI is a type of DT that connects to its\
    \ corresponding physical target. Unlike\nthe DTP, the DTI handles the data ﬂow\
    \ from the digital system to the physical system.\nThe data ﬂow contains predictions\
    \ or guidelines, which assist the physical system to\noperate simultaneously when\
    \ the environment changes. With both DTP and DTI, the two-\nway connection between\
    \ the physical system and digital system has been established.\nNonetheless, the\
    \ DTI only represents a single data ﬂow from the digital system to the\nphysical\
    \ system. In this case, another term, called DTA, has been proposed to represent\n\
    the aggregation of all the DTIs. DTI/DTA can be used to manage systems as data\
    \ ﬂows\nfrom digital systems to physical systems. The operator can operate the\
    \ physical system\naccording to the prediction result of the physical system.\
    \ Nonetheless, the DTI/DTA\ndata ﬂow cannot be transferred directly from the physical\
    \ system to the digital system.\nAdditional mechanisms need to be implemented\
    \ to retrieve information from the physical\nsystem to enable the DT to operate.\n\
    The DTE (DT environment) can be considered as the boundary of the DT application.\n\
    One DTE can contain multiple DT systems. The DTE is responsible for managing all\
    \ the\nDT systems under its coverage to assist in the operation of the relevant\
    \ physical systems.\nFrom the application point of view, DTE can be used to manage\
    \ large systems. At the\nsame time, a synchronization mechanism needs to be implemented\
    \ to speed up the query\nprocessing among multiple digital systems.\n2.2.3. Architecture\
    \ for IoT Systems\nAs massive numbers of IoT devices have been implemented across\
    \ a variety of real-\nworld applications and physical locations, and the collection,\
    \ aggregation, storage, and anal-\nysis of their generated data is a prodigious\
    \ challenge. Figure 5 illustrates a generic architec-\nture for IoT systems [47],\
    \ which consists of four layers (i.e., object layer, communication\nlayer, application\
    \ layer, and end-user layer).\nFigure 5. DT architecture for IoT.\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n7 of 25\nThe object layer represents all IoT sensors and is used\
    \ to provide data and information\nfor different IoT-driven applications. It contains\
    \ all the components that make up the\nphysical system. The communication layer\
    \ provides communication network infrastructure\nto collect IoT devices and collect\
    \ data for DT. For example, a number of edge gateways can\nbe deployed to collect\
    \ and aggregate information from sensors and send the information\nto the application\
    \ layer. IoT sensors and gateways use different communication protocols\nto collect\
    \ and transmit information. After the gateway in the object layer obtains the\n\
    information, it transmits the data to the application layer. The application layer\
    \ includes\nthe digital systems of DT. At this level, the DT system ﬁrst maps\
    \ all sensor and gateway\ninformation to the digital system. At the same time,\
    \ we can use the IoT naming service\nto name the mapped IoT sensors and local\
    \ gateways, so that the digital system can locate\ndifferent resources [48]. The\
    \ digital system can then use ML/DL models to perform\nprediction and analysis.\
    \ By doing so, the digital system can control the actuators in the\ntarget layer\
    \ based on the prediction results. Furthermore, the prediction and analysis\n\
    results can provide different services in the end-user layer. The end-user layer\
    \ provides\nservices for users, who can send requests to the application layer.\
    \ After that, the digital\nsystem will analyze the information obtained and respond\
    \ with the results accordingly.\nBased on the architecture of the DT system, data\
    \ representation and communication\nprotocols are essential for data sharing within\
    \ the DT, as well the provisioning of services\nto end users.\n2.3. Data Representation\n\
    Data representation enables components to understand data from different domains\
    \ [49–51].\nSeveral commonly used data representation protocols in DT are DT Deﬁnition\
    \ Language\n(DTDL) [52], FIWARE [53], OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC UA) [54,55],\
    \ and Feature-Based\nDT Framework (FDTF) [56]. In particular, DTDL is an open-standard\
    \ platform proposed by\nMicrosoft [52], which can realize data transmission within\
    \ the system or between different\nsystems. The summary of data representation\
    \ protocols is listed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Protocols of DTs.\nProtocol Name\n\

    \ industrial\ndevices, provides reliable data transfer, and contains built-in\n\
    checksum protection.\nURLLC\nCommunication\nAs a communication protocol, it tends\
    \ to achieve low la-\ntency and reliability in the transmission process between\n\
    IoT devices.\nDTDL [52] deﬁnes the following six characteristics of IoT components:\
    \ (i) Interface: the\nbasic information of a component (device ID, device type,\
    \ display content, etc.). Different\ninterfaces can inherit attributes from parent\
    \ interfaces (e.g., charging station components\ncan inherit some attributes of\
    \ the parking lot such as addresses); (ii) Telemetry: the data sent\nfrom any\
    \ component in the IoT-based DT (the raw data from IoT sensors, the processed\n\
    data generated by DT models, etc.); (iii) Property: the status of the components\
    \ in the\nIoT-based DT (i.e., the device is read-only or read-write). This can\
    \ also include the different\nstates between different DT (whether the data between\
    \ the two DTs are consistent, etc.); (iv)\nCommand: operations that any DT can\
    \ understand; (v) Relationship: the connection between\nthe DTs (e.g., the relationship\
    \ between the house and the cleaner is cleaned up); and (vi)\nComponent: the entities\
    \ that exist in the DT, including sensors, gateways, and digital systems.\nBased\
    \ upon these six components, DTDL can be composed of multiple DTs with a uniﬁed\n\
    structure and data, which enables seamless data transmission between different\
    \ DTs.\nFIWARE [53] is also an open-source project designed to support DT data\
    \ transmis-\nsion and the processing of contextual information received from various\
    \ IoT components.\nFIWARE developed a data modeling standard called FIWARE NGSI\
    \ that describes the\ncollection, processing, and change notiﬁcation operations\
    \ of contextual information. FI-\nWARE NGSI is an object-oriented data protocol\
    \ that uses context objects to represent\nphysical/digital objects. NGSI provides\
    \ a data model that enables data exchange between\nmultiple DTs. It also uses\
    \ NGSI-LD to represent the relationship between different objects\nand uses JSON-LD\
    \ for encoding to unify the data format.\nOPC UA [54,55] is a modeling framework\
    \ that can retrieve information from raw\ndata. OPC UA deﬁnes the data transmission\
    \ and understanding model between different\nsystems. It also has a mechanism\
    \ to traverse all data and analyze its semantics. OPC UA\nsupports data manipulation\
    \ to make it easier to manage data under the DT architecture.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ provides monitoring capabilities, enabling the DT system to manage the\nstate\
    \ of all sensors under the control.\nFDTF [56] is a DT structure that enables\
    \ the DT system to share information based on\nthe data link between DT components.\
    \ This structure realizes data sharing between digital\nsystems and physical systems,\
    \ as well as data sharing within different DT models.\n2.4. Communication Protocols\n\
    The communication protocol realizes the information transmission between IoT\n\
    devices, and between IoT systems [49–51]. There are some representative communica-\n\
    tion protocols common across IoT systems, including Constrained Application Protocol\n\
    (CoAP) [57,58], OASIS Standard Message Passing Protocol (MQTT) [59], Modbus TCP/IP\n\
    Protocol [60–64], and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [65]. The\
    \ sum-\nmary of communication protocols are listed in Table 1.\nCoAP [57,58] is\
    \ a specialized web communication protocol based on the User Data-\ngram Protocol\
    \ (UDP), tailored for resource-restricted devices (battery-powered IoT devices,\n\
    etc.). CoAP can be used to handle communication between IoT devices. It is designed\
    \ to be\ncompatible with the transmission of data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) and is\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n9 of 25\nmore compatible with Web-based\
    \ applications. CoAP can provide a publish and subscribe\nmechanism to simplify\
    \ the process of obtaining continuous data from the sensor.\nMQTT [59] is the\
    \ communication protocol based on Transmission Control Protocol\n(TCP). It is\
    \ a lightweight way for IoT devices to communicate with each other through\nMQTT\
    \ messages. These messages are lightweight due to their optimized headers, so\n\
    that the use of network resources can be reduced. The MQTT protocol includes MQTT\n\
    clients and MQTT brokers. The MQTT client can be IoT sensors, and the MQTT broker\
    \ can\nbe deployed in an IoT gateway, which is used to manage data communication\
    \ between\nsensors and control commands to IoT actuators. Since MQTT is based\
    \ on the TCP protocol,\nit can provide reliable data transfer. Furthermore, IoT\
    \ sensors may need to establish a\nconnection with the IoT gateway within a certain\
    \ period of time. In this case, with the\nhelp of MQTT brokers, IoT sensors can\
    \ establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol to\nenable transmission.\nModbus\
    \ TCP/IP [60–64] is a communication protocol used in the industrial ﬁeld to\n\
    realize the connection between industrial devices. The protocol was initially\
    \ proposed\nto provide communication between Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).\
    \ Modbus\nTCP/IP uses port 502 for data transfer. Meanwhile, the protocol contains\
    \ built-in checksum\nprotection, which can ensure the reliability of the data\
    \ transmission required in IoT systems.\nWith the aid of Modbus TCP/IP protocol,\
    \ reliable operations can be supported and applied\nto the smart grid, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and other IoT systems.\nURLLC [65] is a communication protocol that can achieve\
    \ low latency and reliability\nin the transmission process between IoT devices.\
    \ Generally speaking, URLLC is based on\nthe 5G wireless protocol, which can reduce\
    \ the delay to 0.5 ms. In order to reduce the delay,\nURLLC uses a mini-slot for\
    \ smaller time resource units, removes the scheduling mechanism\nof direct channel\
    \ access, supports asynchronous upload, and adopts dynamic scheduling\nalgorithms\
    \ such as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In order to improve reliability,\n\
    URLLC utilizes a channel estimation mechanism, a transmission diversity mechanism,\n\
    and a bit error rate reduction mechanism. With the aid of URLLC, IoT sensors can\
    \ exchange\ninformation faster and more reliably.\n3. Integrating DT in CPS\n\
    In this section, we review some existing efforts on integrating DT in different\
    \ CPS\nsuch as the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and\
    \ smart cities. DT\nin CPS is an evolving ﬁeld of research. There have been growing\
    \ research interests on\nintegrating DT in CPS. Figure 6 shows the number of recent\
    \ publications from 2018 to 2022\nfrom IEEE Xplore on the subject of DT and CPS\
    \ from four representative CPS (smart grid,\nsmart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities). The included papers are\nrelated to both DT system and CPS\
    \ system in the content or in the experiment.\nFigure 6. Number of publications\
    \ related to DT and CPS in IEEE Xplore.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n10 of 25\n\
    3.1. Framework\nFigure 7 describes an architecture option of a DT-driven smart-world\
    \ system motivated\nby the existing efforts on DT [33]. The architecture consists\
    \ of three main components:\nthe physical subsystem, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) model, and the DT model. The IoT\ngateway from each physical system collects\
    \ and aggregates the data from the physical\nsystem. With the support of communication\
    \ protocols, data can be transmitted from the\nphysical system to the AI model.\
    \ The AI model is used for data analysis and model design\nbased on the states\
    \ of physical system. Then, the AI model stores its trained model as a\nDT model\
    \ to represent the digital perspective of physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of\nphysical system does not change, the DT model can guide the physical system\
    \ to react\nbased on the data collected by physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of physical system\nchanges or needs to respond differently to the same situation,\
    \ the AI model can update its\nmodel according to the changes of physical system\
    \ and revise the DT model to further assist\nthe operations of physical system.\
    \ Recall that DT can assist in the control and operation of\nphysical systems\
    \ [34].\nFigure 7. DT-based CPS.\n3.2. Smart Grid\nAs a key energy infrastructure,\
    \ the smart grid leverages information communication\ntechnology (i.e., cyber\
    \ system) to provide two-way communication (of both energy and\ninformation) so\
    \ that the monitoring and control of the grid can be improved and consumers\n\
    can be engaged. The physical infrastructure of the power grid is composed of power\
    \ gener-\nation facilities, transmission facilities, and power distribution facilities.\
    \ Power generation\nfacilities are responsible for generating electricity, while\
    \ transmission facilities are used\nto deliver power to distribution facilities.\
    \ Finally, power distribution facilities provide\nelectricity to consumers.\n\
    With the integration of the cyber system, the next-generation power grid, denoted\n\
    as the smart grid, has been envisioned to provide more efﬁcient energy service\
    \ for users,\nincluding reliable and intelligent distribution management, renewable\
    \ energy integration,\nenergy storage, grid monitoring and control, and the integration\
    \ of electric vehicles into\nthe grid [5]. Generally speaking, the smart grid\
    \ is a highly distributed grid system, which\nintegrates information communication\
    \ techniques, including sensing, networking commu-\nnications, data analytics,\
    \ and machine learning [66,67]. These technologies can improve the\nreliability,\
    \ efﬁciency, and security resilience of the grid system.\nThe smart grid system\
    \ is a large-scale distributed system. To improve the monitor\nand control of\
    \ the grid, it is critical to know the states of physical objects (voltage, current,\n\
    etc.) in the system. To do so, a massive quantity of sensors can be deployed in\
    \ the grid\nto measure the state of critical objects and derive the accurate and\
    \ insightful knowledge\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n11 of 25\nof physical objects\
    \ based on measurements. In the past, both static and dynamic state\nestimation\
    \ have been applied to the monitoring and control of the grid, and bad data\n\
    detection algorithms have also been designed to deal with corrupted, invalid measurement,\n\
    and/or malicious injection data, which can be generated via measurement error,\
    \ sensor\nfailure, or even cyber threats [24,25]. Note that in addition to potential\
    \ failures in the grid,\ncyber threats can directly or indirectly affect the grid’s\
    \ operations by injecting malicious\nmeasurement data and/or manipulating the\
    \ critical control information to the actuator.\nTo handle cyber threats, it is\
    \ critical to not only monitor the state of physical objects but also\nmonitor\
    \ the state of cyber components. In this regard, the DT can be a viable approach\
    \ to\nlink the objects in the physical world to the cyber world.\nDT uses a data-driven\
    \ modeling strategy to map the physical grid to the digital grid\nso that monitoring\
    \ and management operations for the entire grid can be enabled. Based\non the\
    \ DT architecture that we have discussed, the smart grid system can be divided\
    \ into\nseveral layers: object layer, communication layer, application layer,\
    \ and end-user layer.\nIn the object layer, grid components include power generation\
    \ facilities, transmission\nfacilities, and power distribution facilities. The\
    \ communication layer is responsible for\nthe communication to connect objects,\
    \ supporting data exchange between the objects and\nthe application layer, and\
    \ the data communication within the object layer. For example,\nthe gateway of\
    \ the communication layer contains the device information of object layer.\nWhen\
    \ the application layer needs data, the gateway can retrieve the data from a speciﬁc\n\
    device as required. The application layer can also construct a digital model based\
    \ on the\ndevice distribution information from the gateway.\nThe application layer\
    \ includes a digital representation of the gateways from the phys-\nical system,\
    \ which contains device information from the object layer; it communicates\nbetween\
    \ the application layer and the object layer through the communication layer.\
    \ In the\napplication layer, the AI model is trained based on the data collected\
    \ from the object layer,\nand the trained model is stored in the data storage\
    \ for future use. If the physical state of the\nobject layer changes, the application\
    \ layer can send commands to some actuators in the ob-\nject layer to control\
    \ the grid based on the current data and the trained model. If the physical\n\
    components of the object layer change, the AI model can perform model updates\
    \ to reﬂect\nthe changes as well. The end user layer uses the information processed\
    \ by the application\nlayer to provide services for end users, including smart\
    \ grid management systems, smart\ncharging systems for autonomous vehicles, and\
    \ hybrid energy management systems.\nThere are a number of research efforts on\
    \ DT for the smart grid [38,39,68–71]. For\nexample, General Electric (GE) proposed\
    \ two models related to the use of DT in wind\nfarms [68,69]. In the object layer,\
    \ a communication network was designed to enable\nwind turbines to communicate\
    \ with each other. A wind turbine control system was also\nimplemented to control\
    \ one or more wind turbines. The middleware layer includes a cloud-\nbased infrastructure\
    \ with the support of the communication network so that the data (e.g.,\nstate\
    \ of turbines) can be collected and turbines can be remotely controlled via gateways.\
    \ It\nalso includes digital models that represent digital replicas of wind turbines.\
    \ The digital\nmodel can be updated based on the information extracted from the\
    \ object layer, and the\nwind farm can be controlled through an industrial gateway.\
    \ In addition, GE designed a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) in the application\
    \ layer to show the digital representation of\nthe wind farm and perform the control\
    \ and management operations of the wind farm.\nAhmed et al. [39] proposed a microgrid\
    \ DT model based on the IoT to mitigate cyber\nattacks. The object includes microgrid,\
    \ local controller, and area controller. Real-time\nbalancing algorithms were\
    \ implemented in each controller. If some microgrids are attacked\nand go ofﬂine,\
    \ the area controller can obtain information, and the balancing algorithm will\n\
    not transfer more power to the ofﬂine area based on the tampered data. This architecture\n\
    can also mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and false injection\
    \ attacks.\nLikewise, Nikolaos et al. [38] used DT to manage a large number of\
    \ devices in the smart\ngrid system. To be speciﬁc, they used the spike neural\
    \ network (SNN) deployed on\nthe smart meter in the grid to detect fault nodes.\
    \ A transient state estimator (TSE) was\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n12 of 25\n\
    designed to reveal the dynamic state of the smart grid. William et al. [70] leveraged\
    \ deep\nlearning algorithms to analyze data from the supervisory control and data\
    \ acquisition\nsystem (SCADA) to assist the DT in detecting physical faults in\
    \ the smart grid system.\nLikewise, Payam et al. [71] proposed a DT framework\
    \ with artiﬁcial neural networks\n(ANN) for distributed smart grids to ensure\
    \ real-time model generation, veriﬁcation,\nand identiﬁcation.\n3.3. Smart Transportation\n\
    The smart transportation system can be regarded as a CPS, which provides a va-\n\
    riety of services for the transportation domain, including trafﬁc management control.\n\
    Some applications in smart transportation systems include toll payment, vehicle\
    \ operation,\nemergency, vehicle control and safety management, and maintenance\
    \ and construction\nmanagement [6,72,73]. Since the smart transportation system\
    \ requires real-time data trans-\nmission and analysis capabilities to implement\
    \ time-sensitive services such as autonomous\nvehicles, it is difﬁcult for traditional\
    \ models to complete model training under massive\ndata within a short time. It\
    \ is additionally challenging for traditional smart transportation\nsystems to\
    \ complete the collection and aggregation of all sensor data within a short time.\n\
    In this case, the DT model can use high performance cloud/edge servers in the\
    \ digital\nsystem to conduct data aggregation and model training so that real-time\
    \ processing and\ntransmission can be achieved.\nBased on the architecture of\
    \ the DT that we have discussed, DT in the transportation\nsystem consists of\
    \ four layers. The object layer contains the components of the infrastructure\n\
    and participants (e.g., drivers), including sensors on the vehicle, trafﬁc cameras,\
    \ and other\ntrafﬁc sensors. The communication layer uses a variety of gateways\
    \ to process sensor data\nfrom the object layer, and handle data transmission\
    \ between the object and application\nlayers. The application layer maps the gateway\
    \ from the communication layer to realize\ndata transmission between the communication\
    \ layer and the application layer. Based on\nthe data and sensor information from\
    \ the gateway, the DT can use ML/DL technology\nto train the model and store it\
    \ in data storage. The end-user layer can navigate based\non the data processed\
    \ by the application layer, assist the driving of autonomous vehicles,\nand cooperate\
    \ with smart cities and smart grids to reduce transportation costs, reduce\nenergy\
    \ consumption, and make the charging process of electric vehicles more efﬁcient.\n\
    There have been some research efforts on DT-driven smart transportation. For example,\n\
    Peter et al. [74] proposed a scheme for DT-driven smart transportation that attempts\
    \ to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂows in urban areas. The proposed smart transportation system\
    \ includes an\nAI model, a digital replica of the road network, and various trafﬁc\
    \ control and management\nservices. The system obtains data from the object layer,\
    \ including trafﬁc lights, sensors,\nand cameras. After the smart transportation\
    \ system processes the data, it will build an\napplication at the end-user layer\
    \ based on the collected data, which is called the city service\ninformation system.\
    \ Then, operators can manage the entire system at a high level based on\nthe end\
    \ user’s application. Additionally, Sagar et al. [75] proposed a DT-based adaptive\n\
    trafﬁc signal control (ATSC) to reduce the waiting time at intersections, thereby\
    \ improving\nthe driver’s driving experience. In that study, the Urban Trafﬁc\
    \ Simulation (SUMO) was\nused as the simulation platform.\nAdditionally, Wang\
    \ et al. [76] designed a DT-based veriﬁcation platform to perform\nveriﬁcation\
    \ between different metro systems. The object domain includes operation center;\n\
    trackside and train information is collected, and data is transmitted to the DT\
    \ system of the\napplication layer through various communication protocols, including\
    \ 4G, 5G, Ethernet,\nand NB-IoT. The DT platform uses ML/DL, data fusion, and\
    \ data modeling to analyze all\ndata and assist the end-user level in scheduling,\
    \ train monitoring, pedestrian monitoring,\netc. Sahal et al. [77] proposed a\
    \ DT structure combined with blockchain to enable DT-\nbased intelligent transportation\
    \ systems to achieve interoperability, identity veriﬁcation,\ndistributed ML/decision-making,\
    \ and scalability and robustness. Likewise, Guo et al. [78]\ndemonstrated a DT-based\
    \ 3D collaborative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) to visualize\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n13 of 25\nreal-time road data and use LIDAR as road sensors. They\
    \ used the ROS bridge as a\ncommunication protocol to communicate between the\
    \ physical and virtual worlds.\n3.4. Smart Manufacturing\nThe smart manufacturing\
    \ system, as a general concept, is the integration of traditional\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems and processes with information communication technologies to\nenable\
    \ advanced intelligence and process optimization and automation. The demands\n\
    of current manufacturing systems can be complex in nature, due to the challenges\
    \ of\nscalability, efﬁciency, delivery, or design requirements [79]. The smart\
    \ manufacturing\nsystem is the utilization of emerging technologies to massively\
    \ optimize production in\nterms of throughput, efﬁciency, precision, loss, resource\
    \ consumption, scale, and value [7].\nTraditional manufacturing systems are comprised\
    \ of shop ﬂoor hardware that works\nas a unit to streamline the production of\
    \ a deliverable product. In contrast, the smart\nmanufacturing system integrates\
    \ communication and computing technologies to utilize\ninformation generated from\
    \ traditional manufacturing systems to make a more complete\nrepresentation of\
    \ a product life cycle. The application of IoT to industrial systems, or Indus-\n\
    try 4.0, relies on technologies such as sensing, control, communication, computing,\
    \ and data\nscience to support information ﬂows between different components of\
    \ the manufacturing\nsystem, allowing for better system interoperability and use.\n\
    One major limitation in manufacturing systems is the ability to automate and mass\n\
    produce in a manner that is efﬁcient and cost-effective. With the shifting paradigm\
    \ in\nmanufacturing of custom user deliverables, there is an increased challenge\
    \ to provide\ncustom solutions in a method that can be massively produced by manufacturing\
    \ systems.\nA common issue in manufacturing is the ability to generate a deliverable\
    \ that is ﬂexible to\nthe user’s needs while still maintaining automated systems\
    \ that can quickly and efﬁciently\ncreate products. At scale, it is often difﬁcult\
    \ to analyze how changing requirements in\nthe product design or supply chain\
    \ will impact variables such as cost and production\ntimelines while retaining\
    \ quality and efﬁciency. Additionally, adoption rates are going\nto be a challenge\
    \ for manufacturing environments that are looking to incorporate smart\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems in their product life-cycle. A core technology for enabling smart\n\
    manufacturing is the availability of information from the physical objects (i.e.,\
    \ shop ﬂoor\nequipment) through IoT sensors connected to IoT networking infrastructure.\n\
    Implementation of DT in the smart manufacturing system can help evaluate the\n\
    effectiveness of large-scale production environments by utilizing models for analyzing\n\
    production efﬁciency and design factors. The link between the virtual and physical\
    \ rep-\nresentation of a manufacturing system (i.e., in the way of DT) can determine\
    \ whether a\ndesign is going to be cost-effective by integrating with decision\
    \ support systems such as\nsupply chain management and timeline forecasts. The\
    \ integration of smart supply chain\ntechnologies involves a real-time link between\
    \ the production environment and the sup-\npliers and distribution centers to\
    \ determine the deliverable dates [80]. Determining the\navailability of materials\
    \ required for manufacturing production will allow the system to\ngenerate a cost\
    \ model and timeline for delivering a ﬁnal product.\nMonitoring the physical production\
    \ environment with DT systems can allow for the\nreal-time analysis of system\
    \ health on physical things (i.e., equipment, tools, and hardware)\nand prevent\
    \ delays based on environmental factors. In the event of an anomaly detection\n\
    on a manufacturing system, the DT model can determine whether the work load should\
    \ be\nrerouted to another system in the manufacturing line to avoid delays in\
    \ production [81].\nIoT sensors in manufacturing equipment allow for real-time\
    \ monitoring, enabling the de-\ntection of events that could cause breakdowns\
    \ in the manufacturing system and providing\nalternative scenarios for maintaining\
    \ system efﬁciency to prevent delays in production\ntimelines [82].\nSince smart\
    \ manufacturing can apply to many different levels of technologies in\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems, it is important to consider the level of adoption for technologies\
    \ in\nIndustry 4.0 scenarios. For example, Frank et al. [80] analyzed different\
    \ levels of adoption\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n14 of 25\nin several different\
    \ manufacturing domains and concluded that the implementation of\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ technologies is interrelated and provides potential beneﬁts when more systems\n\
    are integrated with smart manufacturing processes. Additionally, the utilization\
    \ of both\nfront-end technologies and base technologies could provide more complete\
    \ integration\nbetween physical systems and virtual representations that can better\
    \ handle the challenges\nof requirement complexity and decision support systems.\n\
    With the support from the communication layer and techniques to enable data aggre-\n\
    gation, DT implementation can help with the following scenarios in a smart manufacturing\n\
    system. The ﬁrst scenario is the detection of fault tolerance and device health,\
    \ which can\nhelp smart manufacturing systems to avoid outages by predicting device\
    \ failures and\nrerouting workﬂows in the production process. In particular, cloud-based\
    \ frameworks\nthat are designed to handle large amounts of data utilize embedded\
    \ sensor systems in\nmanufacturing devices in order to monitor system health,\
    \ leading to the creation of pre-\ndictive models for avoidance procedures [83].\
    \ In the example of a robotic gripper in a\nmanufacturing production line, Redelinghuys\
    \ et al. [82] investigated anomaly detection in\nthe gripper closing speed for\
    \ detecting via pressure sensor to detect faults and degradation\nthat could lead\
    \ to failure and considered utilizing the result to reroute production trafﬁc\
    \ to\nanother assembly line. This type of fault detection compares recent samples\
    \ to historical\ndata and builds a model that determines when a device is likely\
    \ to fail in a production\nenvironment, enabling the automated scheduling of preventative\
    \ maintenance.\nThe second scenario is supporting supply chain management, which\
    \ involves the\nintegration of DT systems and the communication of real-time data\
    \ between suppliers and\ndistribution centers. The tracking of products can be\
    \ integrated into the supplier systems to\ninform the manufacturer system and\
    \ can be integrated with the customer-facing deliverable\nto accurately determine\
    \ product delivery timelines and end-to-end supply chain logistics.\nThe tracking\
    \ of goods required for a customer deliverable can be remotely monitored and\n\
    integrated between supplier and manufacturer systems to determine the availability\
    \ of\ngoods required to produce a product [84]. In the event that a good required\
    \ for a custom\ndeliverable is not available, the decision support system can\
    \ determine whether there is a\nmore suitable supplier for the product and whether\
    \ it would be cost-efﬁcient to utilize a\ndifferent supplier. By generating a\
    \ pricing and timeline model for the availability of goods,\nthe manufacturer\
    \ can determine whether the product is worth producing and provide an\naccurate\
    \ cost analysis to the customer.\nNote that one of the emerging challenges of\
    \ manufacturing systems is the ability to\ncreate highly customized products in\
    \ a manner that is efﬁcient. Manufacturing in general is\noften focused on the\
    \ mass production of a good or product in order to decrease the cost and\neffort\
    \ required per unit. This type of mass production is often associated with processes\n\
    that are easily automated to speed up the production time. With the shifting paradigm\n\
    of manufacturing trending towards more customized deliverables [85], product variety\n\
    becomes a factor when designing production systems that will maintain efﬁciency\
    \ while\nstill meeting diverse customer requirements. Integration with DT systems\
    \ can allow for\nthe application of ML/DL algorithms and modeling technologies\
    \ to determine whether a\ncustom deliverable requirement is feasible in a given\
    \ manufacturing system. Manufacturing\nsystems need to be both ﬂexible and efﬁcient\
    \ in order to be useful for custom deliverable\nobjectives [86].\nThere are some\
    \ existing research efforts on the evolution of smart manufacturing\nconcepts\
    \ and the best way to apply DT technologies for more robust manufacturing sys-\n\
    tems [30,86–88]. For example, Lu et al. [86] reviewed the standards utilized in\
    \ smart\nmanufacturing systems, applied their research toward the production of\
    \ new standards,\nand further envisioned scenarios for smart manufacturing systems,\
    \ some of which can\nbeneﬁt from the application of DT systems. Kritzinger et\
    \ al. [30] took the application of\nsmart manufacturing one step further by studying\
    \ the application of DT as an enabling\ntechnology for Industry 4.0. Likewise,\
    \ Brennet et al. [87] discussed the convergence of digi-\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n15 of 25\ntal and physical systems for Industry 4.0 through the application\
    \ of Personalized Product\nEmergence Processes (PPEP) and additive manufacturing\
    \ technologies.\nFurthermore, the implementation of DT in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems was inves-\ntigated [81,89,90]. For example, Tao et al. [89] summarized\
    \ the deployment structure of\nDT for smart manufacturing based on the concept\
    \ of DT Workshop, which enables digital\nsystems and physical systems to synchronize\
    \ with one another. In this case, the digital\nsystem can be virtualized based\
    \ on data from the physical system, and the physical system\ncan be optimized\
    \ based on the instructions from the digital system. In order to better\nexplain\
    \ how to deploy Digital Twin Shop-Floor (DTS), DTS was divided into four parts:\n\
    physical shop-ﬂoor, virtual shop-ﬂoor, shop-ﬂoor service system, and shop-ﬂoor\
    \ DT. Like-\nwise, Kamil et al. [90] implemented a DT in an experimental assembly\
    \ quality production\ninspection system. In particular, they used radio-frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation (RFID) and cam-\neras in the physical system and used a programmable\
    \ logic controller (PLC) system to\ncollect data. The OPC UA framework was considered\
    \ to transfer data between the physical\nsystem and the digital system. The digital\
    \ model consists of a 3D model created in CAD\ndesign software and is simulated\
    \ and virtualized using the Tecnomatix platform. The cloud\nplatform was integrated\
    \ into the digital system for data analysis so that the assembly\nquality inspection\
    \ could be realized without stopping the manufacturing process. Open-\nsource\
    \ technology can also beneﬁt the development of applying DT in smart manufacturing\n\
    scenarios. For example, Aghenta et al. [91] proposed a low-cost IoT-based SCADA\
    \ system\nsolution. In addition to providing the basic functions of a traditional\
    \ SCADA system, this\nparticular system can not only support data acquisition,\
    \ transmission, and presentation\nbut also the monitoring and control of physical\
    \ objects.\n3.5. Smart Cities\nThe objective of the smart city is to leverage\
    \ information communication and data-\nrelated technologies so that resources\
    \ can be efﬁciently used, leading to better quality of\nlife, reduction of resource\
    \ input, etc. So far, the majority of focus has been on government\nand energy\
    \ initiatives, followed by transportation, building, and water, among other goals.\n\
    A number of research and development efforts on smart cities and DT applications\
    \ have\nbeen generated [92–96]. Similar to smart manufacturing, smart cities are\
    \ the combination\nof a wide range of IoT domains to address the complex challenges\
    \ in cities and must\nincorporate cloud/edge computing with big data collection\
    \ and analysis as essential\ntechniques to drive the realization of efﬁciency\
    \ and optimization [11,97].\nIt should be noted that the development of the smart\
    \ city has involved several op-\nportunities and challenges: (i) people’s expectations\
    \ are constantly changing. How can\npeople’s expectations be accounted for when\
    \ they are frequently and forever changing,\neven when real-time communication\
    \ is a reality? How can the change in expectation be\nevaluated? (ii) How can\
    \ the latest technologies be utilized to improve the efﬁciency of\nour government?\
    \ How can we forecast outcomes and avoid potential losses or mistakes?\nHow can\
    \ we mitigate the risks? These questions have become the urgent issues that a\n\
    government must consider with respect to smart cities. Similar to numerous practices\n\
    in smart manufacturing, in smart cities, we could leverage DT to detect and address\
    \ a\nproblem before it arises, reducing cost, rather than attempting to solve\
    \ a problem after it\nhas occurred. If the results from the DT match the expectation,\
    \ data can be transferred to\nreal physical objects to implement the changes in\
    \ a fast and seamless way.\nSome efforts toward integrating DT with smart cities\
    \ have already been made [98–103].\nFor example, Deng et al. [98] reviewed some\
    \ key technologies in Digital Twin City (DTCs),\nsuch as surveying and mapping,\
    \ building information model, IoT, next-generation wireless\nnetworking, and blockchain.\
    \ Shahat et al. [99] reviewed some challenges of DT cities and\ndiscussed some\
    \ research that leveraged DT into smart cities. Note that while the city DT\n\
    cannot provide solutions for addressing problems in cities, DT can provide beneﬁts\
    \ in\nseveral areas. In order to demonstrate the performance of DT, it is necessary\
    \ to conduct\nresearch on data collection, data management, the utilization of\
    \ big data, virtual reality\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n16 of 25\n(VR), IoT,\
    \ and 3D Modeling. Likewise, Shirowzhan et al. [100] discussed technologies\n\
    that can be useful for enabling smarter cities. They identiﬁed trends in geospatial\
    \ science,\nparticularly in the application of geographic information system (GIS),\
    \ and observed the\nimpacts of newly developed online applications such as ArcGIS\
    \ Urban.\nMore and more smart cities around the world are embracing DT to replicate\
    \ its\nperformance and response to changes. By the year 2020, 118 cities were\
    \ using DT in Smart\nCity projects and systems. Cities are also using DT to reduce\
    \ carbon dioxide emissions and\nmanage trafﬁc efﬁciently. According to ABI Research,\
    \ DT could assist cities in carrying out\ncost-effective urban resource planning\
    \ [104]. We believe that DT has the potential to further\nimprove upon the already\
    \ signiﬁcant gains that it has achieved.\n4. Challenges\nIntegrating DT into CPS\
    \ can not only improve the efﬁcient operation of CPS through\nincreased intelligence,\
    \ it can also assist CPS in providing more valuable service to end-\nusers. Recall\
    \ that as DT is a digital replicate of physical things, it is critical to make\
    \ DT\ncapable of representing a variety of things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient\
    \ manner.\nThe realization of such a DT raises numerous challenges to the networking,\
    \ computing,\ncontrol, and data analysis of IoT. Furthermore, the design of DT\
    \ shall consider the numerous\nexceptional requirements of CPS (e.g., latency,\
    \ reliability, safety, scalability, security, and\nprivacy). To address such challenges,\
    \ designing DT offers opportunities for novel and\ninterdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts.\n4.1. CPS Challenges\nAs a complex system that requires the coordination\
    \ of network, computing, and con-\ntrol, CPS has strict performance requirements\
    \ in different application scenarios. Generally\nspeaking, CPS applications require\
    \ very low latency, high reliability, and large scalability.\nTaking the smart\
    \ transportation system as an example, suppose we are designing applica-\ntions\
    \ related to autonomous driving. Vehicles need to be able to quickly collect pertinent\n\
    information. This information includes data collected by sensors, transmitted\
    \ through the\nInternet of Vehicles, and so on. Then, the vehicle needs to process\
    \ this data quickly, extract\nusable information, and control the vehicle according\
    \ to the determined situation at the\ntime. Since vehicle driving is closely related\
    \ to personal safety, there is no doubt that the\nreliability of autonomous driving\
    \ is our primary consideration. The issues that we need to\nconsider include network\
    \ failures, computing hardware failures, and many more.\nMoreover, because the\
    \ number of vehicles in each scenario will be different, we need\nto ensure the\
    \ scalability of the autonomous driving application that we design to handle\n\
    the problems caused by the large number of vehicles, such as network congestion\
    \ and high\ncontrol algorithm complexity. From this example, we can conclude that\
    \ the performance\nrequirements of CPS are very strict. The overall performance\
    \ of CPS is the result of multiple\nsubsystem (network, computing, and control)\
    \ interactions and is synthesized within the\nCPS. This interaction means that\
    \ any slight change in the performance of any one subsystem\ncan have a compounding\
    \ effect on the performance of other subsystems, thereby causing a\ncomplex impact\
    \ on the performance of the entire CPS system. Thus, when building a DT\nfor CPS,\
    \ it is challenging to not only meet all these strict performance requirements\
    \ but also\nto reﬂect the interactions between the various subsystems in a timely\
    \ manner.\n4.2. Data Science Challenges\nBuilding the DT of a complex system itself\
    \ is very challenging, involving mathematical\nmodeling and data analysis. There\
    \ are two major approaches to building an accurate DT:\nmodel-driven and data-driven.\
    \ When we adopt the model-driven approach, we use\nmathematical models to represent\
    \ physical systems. Therefore, knowing how to build\na mathematical model that\
    \ accurately represents a complex physical system in CPS is a\nchallenging problem.\
    \ Since there are many variables involved in the physical system of\nCPS, the\
    \ mathematical model will be signiﬁcantly complicated, typically with properties\n\
    Future Internet 2022, 14, 64\n17 of 25\nsuch as non-linearity, highly-coupled,\
    \ and time-variance. When we adopt a data-driven\napproach, we collect massive\
    \ amounts of data from the physical system that reﬂects its\nstatus over time.\
    \ The process of collecting and selecting these data poses some challenges.\n\
    First of all, in CPS, one type of data may be collected from multiple sources,\
    \ and the\nhardware conditions of these sources will be different, such that it\
    \ is difﬁcult to ensure that\nthe quality of all data is the same. Second, the\
    \ storage and transmission of this massive\namount of data creates signiﬁcant\
    \ overhead to the system. In order to truly reﬂect the\ntimely updates of the\
    \ physical system, we often sample the state of the physical system\nat a very\
    \ high frequency, and these data require considerable storage space and pose\n\
    signiﬁcant overhead for networking and computing infrastructures with strict performance\n\
    requirements. Therefore, one fundamental data science problem is how to collect\
    \ the\nleast amount of data without signiﬁcantly and negatively impacting the\
    \ efﬁcacy of DT.\nIn conclusion, how to effectively construct a DT for the complex\
    \ system with the least\namount of data is a challenging problem that needs to\
    \ consider both mathematical modeling\nand data science aspects.\n4.3. Optimization\
    \ Challenges\nRealizing a DT in CPS that accounts for the interactions of computing,\
    \ control, commu-\nnication, and data analysis modules in an end-to-end chain\
    \ is challenging. The communica-\ntion resource allocation algorithms, such as\
    \ time and frequency resource scheduling, are\nvery complex, especially when combined\
    \ with massively distributed networking devices\nand low latency requirements.\
    \ In addition, the computing resource allocation, such as\ntask-ofﬂoading in an\
    \ edge/cloud computing architecture, is another optimization problem\nwith stringent\
    \ performance constraints. Furthermore, the control mechanism, possibly\nevent-triggered\
    \ or time-triggered control, or both, yields still another optimization prob-\n\
    lem. In addition, analysis of the collected data is highly complex, requiring\
    \ prodigious\nfeature extraction, and training (or at least validation), coupled\
    \ with potentially continual\nprediction or classiﬁcation to satisfy real-time\
    \ requirements.\nThe DT is a combination of the real-time computing, real-time\
    \ control, and real-time\ncommunication, which generates the joint/integrated\
    \ optimization problem of computing,\ncontrol, and communication. Consider VR-supported\
    \ smart manufacturing as an example.\nFirst, we need to deliver massive amounts\
    \ of sensing data with required latency. Then,\nwe need to use the graphics engine\
    \ to generate the digital model in real time. Finally, we\nneed to execute the\
    \ control command within the latency constraint. Since any problem in\nthis chain\
    \ will directly affect the performance of the other, even in a centralized system\n\
    with superior hardware conditions, it is very challenging to perform joint optimization\n\
    on this VR system. Further, the distributed system of CPS only makes the problem\
    \ of\njoint optimization much harder. For example, in our previous work [105],\
    \ we adopted\ndeep reinforcement learning to help conﬁgure the network and dynamically\
    \ change the\nsensor sampling rate at the same time to improve the control performance\
    \ of a distributed\nsmart manufacturing system. However, by introducing DT to\
    \ the CPS, there are more\nprocesses that need to be considered. For example,\
    \ in the control process, there are two\nprocesses, such as the domain expert\
    \ controlling DT and DT controlling the physical objects.\nThe computing of DT\
    \ in CPS needs to consider three computing processes, such as the\ncomputing process\
    \ of generating a digital copy of a physical object, the computing process\nof\
    \ the interaction between DTs in a simulated scenario, and the computing process\
    \ of actual\nCPS tasks. The communication of DT in CPS needs to consider the communication\
    \ between\nthe physical object and the virtual clone, the communication between\
    \ the DT and other\nDTs, and the communication between the DT and the human control\
    \ interface. These extra\nprocesses make the optimization problem more difﬁcult\
    \ to solve.\nTaking into account the limited resources of the CPS system, we also\
    \ need to optimize\nthe large amount of data generated in these processes from\
    \ the perspective of data gen-\neration, data storage, and data transmission.\
    \ From a data generation perspective, when\nwe generate the data needed to build\
    \ a DT in CPS, the quality of the data is a major issue.\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n18 of 25\nBecause we need to deploy a massive number of CPS devices,\
    \ the hardware conditions of a\nsingle CPS device are often very limited. In addition,\
    \ in the CPS environment, one type\nof data may be collected by multiple sources.\
    \ Thus, how to effectively select data sources\nfor different CPS applications\
    \ is a challenging problem. From a data storage perspective,\nwhen we are building\
    \ the DT, in order to truly reﬂect the timely update of physical objects,\nwe\
    \ often sample the state of physical objects at a relatively high frequency. Inevitably,\n\
    an incredible volume of data will be collected on the DT server side. On one hand,\
    \ these\ndata can be used to assist in the development of other DT systems; on\
    \ the other hand, these\ndata take up signiﬁcant storage space. Because there\
    \ is not a simple linear relationship\nbetween the amount of stored data and the\
    \ performance of the DT system, the question of\nhow to accurately select useful\
    \ data for storage has always been difﬁcult to answer. From a\ndata transmission\
    \ perspective, due to the heterogeneity of CPS systems, IoT/CPS devices\nuse different\
    \ communication technologies. When we need to transmit data between these\ndevices,\
    \ we usually deploy a gateway with various radio interfaces for data exchange.\
    \ This\nsolution will bring additional hardware costs and potential network bottlenecks.\
    \ Con-\nsidering that the DT system has very strict requirements on timing and\
    \ latency, it is very\nchallenging to design networking infrastructure to support\
    \ real-time communications so\nthat the information between different components\
    \ can be delivered quickly and efﬁciently.\n4.4. Security and Privacy Challenges\n\
    We now discuss the security and privacy challenges. Since DT needs to update the\n\
    state of physical objects in real time through network communications, DT will\
    \ be subject\nto cyber attacks, such as integrity attacks on physical hardware\
    \ and sensors, transmission,\nand digital systems. Taking the data integrity attack\
    \ as an example, the adversary can\ndirectly attack IoT devices as data collectors,\
    \ causing them to upload invalid/misleading\ndata. Alternatively, an adversary\
    \ can attack the gateway, to which the IoT device uploads\ndata, mixing the invalid/misleading\
    \ data with the correct data collected by IoT devices.\nFinally, the adversary\
    \ could directly inject false data into the DT. Because the DT and\nphysical objects\
    \ are closely connected, any one of these attacks will yield a signiﬁcant\nimpact\
    \ on the integrity of the entire system.\nAdditionally, from the perspective of\
    \ conﬁdentiality, the DT applications contain\na large amount of privacy-sensitive\
    \ information, such as medical records, autonomous\nvehicle sensing information,\
    \ and real-time smart grid operation information. Therefore,\nit is not only necessary\
    \ to implement an authentication mechanism for physical objects\nbut also an authentication\
    \ mechanism for digital communication and machine-to-machine\ntransmission. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be costly to implement authentication mechanisms on\nlow-energy IoT devices.\
    \ In this case, knowing how to handle the authentication process\non devices with\
    \ limited power has become a challenge. From a usability point of view,\nDT applications\
    \ rely on sensor information from the object layer to help the DT build\nthe digital\
    \ clone of the physical system. In this case, adversaries can launch attacks on\n\
    sensor or gateway, such as a denial of service (DoS) attack or malware propagation.\
    \ Once\nthe gateway or sensor is compromised, it is difﬁcult for DT to obtain\
    \ the overall states of\nthe physical system. For this reason, it is important\
    \ to propose and validate mitigation\nmechanisms to reduce the impact of such\
    \ attacks.\n5. Research Directions\nIn extending the DT to IoT scenarios, promising\
    \ new ﬁelds arise that are worthy of\nfurther investigation. We will discuss the\
    \ future research directions from the following as-\npects: performance, new DT-driven\
    \ services, modeling and machine learning, and security\nand privacy.\n5.1. Performance\n\
    As we discussed in Section 4, the DT in CPS has very strict performance requirements\n\
    to achieve real-time computing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ We believe\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n19 of 25\nthat the joint optimization\
    \ of sensing, control, networking, computing, and data analysis is\ncritically\
    \ important for DT to meet these performance requirements. There have been some\n\
    works focused on one of these optimization targets (sensing, control, networking,\
    \ or data\nanalysis), and some results have been achieved. However, if we need\
    \ to maximize the\noverall performance of the system, we must study the interaction\
    \ between all components\nand design a joint optimization strategy. Taking the\
    \ intelligent transportation system as\nan example, suppose we are generating\
    \ DT for moving vehicles in a certain area to better\nmanage trafﬁc. We use sensor\
    \ data from both vehicles and cities to build DT. When we\nselect data, simply\
    \ having more data is not optimal. Instead, the pre-processing of the data\nshould\
    \ account for the quality of the data, the bandwidth of the network, the computing\n\
    power of the infrastructure, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of\
    \ the speciﬁc\napplication. Similarly, when we are transmitting the data, we need\
    \ to consider not only\nthe current communication environment but also the mobility\
    \ of the vehicle, and the data\nstorage space of the vehicle, among others.\n\
    5.2. New DT-Driven Services\nBy combining DT and IoT search services, we can interconnect\
    \ different CPS systems\nand provide more services. Speciﬁcally, the DT bridges\
    \ CPS in disparate domains, such\nas transportation, energy, and manufacturing,\
    \ to obtain a ubiquitous connection. The DT\nenables more data sharing to create\
    \ abundant content that improves the IoT search results.\nFor example, the DT\
    \ bridges electric cars that primarily consume energy with the smart grid\nthat\
    \ primarily generates and stores electricity. With DT, electric cars can obtain\
    \ seamless\nand efﬁcient energy supply via the information from digitized charging\
    \ piles, solar planes,\nand so on. IoT search services such as location-based\
    \ search and content-based search can\nalso help us ﬁnd IoT devices and data to\
    \ build DTs [48,106]. This is particularly important\nin the rapidly changing\
    \ CPS environment.\nFor example, in the smart transportation system, suppose we\
    \ are using smart cameras\nto build digital clones of vehicles. After a few seconds,\
    \ the vehicle drives out of the range\nof the smart camera. We can use the location-based\
    \ IoT search service to ﬁnd other cameras\naround the vehicle to ensure that DT\
    \ can continue to work. As another example, if we want\nto know the moving trajectory\
    \ of vehicle, we can use a content-based IoT search service to\nﬁnd all the information\
    \ that contains the vehicle license plate. Finally, some new services\ncan be\
    \ provided by DT on different CPS. For example, in the smart manufacturing system,\n\
    operators can check DT through algorithms to quickly perform quality inspections\
    \ on a\nlarge number of products. In the smart home, users can integrate smart\
    \ cameras and VR\ndevices to provide holographic remote social interaction. In\
    \ the smart grid, DT can be used\nto monitor the status of infrastructures in\
    \ real time. In smart health care, DT can be used to\nmonitor and record the vital\
    \ signs of patients so that doctors can make better treatment\nplans. Likewise,\
    \ in the smart transportation system, DT can be used to dynamically plan\nroutes\
    \ and provide additional driving assistance functions such as blind spot monitoring,\n\
    brake warning, etc.\n5.3. Modeling and Machine Learning\nConsidering the challenges\
    \ of modeling a complex system in Section 4.2, a modeling\nmethodology that can\
    \ be adapted to different CPS systems is worth studying. There are\ntwo major\
    \ directions that should be investigated: model-based DT and model-free DT.\n\
    For model-based DT, the main problem is that the CPS system is difﬁcult to mathe-\n\
    matically model, and there are signiﬁcant differences between different CPS. Therefore,\n\
    any model that works and is complete for one CPS will need to be re-modeled every\
    \ time\nthe CPS changes. To address this problem, one solution is modular DT.\
    \ This focuses on\nbuilding the DT of the small objects of the system and combining\
    \ them to form the DT of\nthe entire system, instead of building the entire system\
    \ from the beginning. This not only\nreduces the complexity of building a DT model\
    \ but also uses the constructed DT models to\ncreate a different combination DT\
    \ systems.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n20 of 25\nIn model-free DT, we establish\
    \ DT by frequently collecting information on physical\nobjects. Because this kind\
    \ of DT completely relies on observations and disregards mathe-\nmatical model\
    \ support, it is difﬁcult for us to predict the state of the system, which greatly\n\
    affects the control and optimization of the DT system. Therefore, we consider\
    \ using DL to\ngenerate a neural network-based model by learning data collected\
    \ from the CPS devices.\nIn this case, even for very complex systems that are\
    \ difﬁcult to model, we can still use DL\nmodels to build DT. Nonetheless, one\
    \ problem is that ML/DL algorithms usually require a\nlarge amount of data, which\
    \ is sometimes difﬁcult to provide for CPS devices with limited\nresources. Therefore,\
    \ it is worth investigating the best way to design DL models that\nwork for small\
    \ amounts of data. Moreover, training a DL model requires considerable\ncomputing\
    \ power, and trained models need to be retrained once the environment changes,\n\
    both of which are obviously too demanding for CPS devices. To solve these problems,\
    \ we\nbelieve that using transfer learning is a promising solution [107]. Transfer\
    \ learning is an ML\ntechnology that can transfer the learned knowledge from one\
    \ a well-trained model to a new\nlearning model. Speciﬁcally, with transfer learning,\
    \ we can use a generic DL model trained\nwith large amount of the data as the\
    \ source model and replace several of the last (terminal)\nlayers in the network\
    \ to construct a new model. During the training phase, we only update\nthe replaced\
    \ layers. By using this transfer learning technique, we can use less training\
    \ data\nto obtain better performance than training from scratch. Because there\
    \ are fewer network\nparameters that need to be trained, this method also reduces\
    \ the requirements for device\ncomputing power and storage space. Therefore, it\
    \ is suitable for real-time computing,\nreal-time control, and real-time communication\
    \ in a large-scale distributed CPS system.\nFinally, we should consider the integration\
    \ of model-based DT and model-free DT\ninto a hybrid-model DT. Even in the most\
    \ complex cps system, there will be components\nthat can be easily mathematically\
    \ modeled. Therefore, we can mathematically model those\ncomponents of the system\
    \ that are easily modeled and use a model-free approach such as\nDL to model the\
    \ remaining components. Once a DL-based model is trained, it can be treated\n\
    as a modular model and directly integrated with other model-based DTs in a modular\n\
    DT system. For example, in the smart transportation system, we can mathematically\n\
    model the mobility of vehicles and use DL to model the Internet of Vehicle communication.\n\
    By combining these two components together, we can obtain a complete DT of moving\n\
    vehicles in CPS.\n5.4. Security and Privacy\nDT applications rely on data provided\
    \ by IoT sensors and gateways. In this case, data\nand communication security\
    \ and privacy are an important research direction. In consider-\ning security,\
    \ we discuss the research from several perspectives: conﬁdentiality, integrity,\n\
    and availability.\nIn terms of conﬁdentiality, we now take the smart transportation\
    \ system as an example.\nDT obtains data from IoT sensors installed near roads,\
    \ vehicles, etc. At the same time, IoT\nsensors may belong to different organizations/operators.\
    \ In this case, different organiza-\ntions/operators need to ensure the conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data through some authentication\nand secured communication protocols. In\
    \ addition, some data stored in the application\nlayer, such as vehicle location\
    \ and trafﬁc camera data, are sensitive. Thus, access control\nneeds to be in\
    \ place to protect user privacy. At the same time, some information security\n\
    regulations can protect user privacy and achieve data conﬁdentiality by restricting\
    \ data\nsharing, especially on the end-user layer. For example, in the ﬁeld of\
    \ healthcare, Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) will\
    \ be used to regulate the sharing\nand conﬁdentiality of user medical data.\n\
    For the sake of integrity, some DT applications, including smart grid, smart transporta-\n\
    tion, smart manufacturing, and smart cities, require real-time data to build a\
    \ digital model\nof the DT system. In this case, data integrity is essential for\
    \ the DT system to correctly\nmodel and guide the physical system in response\
    \ to changes in the environment. Based\non the DT architecture, we discuss the\
    \ integrity of the four layers. For the object layer,\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n21 of 25\nthe sensors need to communicate with the gateways. In this case,\
    \ the communication\nfrom sensor to gateway and gateway to sensor at the application\
    \ layer needs to be secured\nto prevent an adversary from hijacking the communication\
    \ using a man-in-the-middle\n(MITM) attack or others. In addition, authentication\
    \ and other security mechanisms must\nbe in place to restrict unauthorized users\
    \ from modifying data. At the same time, at the\napplication layer, anomaly detection\
    \ can be used to detect manipulated data to ensure data\nintegrity. Finally, an\
    \ authentication system can be implemented at the end user level to\nprevent unauthorized\
    \ users from accessing DT.\nFinally, availability is key to real-time DT. Certain\
    \ types of cyber attacks, including\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) and\
    \ malware propagation, can target sensors and\ngateways. In this case, mitigation\
    \ schemes need to be implemented on the gateways to\nﬁlter malicious trafﬁc and\
    \ reduce the impact of attacks. At the same time, an adversary can\nsend time-consuming\
    \ queries or massive queries through the end user layer to overload the\nDT. To\
    \ deal with such threats, mitigation schemes can be deployed at the application\
    \ layer\nto avert the affects. Moreover, in a certain period of time, there may\
    \ be multiple normal\nusers accessing the same service at the same time. In this\
    \ case, load balancing algorithms\ncan be deployed on the gateway. If a gateway\
    \ is overloaded, the algorithm can use nearby\nlow-load gateways to process the\
    \ request, leading to a highly resilient system.\n6. Final Remarks\nWith the rapid\
    \ advance of big data and ML/DL techniques, the cyber replica of a real\nphysical\
    \ system has been considered as a viable digital platform to emulate lifecycle\
    \ use\ncases for CPS. DT is the cyber replica of the real physical system, which\
    \ consists of real-time\ncomputing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ By leveraging the DT with\na physical system, we can imitate real-world cases\
    \ in physical systems, without directly\noperating the real-world system, to optimize\
    \ system performance. DT can also simulate\nemergency situations of the system,\
    \ allowing system operators to practice emergency plans.\nFurthermore, DT could\
    \ enable data sharing to support more data-oriented services on\nCPS. DT needs\
    \ to represent things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient manner, which poses\n\
    numerous challenges to the networking, control, computing, and data analysis of\
    \ CPS.\nFurthermore, the design of DT shall consider numerous exceptional requirements\
    \ of CPS\n(e.g., latency, reliability, safety, scalability, security, and privacy).\
    \ In this paper, we have\nﬁrst reviewed the principles of DT (architecture, data\
    \ presentation, and protocols). We\nhave then presented how to integrate DT in\
    \ different CPS, including smart grid, smart\ntransportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities. We have further discussed some\nchallenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security perspectives. Finally, we have\noutlined\
    \ future research directions from the perspectives of performance, new DT-driven\n\
    services, modeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ existing in the water-saving irrigation monitoring system, \nsuch as small monitoring\
    \ area, complicated wiring etc., a soil information monitoring system of \nwater-saving\
    \ irrigation based on Fuzzy PID control strategy was designed. The wireless sensor\
    \ node \nis developed with CC2530 as the core, and the real time monitoring of\
    \ temperature and humidity in \nsoil environment is completed. The system adopts\
    \ ZigBee technology to realize wireless sensor \nnetwork and automatic gathering\
    \ of monitoring data, realizes soil temperature and humidity \nadjustment based\
    \ on fuzzy PID control technology, and adopts embedded database management \n\
    mode to realize terminal node and data management and so on. Compared to the other\
    \ network \nmonitoring technology, this system is characterized with flexible\
    \ configuration, which can be \nwidely used in the place unattended or in poor\
    \ condition. The test run results have shown that this \nsystem had many advantages\
    \ such as low power consumption, flexible networking, scalability, \nfriendly\
    \ interface, etc. \n1. Introduction \nWith the continuous development of modern\
    \ agriculture, the quality and safety of farmland \nirrigation is increasingly\
    \ demanded, and the quality of irrigation capacity directly affects the quality\
    \ \nof crop growth [1][2], so the stable, efficient and low cost operation of\
    \ irrigation equipment has \nbecome the main technical requirements of fine agricultural\
    \ industry transformation in recent years \n[3]. Agricultural irrigation involves\
    \ a large area, and the terrain of the control area is complex. The \ntraditional\
    \ water-saving irrigation monitoring system mainly uses wired mode [4]. The field\
    \ control \npoints and measuring points are many and scattered, the operation\
    \ is tedious, the connection cable is \nmany, the failure rate is high, is not\
    \ conducive to the use and maintenance [5]. Wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN), composed\
    \ of a large number of sensor nodes, is a new advanced technology for \ndata acquisition,\
    \ processing and wireless transmission [6]. It has the advantages of simple \n\
    deployment, low cost, no need for on-site maintenance, and has broad application\
    \ prospects in the \nfield of environmental monitoring [7]. Some scholars have\
    \ applied wireless communication \ntechnology to water-saving irrigation [8],\
    \ but these technologies usually have the shortcomings of \nhigh cost, high power\
    \ consumption and unsatisfactory precision, so cannot be widely applied. \nAiming\
    \ at the existing problems of water-saving irrigation monitoring system, this\
    \ paper adopts \nthe intelligent sensor network ZigBee technology and embedded\
    \ technology to design a farmland \nenvironment water-saving irrigation monitoring\
    \ system. Its advantages are low power consumption, \nlow cost, friendly man-machine\
    \ interface, and automatic information collection and processing. The \nsystem\
    \ is based on data wireless transceiver, using multi-hop routing, real-time monitoring\
    \ and \nissuing data information and control instructions, using fuzzy PID control\
    \ technology to achieve the \ninjection speed of each valve, start and stop decisions,\
    \ intelligent regulation of irrigation timing and \nwater volume. Therefore, the\
    \ control accuracy and irrigation efficiency can be improved, so as to \nrealize\
    \ intelligent monitoring of water-saving irrigation. \n2018 7th International\
    \ Conference on Advanced Materials and Computer Science (ICAMCS 2018)\nPublished\
    \ by CSP © 2018 the Authors\n122\n \n2. System Structure  \n2.1 Requirement Analysis\
    \ of Monitoring System.  \nIn view of the characteristics of large lag and inertia\
    \ in farmland soil temperature and humidity, \nthrough investigation and analysis,\
    \ the application requirements of environmental monitoring \nsystem include: a)\
    \ Realizing real-time collection, processing and wireless transmission of \nenvironmental\
    \ temperature and humidity on-line all day. b) Applying ZigBee wireless \ncommunication\
    \ mode to transmit and aggregate the uploaded data in real time. c) The upper\
    \ \ncomputer carries on the information processing, provides the fault diagnosis,\
    \ the over-limit alarm \nprompt manager, in order to carry on the decision, complete\
    \ the sensor management, the \nenvironment information storage and the analysis\
    \ processing and so on. In other words, according \nto the predetermined control\
    \ strategy to form a control output, direct action in the production \nprocess.\
    \ \n2.2 System Overall Design.  \nThis system is based on ZigBee tree topology\
    \ sensor network, including terminal nodes, gateway \nnodes and monitoring center.\
    \ The terminal node is composed of sensor nodes and connected to \nnetwork, which\
    \ task is to collect soil environment temperature and humidity data and upload\
    \ them \nto the gateway node wirelessly. ZigBee coordinator operates the gateway\
    \ node, which is responsible \nfor receiving data information and communicating\
    \ with monitoring center through serial port. The \nmonitoring center includes\
    \ a PC computer and related management software. In addition to \nproviding graphical\
    \ operation interface, data display and staff query, it can also provide \nout-of-gauge\
    \ alarm prompt, and form control output according to pre-determined control strategy.\
    \ \n3. Fuzzy PID Controller and Algorithm Design of Soil Moisture  \n3.1 Fuzzy\
    \ PID Control Strategy.  \nBecause the characteristics of temperature and humidity\
    \ control in farmland soil are \nmultivariable, large inertia nonlinearity, parameter\
    \ coupling, pure delay, long control and regulation \ntime and obvious overshoot,\
    \ it is impossible to establish an accurate mathematical model, and it is \ndifficult\
    \ to achieve satisfactory control accuracy by using classical control methods.\
    \ Fuzzy control \nstrategy is based on human thinking, and has the advantages\
    \ of simple design and strong robustness. \nTherefore, this paper chooses the\
    \ fuzzy control algorithm to control the environmental factors of the \nsystem,\
    \ and uses software tools to design the fuzzy control system. \n3.2 Realization\
    \ of Fuzzy PID Control of Soil Moisture.  \nThe fuzzy controller organizes the\
    \ control decision table according to the manual control rules, \nand then determines\
    \ the control quantity by this vote. This paper combines fuzzy control with PID\
    \ \ncontrol, which not only has the advantages of flexibility and adaptability\
    \ of fuzzy control, but also \nhas the characteristics of high precision of PID\
    \ control. \nBy calculating the current system humidity error and error rate of\
    \ change, using fuzzy rules for \nfuzzy reasoning, query the fuzzy rules table\
    \ for parameter adjustment. The structure of fuzzy PID \ncontroller is shown in\
    \ Fig.1. \n \nFig.1. Fuzzy PID humidity controller structure  \n123\n \nIn this\
    \ paper, the fuzzy PID controller is applied to humidity control. Its error and\
    \ rate of change \nare used as input language variables, and the input and control\
    \ variables of the controlled process \nare used as output language variables.\
    \ Thus, the system stability can be guaranteed, the overshoot of \nthe response\
    \ process can be reduced and the oscillation phenomenon can be weakened. The fuzzy\
    \ \nrelation between the three parameters of PID controller and sum is found out,\
    \ and the three \nparameters are adjusted according to the principle of fuzzy\
    \ control to meet the different \nrequirements of control parameters at different\
    \ times, so that the controlled object has good \ndynamic and static performance.\
    \ By summarizing the process and operator's experience, the control \nrule statements\
    \ are obtained, and the temperature fuzzy control rule table is established. The\
    \ \nsolution is to make a fuzzy control query table as shown in Table 1, and to\
    \ perform fuzzy operation \nby software query. \nTable.1. Fuzzy control Query\
    \ table of humidity \ne \nec \n-4 -3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0 \n+1 +2 +3 +4 \n-4 -6 -5 \n\

    \ to implement fuzzy reasoning using fuzzy rules. \nThe specific implementation\
    \ method is to store the sum fuzzy control table computed, and offline in \nthe\
    \ memory data block, and periodically interrupt the subroutine of inquiring the\
    \ fuzzy control table \nevery 30 ms. Then the fuzzy control table is querying\
    \ according to the quantization value, and the \nquantization value is obtained.\

    \ Monitoring System \n4.1 System Hardware Design.  \nSensor node is the basic\
    \ unit of water-saving irrigation monitoring system, which completes the \nfunctions\
    \ of environmental temperature and humidity data acquisition, processing, wireless\
    \ \ncommunication and so on. Under the application background of Water-saving\
    \ Irrigation Soil \nEnvironmental monitoring, sensor node design focuses on low\
    \ cost, low power consumption, \nstability, reliability and other factors. Wireless\
    \ transceiver module includes CC2530 and related \nperipheral circuits, communication\
    \ between gateway node and monitoring computer, application of \nmicroprocessor's\
    \ P3.0 port (serial data receiver), P3.1 port (serial data transmitter), and level\
    \ \nconversion chip MAX232, RS232 communication interface to achieve the TTL level\
    \ output by \nmicroprocessor into PC. RS232 level, using 5V power supply, requires\
    \ fewer peripheral \ncomponents, and comply with EIA/TIA232 communication standards,\
    \ transmission rate up to 220 \nkbps. The hardware block diagram of the terminal\
    \ node is shown in Fig.3. \n \nFig.3. Terminal node hardware block diagram \n\
    Gateway node function is to complete data correction, fusion, and send to the\
    \ monitoring center, \nbut also to obtain instructions, after processing, sent\
    \ to the control equipment. CC2530 can meet the \nstorage and communication requirements\
    \ of water-saving irrigation temperature and humidity \nmonitoring system. Therefore,\

    \ \nThe software architecture of the system consists of data acquisition software\
    \ and data receiver \nsoftware, including transmitter and receiver program, and\
    \ initialization program. Sensor nodes are \n125\n \nmainly responsible for collecting\
    \ sensor data and transmitting these data to the central control node, \nwhile\
    \ receiving data from the central control node and operating on the basis of these\
    \ data. In the \nnode software design, the device initialization, network configuration\
    \ and network start-up of the \nnetwork management layer are accomplished by calling\
    \ the API function provided by ZigBee \nprotocol stack, thus realizing the self-organizing\
    \ network of wireless sensor nodes distributed in \nmultiple greenhouses. In order\
    \ to further reduce the node power consumption, a flexible and \ndynamic configuration\
    \ of timing data acquisition, timing sleep and wake-up is designed. The flow \n\
    chart of terminal node main program and interrupt service subroutine is shown\
    \ in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 \nrespectively. \n                \n \nFig.4. Terminal\
    \ node software flow chart     Fig.5. Interrupt service subroutine flow chart\
    \ \n5.2 Software and Structure Design of Monitoring Center.  \nMonitoring center\
    \ management system is responsible for sending acquisition commands, \nreceiving\
    \ acquisition data, while publishing data on the server to meet the client's browsing.\
    \ Its \nmain tasks are: monitoring all flowmeters synchronously, realizing on-line\
    \ monitoring functions \nsuch as over-standard alarm; collecting data and checking\
    \ cyclic redundancy (CRC) to ensure data \nreliability; using wireless transmission\
    \ mode, data real-time transmission to the monitoring center; \nmonitoring data\
    \ and time information can be automatically stored to the database server; realizing\
    \ \nreal-time data transmission; Time curve display, historical curve query, data\
    \ report printing and \nreal-time display according to the needs of sub-items,\
    \ historical query according to time; when the \ndata collected by a node is abnormal,\
    \ record and alarm, in order to eliminate hidden dangers. Based \non LabWindows/CVI\
    \ software, this paper records and analyzes the collected data, and completes\
    \ \nthe comparison of similar signals, the display of historical and spatial data\
    \ of different nodes. The \nmain program flow chart of the monitoring center is\

    \ Experimental Environment.  \nBecause of completing a number of detection and\
    \ control, combined with the latest wireless \nZigBee ad hoc network technology\
    \ design to complete the system, and then carried out \nexperimental testing.\
    \ Considering the cost of the experiment, 5 points are randomly arranged \naccording\
    \ to the requirement, the buried depth is about 18 cm, and the numbers are set\
    \ to be *1~*5. \nThe data are collected by 5 temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ in real time and sent to the PC of the \nmonitoring center to display the collected\
    \ parameters directly.  \n6.2 Experimental Results and Analysis.  \nThe test results\
    \ show that the temperature and humidity sensing node can pass through obstacles\
    \ \nsuch as field instruments and equipment within the range of 13m, and can realize\
    \ data acquisition, \ntransmission and list display. The ability of wrong correction\
    \ of the network is good and the data \naccuracy is high. Once the detection parameters\
    \ exceed the limit, the computer response time is \ngenerally less than 3 seconds,\
    \ display the address and exceed the limit parameter value, and alarm \nprompt.\

  explanation: The paper highlights the implications of environmental factors, such
    as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on wireless data transmission in
    agricultural settings. It examines the challenges faced and explores potential
    solutions to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission for automated irrigation
    systems.
  extract_1: As wireless sensor networks become more prevalent in agricultural settings,
    it is important to consider the impact of environmental factors on data transmission.
    Weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog, can attenuate or block radio
    signals, making it difficult for sensors to communicate with each other and with
    the central controller. Physical obstacles, such as trees, buildings, and hills,
    can also interfere with signal propagation.
  extract_2: To overcome the challenges of wireless data transmission in agricultural
    settings, a number of different solutions can be employed. These solutions include
    using higher-power transmitters, increasing the number of sensors, and using mesh
    networks. Higher-power transmitters can improve the range and reliability of wireless
    signals, but they can also be more expensive and power-hungry. Increasing the
    number of sensors can help to ensure that there is always a clear path between
    at least two sensors, even if some sensors are blocked by obstacles. Mesh networks
    can also be used to improve reliability by creating multiple paths for data to
    travel.

    Comments Skip Abstract Section Abstract Animals play a profoundly important and
    intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands
    of years, but now they work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and
    rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture
    today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock,
    and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened
    with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitats.
    There are many reasons, including societal and economic ones, to explore how new
    computing technologies can be used to ensure the welfare of animals in these settings.
    The goal of this review is to systematically survey the existing literature in
    smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm, and wild animal welfare.
    We use a broad notion of animal welfare to refer to an assessment of whether animals
    are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and positively stimulated in their environment.
    Smart computing and sensing is also used in broad terms, to refer to systems that
    are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of
    remote data collection, processing, exchange, and analysis. The findings of this
    review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering,
    as well as contribute to data, information, and communication management for animal
    welfare. References Joelle Alcaidinho. 2016. Canine behavior and working dog suitability

  extract_1: '"It is extremely important to instruct the agricultural production by
    knowing the crop it self’s information. The farmland system is a very complicated
    ecology system, involves different kinds of factors. Even the crop itself is a
    complicated system. The collecting of crop data usually incurs the substantial
    costs and technologies [4]. To understand the characteristic of crop information
    fully is very necessary. There are the characteristic of farmland crop information.
    A) Spatiality. The production of crop is associated with spatial factors. Every
    farmland has its own geographic location and boundaries. Spatial data is usually
    used in generating different maps as coordinates. B) Complexity. Any agricultural
    system has huge factors include not only directly related factors but also indirectly
    related factors. Each factor contains its sub-factors. Farmland crop data can
    be collected from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, handheld devices,
    remote sensing, satellite, history material, etc. Categories of data are diverse,
    including text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the information
    is changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time acquisition
    of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty
    of getting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable
    measurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data."'
  extract_2: '"Crop water information collection is the basis of precision irrigation
    decision-making. It is a key for continuously, quickly, and precisely information
    collecting. Crop water information is helpful to develop advanced and reliable
    monitoring equipment. Crop water status information collection technologies of
    crop individual include infrared temperature method, leaf water potential, spectral
    method, etc. Regional crop water status information is mainly obtained through
    remote sensing methods, including thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave
    remote sensing methods [28]. Ji Haiyan et al. [29] used near-infrared spectroscopy,
    developed a living plant leaves water testing instrument which adopts ultra-low-power
    microprocessor MSP430 and new type of optical frequency conversion chip TSL230,
    enabled field site fast non-destructive testing of crop leaf water content. Li
    Dongsheng et al. [30] developed the leaf temperature-measuring instrument, using
    infrared thermometry to measure leaf temperature to estimate leaf moisture state.
    Canopy temperature relative to ambient air temperature is often used to assess
    plant stress caused by moisture deficit or high temperature [31] [32]. Continuous
    measurement of plant canopy temperature is useful in both research and agricultural
    production."'

    \ fine agricultural practice. Crop information acquisition technologies \nhave\
    \ become the most effective means to increasing crop production and \nimproving\
    \ crop quality. In this paper, on the basis of introducing the \ncharacteristics\
    \ of farmland crop data, different farmland crop information \nacquisition methods\
    \ are surveyed in detail, sections need to be improved of \nthese methods and\
    \ related core technologies will be discussed. At last, this \npaper gives a table\
    \ about crop information acquisition technology and sensing \ninstrument systems\
    \ applied in different levels (individual level, area level and \nwide-area level).\
    \ \nKeywords: precision agriculture (PA), crop information, information acquisition.\
    \  \n1 \nIntroduction \nAll Food is the paramount necessity of human beings, and\
    \ the essential material basis \nfor any country on the way of development. China\
    \ is a great agricultural country with \nlarge population, limited soil resources\
    \ and traditional manual farming methods. With \nall these challenges, precision\
    \ agriculture (PA) technologies have been used to \nimprove field practices in\
    \ crop production these years. PA provides a way to optimize \nagricultural production\
    \ inputs, such as irrigation, fertilizing and spraying, based on \nfarmland soil,\
    \ environment and crop information at individual areas within a field, \nrather\
    \ than applying uniform inputs across the entire field. In this way people can\
    \ \nobtain not only the best economic benefits but also the ecological benefits.\
    \ \nThe three main components involved in PA are information acquisition, data\
    \ \ninterpretation, and variable-rate application. The PA is an information-based\
    \ \ntechnology. Only spatial information on field conditions as well as inputs\
    \ and outputs \nof the field are accurately collected, can PA be successful [1].\
    \ The technology of \nfarmland information acquisition directly affects the degree\
    \ of agricultural \ninformatization and the accuracy of agricultural production’s\
    \ decisions. How to get \nfield soil, environment and crop information conveniently\
    \ and quickly is the critical \nissue throughout the entire process of PA. Yet\
    \ conventional acquisition method of \nfarmland information, which mainly including\
    \ traditional information retrieval \nmethods and chemical diagnostic methods\
    \ have many limitations. As to be known, \nappearance analysis method has strong\
    \ subjectivity and poor accuracy; chemical \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information\
    \ Acquisition \n207 \n \ndiagnosis is based on laboratory analysis of crop organizations,\
    \ generally requires \nanalyzing samples of crop, costs a lot of time, manpower\
    \ and material resources [2]. \nThe PA requires fast, real-time and positioning\
    \ measurement. As the traditional crop \ninformation acquisition methods cannot\
    \ meet the requirement of variable fertilization, \nwe need to develop new methods,\
    \ especially the technical method and sensing \nequipment can be used for fast\
    \ acquisition of farmland information must be developed \nto meet the need of\
    \ PA research and practice. \nFarmland information can be divided into three parts:\
    \ soil information, \nenvironment information, and crop information [3]. Soil\
    \ information, including soil \nmoisture, pH, organic matter content, conductivity,\
    \ soil nutrients, and soil tillage \nresistance and etc. is the one of the main\
    \ object of studying farmland information. \nFarmland environment information\
    \ includes air temperature, humidity, light intensity, \ncrop pests, and etc.\
    \ Crop information includes crop growth information (such as \ncanopy structure,\
    \ leaf area index, plant height, etc.), crop nutrition information \n(including\
    \ chlorophyll content, crop water status, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium \netc.)\
    \ and some other information. Crop information is the most important index used\
    \ \nin regulating plant growth, diagnosing crop nutrient deficiency, and predicting\
    \ crop \nyields. All these information can make a contribution to agricultural\
    \ land management \nand decision-making. High production, high-efficiency and\
    \ modernizing agriculture \ncan’t become true without the help of all kinds of\
    \ information.  \nIn this paper, on the basis of introducing the characteristics\
    \ of farmland data, \ndifferent farmland crop information acquisition methods\
    \ and related core technologies \nwill be surveyed and discussed. \n2 \nCharacteristic\
    \ of Farmland Crop Information \nIt is extremely important to instruct the agricultural\
    \ production by knowing the crop it \nself’s information. The farmland system\
    \ is a very complicated ecology system, \ninvolves different kinds of factors.\
    \ Even the crop itself is a complicated system. The \ncollecting of crop data\
    \ usually incurs the substantial costs and technologies [4]. To \nunderstand the\
    \ characteristic of crop information fully is very necessary. There are the \n\
    characteristic of farmland crop information. A) Spatiality. The production of\
    \ crop is \nassociated with spatial factors. Every farmland has its own geographic\
    \ location and \nboundaries. Spatial data is usually used in generating different\
    \ maps as coordinates. \nB) Complexity. Any agricultural system has huge factors\
    \ include not only directly \nrelated factors but also indirectly related factors.\
    \ Each factor contains its sub-factors. \nFarmland crop data can be collected\
    \ from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, \nhandheld devices, remote sensing,\
    \ satellite, history material, etc.  Categories of data \nare diverse, including\
    \ text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the \ninformation is\
    \ changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time \nacquisition\
    \ of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty\
    \ of \ngetting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable\
    \ \nmeasurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data. \n\
    208 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \n3 \nCrop Information Acquisition Methods \nCrop information\
    \ includes crop growth information, crop nutrition information, and \nsome other\
    \ information. \n3.1 \nCrop Growth Information \nGround observation, remote sensing\
    \ monitoring and model simulation are the main \nmethods of monitor crop growth\
    \ and development information. The leaf area index \n(LAI), canopy characterization,\
    \ canopy structure, plant height and other growth \nfactors are the main target\
    \ be measured to monitor crop-growing status [6].  \nRemote sensing is becoming\
    \ more and more popular for its unique advantages.  \nM. Susan Moran et al. [7]\
    \ successfully used aerial and satellite remote sensing data to \ninverse normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, which can be used for \ndiagnosis,\
    \ estimation and production forecasting of large area crops [8]. Huang \nJingfeng\
    \ et al. [9] established Rice-SRS model to estimate the yield of rice with \n\
    spectral normalized vegetation index obtained by NOAA/AVHRR satellite. Peng \n\
    Xiao et al. [10] used the TM remote sensing image to obtain NDVI and inverse the\
    \ \nLAI of rice. On the basis of domestic airborne imaging spectrum data and the\
    \ spectral \nresponse of the synchronous sampling data, Yang Minhua et al [11]\
    \ established wheat \ncanopy physical and chemical parameters estimation model\
    \ and realized the inversion \nof wheat canopy physical and chemical parameters\
    \ through aerial hyper spectral \nremote sensing.  \nInfrared beam, ultrasonic,\
    \ microelectrode constant current source technology and \nsome other technologies\
    \ can be used to monitor and analyze growing crops directly. \nShimizu H et al.\
    \ [12] used machine vision technology to non-contact measure three-\ndimensional\
    \ growth information of crops. Zhao Chunjiang et al. [13] developed an \ninstrument\
    \ to inverse LAI, vegetation cover degree, biomass index to assess crop \ncondition.\
    \ This instrument uses the near-infrared and red characteristic bands, and \n\
    detects the incident light and the reflected light of vegetation to get the NDVI\
    \ \n(normalized difference vegetation index) values. Aziz S A et al. [14] studied\
    \ \nultrasonic sensing technology. They used it as one approach for corn plant\
    \ canopy \ncharacterization. Lan Yubin et al. [15] developed a ground-based Multi-sensor\
    \ fusion \nintegration system, including a crop height sensor, a crop canopy analyzer\
    \ for LAI, a \nNDVI sensor, a multispectral camera, and a hyper spectroradiometer\
    \ to measure real-\ntime crop conditions involve NDVI, biomass, crop canopy structure,\
    \ and crop height. \nQu Yonghua et al. [16] developed an automatic system designed\
    \ on the basis of \nwireless sensors network (WSN) to collect crop structure parameters,\
    \ like LAI and \naverage leaf angle (ALA).  \nPlant height is an important parameter\
    \ to be considered for management decision \nmaking. Plant height is a sensitive\
    \ indicator to show plant health status and calculate \nyield potential in optimizing\
    \ field inputs. Sui Ruixiu et al. [17] used ultrasonic sensors \nto develop a\
    \ microcomputer-based measurement system to allow in-situ, non-\ndestructive measurement\
    \ for the morphological characteristics of bush-type plants. \nSearcy S W et al.\
    \ [18] developed and field-tested an infrared beam sensor mounted on \n \nA Survey\
    \ on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n209 \n \na mechanical arm, using\
    \ a “light curtain” for the cotton plant real-time height \nmeasurement. Tumbo\
    \ S D et al. [19] successfully used ultrasonic sensors in the \nmeasurement of\
    \ citrus tree volume. Ehsani M R et al. [20] investigated a laser-based \nsensor\
    \ which can realize real-time estimate of plant volume. The sensor also \nperformed\
    \ well in measuring the biomass and LAI of a plant after being calibrated. \n\
    Jones C L et al. [21] used ultrasonic distance sensing to realize plant height\
    \ data \ncollection, and estimated plant biomass using the product of top-view\
    \ surface area of \nthe plant. Sui Ruixiu et al. [22] used an ultrasonic sensor\
    \ installed on a field vehicle \nsuch as a sprayer to scan the plant canopy and\
    \ determine plant height in real time in \nsitu. A plant height map was generated\
    \ with the collected data by the sensor. \n3.2 \nCrop Nutrition Information \n\
    For crop chlorophyll content nondestructive testing, MINOLTA company in Japan\
    \ \nhas produced a kind of Chlorophyll meter, which emit red light (about 650nm)\
    \ and \nnear infrared light (about 940nm) by the light emitting diode to the receiver\
    \ through \nthe leaf samples. The receiver receives the signals and transfers\
    \ them into digital \nsignals that will be used by the microprocessor to calculate\
    \ the SPAD value. Yao \nJiansong et al. [23] used visible-near infrared spectroscopy\
    \ techniques to non-\ndestructive test rape leaf chlorophyll content information.\
    \ Liu Fei et al. [24] used \nvisible/near infrared spectrum technology, quickly\
    \ and accurately detected cucumber \nleaf SPAD value, which is helpful to the\
    \ development of testing equipment. \nNitrogen is one of the most important factors\
    \ that have a high impact on the \nproduction of crops. The main methods of monitoring\
    \ nitrogen are remote sensing \nimaging, machine vision technology, spectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Multi-spectral \nand hyperspectral imaging technology [25]. The\
    \ remote sensing based crop nitrogen \nnutrition diagnosis, most people use remote\
    \ sensing to inverse nitrogen concentration, \nnitrogen accumulation and other\
    \ parameters which can determine crop nitrogen \nnutritional status [26]. He Yong\
    \ et al. [2] developed a portable plant nutrients lossless \ntester to determine\
    \ plant chlorophyll, water, nitrogen content quickly, non-destructive, \nand simultaneously.\
    \ This instrument has a GPS and a wireless data transmission \nfunction. Combined\
    \ with GIS software management system, large-scale crop nutrient \ncontent distribution\
    \ map can be developed. Feng lei et al. [27] put the rape as the \nresearch object,\
    \ used computer multi-spectral imaging technology for rapidly, \naccurately and\
    \ non-destructive nitrogen diagnosis. \nCrop water information collection is the\
    \ basis of precision irrigation decision-\nmaking. It is a key for continuously,\
    \ quickly, and precisely information collecting. \nCrop water information is helpful\
    \ to develop advanced and reliable monitoring \nequipment. Crop water status information\
    \ collection technologies of crop individual \ninclude infrared temperature method,\
    \ leaf water potential, spectral method, etc. \nRegional crop water status information\
    \ is mainly obtained through remote sensing \nmethods, including thermal infrared\
    \ remote sensing and microwave remote sensing \nmethods [28]. Ji Haiyan et al.\
    \ [29] used near-infrared spectroscopy, developed a \nliving plant leaves water\
    \ testing instrument which adopts ultra-low-power \nmicroprocessor MSP430 and\
    \ new type of optical frequency conversion chip TSL230, \n210 \nD. Yi and H. Ji\
    \ \n \nenabled field site fast non-destructive testing of crop leaf water content.\
    \ Li \nDongsheng et al. [30] developed the leaf temperature-measuring instrument,\
    \ using \ninfrared thermometry to measure leaf temperature to estimate leaf moisture\
    \ state. \nCanopy temperature relative to ambient air temperature is often used\
    \ to assess \nplant stress caused by moisture deficit or high temperature [31]\
    \ [32]. Continuous \nmeasurement of plant canopy temperature is useful in both\
    \ research and agricultural \nproduction. James R. Mahana et al. [33] studied\
    \ a low-cost infrared sensor based \nwireless temperature monitoring system, assessed\
    \ the system’s reliability and \nstability, and verified the feasibility of low-cost\
    \ infrared temperature measurement \nsystem. O'Shaughnessy et al. [34] developed\
    \ a wireless sensor system comprised \nmainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples\
    \ located on a center pivot lateral and in \nthe field below to monitor crop canopy\
    \ temperatures. Daniel K. Fisher et al. [35] \ndeveloped and constructed a low-cost\
    \ microcontroller based system to monitor the \ntemperature and the water status\
    \ of crop. The system can realize automatic \nmeasurement of canopy temperature,\
    \ soil temperature, air temperature, and soil \nmoisture status in field. It includes\
    \ a digital infrared temperature sensor, choose \nMLX90614 (Melexis. Concord.\
    \ NH) infrared temperature module to get the plant \ncanopy (leaf) temperature.\
    \ The precision of the system is 0.3 degrees Celsius by \nexperiments. \n3.3 \n\
    Others \nCrop yield is the result of many factors, is the important data of the\
    \ variable \nassignment management [36]. Commercialized grain yield monitor systems\
    \ are \nmainly the AFS (advanced farming system) system (CASE IH Corporation,\
    \ U.S.), the \nFieldStar system (AGCO Corporation, British), the Greenstar system\
    \ (JohnDeree \nCorporation, USA), the PF (precision farming) system (AgLeader\
    \ Corporation, USA), \nthe production monitoring system of RDS, etc. All these\
    \ systems are equipped with \nGPS positioning system, can automatically monitor\
    \ crop production and make a crop \nyield map. Cereal production yield monitor\
    \ sensor is the core of these systems, \nincluding the photoelectric volumetric\
    \ flow sensor, the γ-ray impulse flow sensor and \nthe impulse type flow sensor\
    \ [3]. Some portable information collection and \ntransmission systems have combined\
    \ with GPS, GPRS or Zigbee technology, were \nbuilt to obtain pictures, sounds,\
    \ numbers, GPS information or any other data of field \ncrops [37-40].  \n4 \n\
    Discussions and Conclusions \n4.1 \nCrop Information Acquisition \nThere have\
    \ been many associated reports about rapid detection methods and \ninstruments\
    \ of the nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, and moisture content. And \nthere\
    \ are also some reports about detection methods of phosphorus and potassium \n\
    content. But the report about crop trace information is less. This is mainly because\
    \ the \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n211 \n \nmain crop\
    \ trace information is metal elements based, and their content is low. The \n\
    ordinary sensing technology still not meets the requirements, and the use of spectrum\
    \ \nand spectral imaging technologies doesn’t directly react to metal element\
    \ information. \n4.2 \nThe Core Technologies \n• GPS \nFarmland location information,\
    \ which including latitude, longitude, shape and size \nof farmland, is mainly\
    \ obtained through GPS (global positioning system). GPS \ntechnology is currently\
    \ widely used in agricultural crop information acquisition \nsystems, can be combined\
    \ with crop information to make crop distribution map. \n• Multi-sensor information\
    \ fusion technology \nMulti-sensor information fusion technology is a comprehensive\
    \ automated \ninformation processing technology [41]. The use of real-time multi-sensor\
    \ \ninformation fusion technology has become a new hot spot to simultaneously\
    \ measure \nmultiple parameters [42]. \n• Wireless communication technology \n\
    Wireless communication can be classified as long-distance communication (GSM,\
    \ \nGPRS, etc.) and short-range communications (Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.)\
    \ [43]. \nGSM and GPRS, based on mobile communication network, can achieve remote\
    \ \nagricultural information acquisition and monitoring. Wireless sensor networks,\
    \ which \nhas developed in recent years, integrate sensor technology, embedded\
    \ technology, \nmodern networking and wireless communication technology. It can\
    \ achieve real-time \ndata transmission via low-power short-range wireless communications\
    \ technology \n(such as Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.). Farmland information\
    \ self-organizing \nwireless sensor network system can be established. \n• Multispectral\
    \ / Hyperspectral imaging technology \nAs spectroscopic technique is easily affected\
    \ by soil background, environment, \ncrop canopy structure, the obtained spectrum\
    \ signal is not able to completely react \ncrops truthful information. Multispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral imaging technology can \nmake up for these shortcomings [2].\
    \ The researches about multispectral and \nhyperspectral imaging technology used\
    \ in the crop phosphorus, potassium, and trace \ninformation are less. But there\
    \ are already reports about multi-spectral imaging \ntechnology applied to detect\
    \ the moisture content of crop leaves [44]. We had better \nestablish the quantitative\
    \ relationship between the spectral characteristics and crop \ngrowth/nutrition\
    \ information and develop crop information equipment. \n4.3 \nConclusion \nPA\
    \ is an information-based technology. PA can use crop information in the farmland\
    \ \nto control the arrangement of production inputs, maximize crop profit, and\
    \ minimize \nenvironmental impact. Information acquisition and processing plays\
    \ a very important \nrole in PA. As shown in table 1, after understanding crop\
    \ information acquisition \nmethods, combined with the current situation and development\
    \ trend, a structure \nabout crop information acquisition technology and sensing\
    \ instrument system is \nlisted. \n212 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \nTable 1. Crop information\

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010127\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\

    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\

    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\

    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    is a cross sectoral, multidisciplinary, integrated system engineering which takes
    biological engineering, agricultural engineering, environmental engineering, automatic
    control technology as a whole. In agriculture, through the computer debugging
    facility environment putting the environment in a suitable state could achieve
    the purpose of early maturity, high yield, high quality and high efficiency. In
    the cultivation mode of the facilities, the cultivation technology of nutrient
    solution is the focus of the recent two years. In some foreign countries which
    are advanced in the field of plant cultivation technology, more than 50% are using
    the method of water culture. They use the nutrient solution instead of the soil
    to cultivate the plant, provide different plants’ configures for different nutrient
    solutions, the purpose is to improve the mature time and increase the production.
    The pH value is the hydrogen ion concentration index in the liquid, which is an
    important indicator of plant nutrition. Now the foreign countries lead in the
    pH measuring equipment, for example, the Swiss Mettler Toledo and Italy Hanna
    instruments. The advantages are high accuracy, good stability, but the disadvantage
    is high price. So if we use these equipment in the greenhouse, it will bring a
    huge cost. In our country, we also have the similar equipment and the price is
    low, but in practical application, the disadvantage is poor stability, poor accuracy
    and high energy consumption. Moreover, the conditioning circuit is complex through
    the high performance operational amplifier to make isolating, amplifying and filtering
    circuit to complete the acquisition of pH signals. In 2013, on the basis of Arduino,
    Bin Jun completed the pH measurement with the function of automatic temperature
    compensation and high accuracy, but the circuit is rather complex. In 2011, Zhang
    Jiaxing designed a kind of automatic pH measurement system. The circuit design
    is simple, however, the host computer software was designed to complete the pH
    monitoring, which caused the networking level is low and maintaining is not easy.
    Du Zhiguo puts forward the remote real time water quality monitoring system architecture
    based on combination of Zigbee wireless sensor network and Internet, which realizes
    the acquisition and transmission of water quality monitoring parameters, but the
    volume is large and the cost is expensive. So it’s not suitable for large area
    applications. However, along with the application of wireless sensor networks
    in the field of agriculture, WiFi sensor has been widely used in the field of
    environmental monitoring with the advantages of high transmission speed, strong
    anti-interference ability, strong compatibility. It has become one of the important
    means of communication in facility agriculture. In recent years, with the development
    of internet of things and cloud services technology, Baidu, Ali, Tencent have
    launched their own cloud platforms. Instead of PC, the cloud platform improves
    the speed of data processing. When the device needs to be upgraded, developers
    just need to upgrade the cloud at the far end instead of manually upgrading each
    equipment. The cloud platform not only improves the efficiency of the work, but
    also reduces the labor cost. Therefore, after analyzing the existing problems
    of pH monitoring equipment, this paper based on cloud platform proposes the design
    of pH monitoring equipment, including the hardware design, the communication among
    equipment and the cloud and the rapid development of the Android. The purpose
    is to improve the accuracy and stability of pH monitoring equipment in our country
    and to strengthen the degree of network management. 2 Principle and System Architecture
    of PH Measurement 2.1 The Architecture of pH Measurement System The pH monitoring
    system designed in this paper uses low power, low cost, high speed wireless communication
    mode for real-time data transmission. And it also provides a simple, intuitive
    management platform to complete the management of wireless sensor, environmental
    information storage and analysis of processing functions for the users. The system
    structure diagram is shown in Fig. 1 in four parts, including pH measurement equipment
    (monitoring nodes), wireless routers, cloud platforms, mobile terminals. Fig.
    1. Structure of the system Full size image Monitoring Node: Composed of the WiFi
    sensor for monitoring pH in greenhouse nutrient solution. It is mainly responsible
    for acquiring pH value, timely sending data to the cloud server and completing
    the management function of the sensor power supply. Using WiFi to transmit data
    is to eliminate the difficulties in the wiring of the greenhouse. Wireless Router:
    Mainly to complete the function of wireless network coverage and providing WiFi
    network connectivity with the cloud. Cloud Service Platform: Bottom is composed
    of a huge number of servers and virtualization management software, when the devices
    access the cloud platform, firstly. Secondly, compared with the traditional PC,
    the speed of analysis and processing data is greatly improved; Finally, it saves
    the cost of the enterprise to build their own servers and the power consumption
    of the server operation. Mobile Terminal: It can enrich the way of environmental
    monitoring. Whenever and Wherever you are, you can see the environmental information
    in the greenhouse by cell phone and PC. In the PC side, managers can directly
    enter the cloud platform through the login page to view information in real time,
    reducing the tedious tasks like software development and software maintenance.
    2.2 pH Measurement Principle of Nutrient Solution The composition of nutrient
    solution is more complex in protected cultivation. It not only contains the main
    nutrients needed for crop growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium
    and so on, but also contains the necessary trace elements of crop growth. So,
    it’s difficult to monitor all the nutrients. We just need to monitor several indicators
    of the nutrient solution, such as pH and EC. And then through the hardware facilities
    to adjust the environmental conditions, it would meet the needs of the crop growth.
    According to this we can see that the accuracy and stability of the pH value is
    critical. PH is a kind of scale of hydrogen ion activity in the solution. Its
    formula is: $$ pH = - Log\left[ {H + } \right] $$ At present, the calculation
    method of pH includes chemical analysis method, test paper method and potential
    method. Potential method is often used. The potential method uses glass electrode
    as indicating electrode and Ag/Agcl electrode as reference electrode. And then
    insert the two electrodes into measurement solution. They formed original battery
    and the two electrodes are respectively the positive and negative electrode of
    the original battery. According to the Nernst Equation, the relationship among
    the output electromotive force of the primary cell, the absolute temperature of
    the measured solution and the pH value of the measured solution is: $$ E = E0
    + KT\left( {pHx - pHs} \right) $$ E is the original battery output electromotive
    force; E0 and K are constants, E0 depends on the type and structure of the electrode
    sensor film, K is the coefficient of Nernst; T is the absolute temperature of
    the tested solution. pHx is the measured pH value of the solution. pHs is the
    pH value of the buffer solution in the composite glass electrode. According to
    the Nernst Equation we can know that the output electromotive force of the primary
    cell is produced by the interaction of the pH and the temperature of the solution.
    Therefore, if we can measure the output electromotive force of primary cell and
    the solution temperature, through the Nernst Equation, we could calculate the
    pH value of the solution. 3 Hardware Circuit Design The sensor node is the basic
    unit of the environmental monitoring system with the functions such as collection
    of environmental factors, data processing and signal communication. The hardware
    composition of WiFi sensor mainly includes pH composite electrode (used for measuring
    potential), sensor measuring potential analog front-end circuit LMP91200, STM32
    acquisition module and WiFi module (used for communicating between the equipment
    and cloud). Figure 2 is the hardware structure circuit. Fig. 2. Structure of system
    hardware circuit Full size image 3.1 pH Electrode The pH electrode, also known
    as the pH sensor, is a part of the pH device which is in contact with the material
    being tested and is used to measure the potential of the electrode. The PH electrode
    is mainly divided into two parts, the measurement electrode and the reference
    electrode. When placed in the liquid, they formed battery system. And then we
    could calculate the pH through the difference between the two electrode voltages.
    Now, most of the electrodes are combined together with the measuring electrode
    and the reference electrode, which named pH composite electrode. Taking into account
    the harsh environment of agriculture, this paper selected the Taiwan HAOSHI pH
    electrode which is used in the industrial field. This electrode is used in the
    German industrial manufacturing technology. The pressure is 0.6 MP. It can be
    applied to a variety of conditions of pH measurement. The characteristics are
    fast response and good thermal stability. It also can be directly related to the
    use of various pH instruments. Moreover, this pH electrode has a high measurement
    accuracy by using PT100 thermal resistance for the temperature compensation. 3.2
    Sensor Analog Front End Circuit The Sensor analog front end circuit used in this
    paper is LMP91200 which is produced as the first integrated pH circuit by TI.
    The role of LMP91200 is to connect the pH electrode with the micro controller,
    so as to complete the pH measurement. The LMP91200 is designed for 2-electrode
    sensors and works over a voltage range of 1.8 V to 5.5 V, so it can be connected
    with a variety of different operating voltage microprocessors. The LMP91200 has
    low input bias and it is feasible that an external Pt1000, Pt100, or similar temperature
    sensor is integrated in the LMP91200, thus this device has a high precision. Figure
    3 is the structure circuit of LMP91200. Fig. 3. Structure circuit of LMP91200
    Full size image VDD and VREF to provide 3.3 V voltage for the chip. CSB, SCLK,
    SDI and SD0_DIAG are the SPI pins for connecting processor. You can achieve different
    functions through it. RTD as a temperature pin connected with the Pt100, the control
    of this feature is available through the SPI interface. CAL connecting with 100Ω
    precision resistor is responsible for the calibration of temperature measurement
    mode. The BNC interface respectively connects the composite electrode with the
    pins of INP and VCM in LMP91200. The temperature and pH measurement voltage signals
    are output through the VOUT pin to the STM32ADC channel for A/D conversion. In
    pH measurement, through the SPI interface the microcontroller sends different
    commands to control the LMP91200 different working modes. One is temperature measurement
    mode and the other is pH measurement mode. In the temperature measurement mode,
    first of all, the current is produced by the chip through the CAL and RTD resistance
    separately. Secondly, the voltage generated by the temperature detector is programmable
    through the PGA amplifier and finally output by the VOUT interface. Therefore,
    when calculating the temperature, we should write the control words, which come
    from the measurement of the RTD and CAL voltage, into the LMP91200. And then through
    the relative formula we could calculate the temperature value for temperature
    compensation. In measuring the pH mode INP inputs pressure signals, which are
    acquired from the composite pH electrode, into the unit gain buffer-pH buffer
    and then output separately by VOUT. The resistance of the pH composite electrode
    is high. So the receiver must have matched resistance. pH buffer has high input
    resistance and low bias electricity which reduces the measurement error while
    receiving the voltage signals. For VCM both the programming control voltage and
    different external input voltage are available. 3.3 Data Acquisition Module The
    core of the Data acquisition module is STM32F103C8T6 chip. The chip is based on
    the 32 bit Cortex-M3 kernel microcontroller and supports 72 MHz operating frequency.
    Meanwhile, it also integrates Flash 64 KB and SRAM 512 KB. The chip is rich in
    IIC, USART, SPI, ADC and other resources. In this system, we use the 12 bit STM32F103C8T6
    of ADC to complete the analog digital conversion of the pH output voltage and
    through the WiFi module serial communication to complete the function of the data
    transmission to the cloud. 3.4 WiFi Communication Module This module is mainly
    characterized by the Shanghai Hanfeng MCU autonomous development platform, cost-effective,
    support AP+STA two wireless interface. AP that is Wireless Access Point, means
    wireless access point. The wireless router is AP and other devices can be connected
    to each other by AP. STA is short by Station, which is like wireless terminal.
    The module can access the router through the STA and connected to the server via
    TCP. The HF-LPB100 supports AP+STA two interface modes. When in use, as AP for
    mobile phones or PC access and through the STA interface WiFi also can connect
    the router to complete the data upload. So the efficiency is greatly improved.
    HF-LPB100 also has the characteristics of small size, low power consumption (3.3
    V power supply, the average power consumption is 0.03 W), supports serial transparent
    transmission mode. The RXD and TXD of the WiFi module is connected with the STM32
    serial port to accomplish the serial communication, meanwhile, the reset, connection
    and the preparation interface is connected with the STM32 GPIO, so the microcontroller
    sends control commands to ensure the work of WiFi module. 4 Software Design 4.1
    System Software Design The application of this system is written in C language,
    compiled under MDK5.14 software, including the main function, pH acquisition program
    design, as well as WiFi and MCU serial communication protocol three aspects. After
    the completion of the electrical initialization on the device, you should choose
    Airlink or Softap to access the could when the WiFi is first access the network.
    The Airlink model is a collective name of SmartConfig and SmartLink, which is
    compatible with a number of WiFi vendor communication protocols and the WiFi devices
    of smart cloud have been built in this feature, but it doesn’t support the 5G
    signal. Softap model is the supplement of Airlink. In this mode, the device becomes
    a AP. The mobile phone can be directly connected with the WiFi device, and then
    enter the router account number, password. The device will automatically connect
    the router. When the device is connected to the cloud, it will be under the cyclic
    working state. The WiFi module every 1′30′′ will send the reading MCU state instructions,
    and every 10 min MCU will automatically upload data. Figure 4 is the overall software
    flow chart. Fig. 4. Software flow chart Full size image 4.2 pH Acquisition Program
    Design The MCU writes the LMP91200 control words through the SPI communication
    mode: 0x6880, 0xE880, 0xA880. By writing 0xA880, 0xE880 to get the Pt100 the voltage
    value of the calibration resistance and PGA magnification, then calculate the
    solution temperature according to the PT100 and the calibrated resistance terminal
    voltage. The formula is: $$ I\_true = (VOUT\_CAL)/(PGA \times R1) = VOUT\_CAL/(10
    \times 100) $$ (1) $$ R\_RTD = (VOUT\_RTD)/(PGA \times I\_true) $$ (2) $$ R\_RTD
    = R_{0} (1 + \alpha T) $$ (3) In the formula (1), VOUT_CAL is the calibration
    of the output voltage on the resistor R1, I_true is the actual current flowing
    through the resistor R1, PGA is a preset programmable gain amplification, the
    value is 10. In the formula (2), R_RTD is PT100, VOUT_RTD is the output voltage
    of it. In the formula (3), R0 is the resistance of PT100 in the 0 °C, the value
    is 100, α is thermal conductivity, the value is 0.00390802. After the temperature
    measurement, writing 0x6880 to the LMEP91200 chip for the pH measurement, then
    get the A/D conversion voltage, finally, calculating the solution pH by the Nernst
    equation. The formula is: $$ E = E_{0} - S \times pH $$ (4) $$ S = RT/F = 54.20
    + 0.1984*T $$ (5) In the formula (4), E is the output voltage of pH electrode,
    the value is VOUT_pH minus 1/2Vref, VOUT_pH is the output voltage of LMP91200,
    Vref is the reference voltage; E0 is the reference electrode voltage, it is a
    fixed value related to the pH electrode; R is gas constant; T is absolute temperature;
    F is Faraday constant. For the accurate measurement, this paper uses the standard
    solution (25C, pH for 4 and 6.86) to the calibration. $$ E_{1} = E_{0} - S \times
    6.86 $$ (6) $$ E_{2} = E_{0} - S \times 4.00 $$ (7) Combined formula (4) and (5):
    $$ \begin{array}{*{20}c} {S = \left( {E2 - E1} \right)/\left( {pH1 - pH2} \right)}
    \\ {E0 = \left( {E2*pH1 - E1*pH2} \right)/\left( {pH1 - pH2} \right)} \\ \end{array}
    $$ Then bringing the S and E0 to the pH calculation equation. Figure 5 is the
    measurement of pH software flow chart. Fig. 5. Software flow chart of pH measurement
    Full size image 4.3 The Serial Communication Between MCU and WiFi The way of the
    serial communication between MCU and WiFi is asking and answering. The normal
    cycling state of MCU mainly includes four parts, the occurrence of the button,
    WiFi sending query commands, control commands and a heartbeat command. The design
    of software prescribes that when the MCU or WiFi module sends commands to each
    other, the other party must return the response. If the sender has received no
    response to the instruction for 200 ms, it will be resend. The key event is used
    to select the mode of the network. The query commands are used to monitor the
    MCU state value. The control command is used for the WiFi module to send the control
    MCU instructions. The heartbeat command is used to monitor the communication between
    WiFi module and MCU whether is normal or not. If the MCU didn’t receive the heartbeat
    for 180 ms, it will determine the communication failed, and then restart WiFi
    automatically. Table 1 is the transmission format of WiFi module to obtain MCU
    data. Table 2 is the transmission format of MCU response WiFi module. Table 1.

    2. The transmission format of MCU response WiFi module Full size table 5 The Access
    of Cloud Platform and Mobile Terminal Development 5.1 The Access of Cloud Platform
    The WiFi module and the cloud completed a physical connection through the wireless
    router. In terms of data communication, the mqtt communication protocol code and
    network firmware are embedded into the WiFi module so that it can transmit data
    to the cloud according to specified format. To standardize and simplify the development
    of the equipment business logic protocol, a common data point protocol is developed
    for the interaction among devices, cloud, and APP. The advantage is that the cloud
    can analyze the data based on it, mobile APP can resolve the device data when
    they are in sending and reporting, MCU can complete the development based on the
    generated communication protocol. So, to the developers, you just need to edit
    the data points in the new individual project and define the data type, then it
    will accomplish the communication between the device and cloud. 5.2 Rapid Development
    of APP The gizwits provides some SDK packages for Android and IOS development,
    which has packaged some functions such as the network configuration, discovery,
    connection, control, heartbeat and state reporting etc. And also, in the gizwits
    official website, there are some open templates, so the developers can quickly
    complete the development of APP according to it. This system is mainly for the
    development of Android mobile phone, mainly divided into the following four steps.
    (1) Build Android development environment, download eclipse software and import
    pet house open source. Create the own project on the official website of gizwits
    and download the SDK package (including jar.so and so.so), then replace the jar.so
    and so.so in the LIBS files. (2) Get the Productkey in the creating project, meanwhile,
    bounding the android application and get the APPID. Productkey is the only number
    of smart cloud database, when the developers complete the development of the MCU,
    through the Productkey gizwits can identify the device and automatically complete
    the registration. The function of APPID is to associate the intelligent applications
    with the device. In the source code to create a new class APPlication used to
    inherit the native APPlication class, then initialize the device APPID in it and
    initialize theProductkey in MessageCenter file. (3) Opening all the SDK log print
    level in the AndroidManifest.xml and allowing APP to communicate with the cloud.
    Registering SDK listener, using to callback the interfaces which have defined
    in the SDK, such as registration, login, configuration equipment, binding device.
    (4) Design the UI, add the identity name of data point in the GokitControlActivity
    function, add the BindingDeviceActivity to callback the binding device. So, the
    APP development finished. 6 Experimental Test 6.1 Function Test The test is mainly
    to verify the accuracy of the measurement and the completion of the function.
    The comparison between theoretical value and measured value of pH was carried
    out by experiments. Not only that, the test uses the APP and PC to login the cloud
    to verify whether the WiFi sensor can accurately and stably upload data to the
    cloud. The choice of pH solution is the standard buffer solution (pH = 4.00),
    which is produced by Tianjin Hengxing Chemical Reagent company. Figure 6 is the
    physical map of the system. Figure 7 is the APP value and the cloud value. Fig.
    6. The physical map of the system Full size image Fig. 7. The APP value and the
    cloud value Full size image In the test, set the WiFi sensor every 1′30′′ to upload
    a MCU data, and every 10 min MCU upload data automatically. Figure 7(b) shows:
    in the 20:04, 20:14 and 20:24, in addition to MCU in response to the WiFi module
    to upload a data, the MCU initiative to upload a data, however, other times are
    every 1′30′′ to complete a upload. Figure 7(b) is the APP value. The test shows
    that the system can accurately and quickly realize the function of real-time query
    on Data in the mobile phone and cloud. 6.2 Sensor Proof Reading Test After functional
    test, this paper does the sensor proof reading test, using this sensor to measure
    the standard pH solution made by State Administration of quality supervision one
    hour, get the actual measured value and the proof value, each has 45 sets of data.
    Then comparing this to the standard value is to observe its accuracy and stability.
    The PH value of solution is 4.00, 6.86, 9.18. Figure 8 is the pH data chart. Fig.
    8. pH data chart Full size image In Fig. 8 A is a standard solution of pH 4.00.
    B is a standard solution of pH 6.86, C is a standard solution of pH 9.18. The
    datas shows that whether it calibrate or not, the data are generally in the range
    of 0.08, have a high stability, besides, the calibrated curve is evenly distributed
    in the standard value. The measurement accuracy can be 0.01, compared to the majority
    of pH testing instruments. The accuracy has improved. 6.3 Network Transmission
    Test Network transmission test makes the WiFi sensor run for 10 h, then through
    the communication log of gizwits official website to observe the accuracy and
    stability. Figure 9 is the interactive information chart of APP and cloud. Fig.
    9. The interactive information chart of APP and cloud Full size image After a
    long time running, there was no off-line condition, every 1′30′′, the device regularly
    sends data to the cloud for totally 400 times and every ten minutes MCU initiatively
    uploads data for totally 60 times. So the MCU sends 465 times to the cloud. According
    to Fig. 9, there are 465 communications and the success rate is 100%. At 20:58,
    there are two communications, one is the MCU response upload, the other is the
    MCU active upload. 7 Conclusion In this paper, by analyzing the problems existing
    in the pH monitoring in china and abroad and the development trend of the future,
    we design a device used for the pH measurement. The function is feasible that
    the data will be transmitted to the gizwits platform and monitored in real time
    through accessing both mobile phone app and website login cloud. The experimental
    results show that this device has a high accuracy, and can quickly complete the
    data upload, meanwhile it solve the problems of low intelligence, network management
    is not scientific in the domestic pH monitoring equipment, the research results
    have a certain practicability. References Zou, Y., Hang, H.: High precision pH

  Explanation: **1. Yes.** The research team controlled for water availability by exposing juvenile cork oak seedlings to four different watering regimens: 100, 50, 25, and 10 % of soil water holding capacity. Statistically significant differences in a variety of physiological traits were found across water availability treatments, indicating that seedlings adjusted their physiological performance accordingly. Moreover, seedlings from different locations (populations) showed different sensitivities to water limitation, suggesting that they are locally adapted to distinct water availabilities in their native environments.

**2. Yes.** The research team addressed this question by investigating the relationship between water use efficiency, expressed as carbon isotope discrimination levels, and drought tolerance, measured as aboveground biomass production, across the different populations and watering treatments. Their results suggest that the southernmost populations had higher water use efficiency and greater biomass production than northern populations, particularly when subjected to extreme water limitation. This suggests that the southernmost populations are more drought-tolerant and better adapted to drier conditions.

**3. Yes, in part.** The research team assessed three main parameters related to drought tolerance: (1) foliar morphological traits (leaf size and shape), (2) physiological responses (e.g., photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance), and (3) biochemical responses (e.g., levels of compatible solutes and malondialdehyde). Statistically significant variation was found among the three reproductive strategies for most of the leaf morphological traits, with northern populations generally having more drought-tolerant leaf traits than southern populations. For the physiological and biochemical traits, the research team only found significant differences among populations for a subset of the traits investigated. These results suggest that local adaptation to drought may have evolved differently for different traits in cork oak, with foliar morphological traits showing a more consistent pattern of local adaptation than physiological and biochemical traits.

**Explore the potential of cognitive radio networks and dynamic spectrum access for optimizing wireless communication in the presence of interference and congestion**

In this task, the researcher is asked to study the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing wireless communication in the presence of interference and congestion. CRNs and DSA are two promising technologies that have been proposed to address the challenges of interference and congestion in wireless networks. CRNs allow nodes to cognitively learn about the spectrum environment and adapt their transmission parameters accordingly. DSA allows nodes to dynamically access spectrum that is not being used by licensed users.

CRNs and DSA can be combined to create a powerful wireless communication system that is able to exploit the spectrum more efficiently and avoid interference. This can lead to improved throughput, reduced latency, and increased capacity. CRNs and DSA are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we use wireless communication.

  Main Objective: The primary goal of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, automated irrigation management systems with a focus on end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Survey data
  Technologies Used: fluid dispersion device
  Key Findings: The use of a fixed water dispersion device for impact sprinklers can improve water distribution under low-pressure conditions, resulting in more uniform wetting of the soil while minimizing runoff and loss of irrigation water.
  Extract 1: There are several ways to improve the water distribution of sprinklers under a low pressure.  For example, an orifice nozzle, non-circular nozzles, vanes and fluidic devices can be installed on these sprinklers[30,31].  Li et al. developed a fluidic sprinkler based on the principle of “coanda effect” where water flows from the nozzle into a tube installed in the fluidic component to form low pressure area[32].  Although this application improved the water distribution, but there are still some difficulties in relation to the uniformity of rotation of the fluidic sprinkler.
  Extract 2: These nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams that apply water more slowly and uniformly than conventional sprays and rotors, particularly when adjusted for specific site conditions (Figure 1).  In addition to reducing water use, the water jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less likely to mist, and significantly reduces run-off on the irrigated field.  Rotating nozzles compliment that simple principle.   Rotating nozzles for pop up spray heads apply water much Not all pop-up spray head bodies are compatible with these nozzles.   However, the compatibility list is available for check with the nozzle manufacturers directly, while the weather decides when the sprinklers come on to save water.
  Limitations: 1) Previous researches concentrated more on determining ETcrop using crop water uses under no stress conditions with no consideration for annual and perennial crops under different growth stages and stress conditions.   
2) For ETcrop controllers to be fully effective, the existing sprinkler irrigation system must be operated and maintained properly.  How water savings estimates obtained from field trials be extrapolated to other areas with very different characteristics and/or weather patterns still remains under researched.
3) Water saved between weather-based and soil-moisture based “smart” controller, and how these circumstances favor one over the other are currently not known.  Field evaluations report water saved in terms of percent reduction per crop without providing any sense for how these savings varied by different crop characteristics, such as total water use, irrigated area, longevity of saving, and level of wasteful irrigation prior to the retrofit.  Without such information, however, others cannot extrapolate a study’s results to their own service areas.

The data storage layer is responsible for storing the data for further analytics and long-term data management. The microservices layer is responsible for managing every data transaction and can have independent databases and/or data models. The applications layer is responsible for interacting with the beekeepers to deliver monitoring, management, and event notification features. Finally, the user layer is composed of the beekeepers as the main stakeholders of the system.

Bozorg-Haddad (Ed.), Essential tools for water resources analysis, planning, and management (pp. 59–83). Springer Water. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-4295-8_3
  Main Objective: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: survey data, Interviews, Case studies, Literature review
  Technologies Used: None
  Key Findings: Water information and data bases are used for addressing environmental, physical, social, political, economic, and ecological issues of water supply, consumption, availability, and accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources management, such as flood risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir operation, and water sanitation require incorporation of different types of water information for efficient planning and decision making.
  Extract 1: The generated water information should be combined with infrastructure and institution in order to reach an efficient water resources planning and management for both the current and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018).
  Extract 2: The main nine steps of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data life cycle (Adopted from NSF DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation and planning: needs of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations are performed; Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to analyse the data quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately described using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival: data should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre); Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained; Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis: data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described, managed, and made accessible.
  Limitations: None
  Relevance Evaluation: The paper outlines the importance of metadata in water resources management. Metadata is defined as additional information that describes the raw water data. Metadata makes it possible for decision makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities. By understanding when water data was collected, managers can better infer what factors contributed to the measurements.
  Relevance Score: 0.9
  Inline Citation: (Jahanddideh-Tehrani, Bozorg-Haddad & Daliakopoulos, 2021)
  Explanation: Metadata is the use of other information to interpret data.  For example, to interpret information about the relative acidity or alkalinity of a water source, we need to know when the sample was collected. The time the water sample was collected is metadata. By knowing the time the water sample was collected we can use other data sources, such as local weather data or population data, to infer what factors might have contributed to the measured acidity or alkalinity.

  Relevance Score: 0.7
  Inline Citation: (Nabwire et al., 2021)
  Explanation: Metadata, in this context, refers to information about the plant images that is not directly related to the plant's physical characteristics, such as the imaging device used, the date and time the image was taken, and the environmental conditions. This information can be used to ensure that the images are properly calibrated and processed, and to help interpret the results of the image analysis.

The specific relevance of metadata to the study of plant phenomics lies in its ability to provide context and enable better data interpretation and decision-making. For example, knowing the imaging device used can help to correct for any distortions or biases in the image, and knowing the date and time the image was taken can help to account for any changes in the plant's appearance due to diurnal or seasonal variations. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, can also affect the appearance of plants in images, so knowing these conditions can help to control for their effects.

Overall, metadata is an important consideration in plant phenomics because it can provide valuable information that can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of image analysis results. By providing context and enabling better data interpretation, metadata can help researchers to make more informed decisions about plant phenotyping and management.

  Key Findings: 
  Extract 1: For treatment T100, the temporal variability of average SWC in the root zone resulted in general more limited than the other two treatments, as a consequence of the higher irrigation volumes applied. The average SWCs ranged between 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.30 cm3 cm−3, except that for short periods when they were slightly lower. This circumstance evidences that the average soil water content of the soil profile was generally higher than field capacity (SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3), with values sometimes close to saturation.
  Extract 2: Fig. 9a shows the measured Midday Stem Water Potential (absolute values), MSWP, as a function of the simulated water stress coefficient, Ks, during the periods of water restriction, whereas Fig. 9b illustrates the comparison between cumulated water stress integrals evaluated according to measured MSWP (Scum,MSWP) and simulated Ks (Scum,FAO-56), based on a weekly time step.

  Extract 1: The TSEB model is a physically-based model that is used to estimate land surface fluxes. It is a two-source model, which means that it takes into account the different temperatures of the vegetation and soil surfaces. The model was modified in this study to run at two different spatial resolutions. One resolution used a coarse thermal sensor and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30 m resolution. The other resolution used higher resolution thermal and optical sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at 10–20 m resolution.

  Explanation: The Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model splits the directional radiometric land surface temperature into temperatures of vegetation and soil while estimating the net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of vegetation and soil separately before combining them to obtain the bulk surface fluxes. The model was modified and run at two different spatial resolutions, one using a coarse thermal sensor and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30 m resolution and the other using higher resolution thermal and optical sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at 10–20 m resolution. This was done in order to investigate the effect of environmental factors, such as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on wireless data transmission. The high-resolution output from both runs were then compared to see how the model captures temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.

  Explanation: In this paper, the authors present a cooperative, distributed spectrum sensing approach for use in a cognitive radio network (CRN) with varying conditions. They take a parameter estimation approach to the spectrum sensing problem and use the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method based on the diffusion strategy under multiple frequency bands and investigate its efﬁciency and robustness in the presence of changes in the sensing environment, including interference and congestion.

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ATC diffusion-based method in more challenging and practical scenarios, where some frequency bands stop being utilized by some primary users (PUs), or where there is a mobile SU node in the network. The authors consider a network of three static PUs with overlapping power spectrums and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed SUs that communicate via a connected network. The network is divided into different frequency zones, and each SU is interested in a subset of these zones. The PUs cease to use some of the frequent zones during different time intervals, and one of the SUs becomes mobile and changes position and frequency bands of interest over time.

The authors analyze the performance of the ATC method by monitoring the estimation error of the involved parameters that approximate the total power spectrum. They evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the ATC method in estimating the global and common interest parameter vectors and compare its performance with a non-cooperative LMS algorithm. Their results show that the ATC method outperforms the non-cooperative LMS algorithm, and that the use of adaptive combination weights further improves the estimation accuracy.

The work presented in this paper is relevant to the review intention as it provides a detailed analysis of the performance of a cooperative, distributed spectrum sensing approach under realistic and challenging conditions. The authors have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach and have provided insights into its behavior under different scenarios.

This automated and real-time irrigation management allows farmers to remotely monitor and manage their irrigation systems, optimizing water usage and crop productivity.

Paper 1:
- APA Citation: 
  Main Objective: 
  Study Location: 
  Data Sources: 
  Technologies Used: 
  Key Findings: 
  Extract 1: System models are graph models. Existing methods use various system models. We can distinguish, for example:

- Task Graph (TG): one of the simplest and most popular methods of representing functions at the system level. It is a directed acyclic graph in which nodes represent tasks and edges represent the order in which tasks are performed (usually representing transmissions). The task is activated when all preceding ones are completed. In this way, sequential dependencies between tasks are presented. Transmission volumes are represented by edge weights. A sample task graph is shown in Figure 1. The graph describes a six-task system. Tasks on the same path in the graph are sequentially executed, while tasks from parallel paths can be executed in parallel. Extended versions of task graphs can also be found in the literature, e.g., conditional task graphs and multimodal task graphs [50,51].

- Synchronization Data Flow (SDF) or Static Data Flow (SSDF): models representing data flow (often used in modeling telecommunications applications). Like the TG, SDF is a directed graph. Unlike the TG, cycles can occur in SDF. The synchronization mechanism is described by determining the number of tags generated by the execution of a given task (for each output edge). The number of tags taken from each input is also specified for each task. The task is activated if the required number of tags is available on all inputs.

  Explanation: The proposed methodology is based on relative precedence of tasks determined in the functional specifications, as well as past research findings on system synthesis. The precedence constraints represent which tasks must be performed before others, and the real-time requirements of the system determine the amount of time that can elapse between the start and completion of each task.

The proposed methodology includes four steps: 

1. **Functional specification** - The first step is to develop a functional specification of the system. This specification should include a description of the system's purpose, the tasks that need to be performed, and the real-time requirements of the system.
2. **Mapping the functional specification to the IoT architecture** - The next step is to map the functional specification to the IoT architecture. This involves identifying which tasks will be performed on which devices and how the devices will communicate with each other. 
3. **Scheduling the tasks** - Once the functional specification has been mapped to the IoT architecture, the tasks need to be scheduled. This involves determining the order in which the tasks will be performed and the amount of time that will be allocated to each task.
4. **Optimizing the system** - The final step is to optimize the system. This involves finding the best possible schedule for the tasks and the best possible configuration for the devices. The goal of optimization is to minimize the amount of time that elapses between the start and completion of each task while ensuring that all of the real-time requirements of the system are met.

  Explanation: MQTT and RTPS are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

MQTT is a lightweight protocol that is designed for low-power devices. It is simple to implement and has a low overhead. MQTT is best suited for applications that require low latency and high throughput, such as sensor data collection and remote control.

RTPS is a more robust protocol that is designed for high-reliability applications. It is more complex to implement than MQTT, but it provides features such as guaranteed delivery and message ordering. RTPS is best suited for applications that require high reliability and low latency, such as industrial automation and medical devices.

In general, MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency.

  Main Objective: Explore the use of advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, for non-invasive plant stress detection
Validate the ability of aerial UAV-based and hyperspectral imaging to discriminate and rank susceptible and tolerant sugar beet cultivars and predict nematode population and final yield.
  Study Location: Ober-Flörsheim, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany
  Data Sources: Reflectance measurements
  Technologies Used: Hyperspectral, Thermography, UAV, Field spectrometry
  Key Findings: 
  Extract 1: SIs extracted from the hyperspectral imager were able to differentiate between the two types of cultivars from group C. After 102 days, the main differences between susceptible and tolerant cultivars were related to biomass (NDVI), chlorophyll content of the leaves (780/700, CHLG) and general stress (HI). At 152 das, susceptible cultivars could also be differentiated from the tolerant ones using the SIs related to water content (NDWI1650, NDWI).
  Extract 2: The SIs extracted from the UAV hyperspectral imager were not able to differentiate between the two types of cultivars from group C. However, CHLG and ANTH SIs allowed to differentiate cultivars after 102 and 152 das, respectively.
  Limitations: Results were somewhat specific to the region and cultivars used in the research.
Data obtained from the field spectrometer and the hyperspectral imager were not fully consistent, which is also reflected by the differences observed between PCA computed with ground and UAV data.

  Explanation: Precision phenotyping and remote sensing technology have shown great promise in rapidly and accurately evaluating plant performance in field trials. Hyperspectral imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a powerful tool due to its ability to collect data in multiple spectral bands, providing information about crop traits such as chlorophyll content, nitrogen status, and biomass. In this study, hyperspectral UAV imagery was used to assess the response of sugar beet cultivars to infection by the beet cyst nematode (BCN), Heterodera schachtii. The study aimed to determine whether hyperspectral data could be used to discriminate between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant cultivars and predict sugar yield, with the ultimate goal of improving breeding efforts for BCN resistance.

The study was conducted in a field trial with nine different sugar beet cultivars, representing a range of susceptibility to BCN. Hyperspectral data were collected at two time points during the growing season using a UAV-mounted hyperspectral imager. The data were used to calculate a number of spectral vegetation indices (SIs), which are mathematical combinations of reflectance values at different wavelengths that are known to be related to specific plant traits. The SIs were then used to train machine learning algorithms to classify the cultivars according to their susceptibility to BCN and to predict sugar yield. The results showed that hyperspectral data could be used to discriminate between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant cultivars with high accuracy. The SIs that were most useful for discrimination included those related to chlorophyll content, nitrogen status, and biomass. 

The study also found that hyperspectral data could be used to predict sugar yield with reasonable accuracy. The SIs that were most useful for predicting yield were those related to chlorophyll content and biomass. The results of this study suggest that hyperspectral UAV imagery has the potential to be a valuable tool for improving breeding efforts for BCN resistance in sugar beet. Hyperspectral data can be used to rapidly and accurately assess the performance of different cultivars in field trials, and to identify promising candidates for further evaluation. This information can help breeders to develop new cultivars that are more resistant to BCN and more productive.

  Explanation: The study uses fog computing technology and machine learning algorithms to create an automated and real-time ECG monitoring system for patients with cardiovascular conditions, specifically rhythm disorders. Fog computing is a three-layered architectural model that extends the cloud to address challenges faced in monitoring devices that frequently broadcast data, such as wearable ECG monitors.

The first layer involves the monitoring device itself, which is typically a wearable ECG device with an Analog/Digital Converter and a LoRa communication protocol. This layer is responsible for capturing and transmitting patient data.

The second layer is the fog computing layer, where the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) processor and a Raspberry Pi are used. The NCS2 processor is responsible for executing deep learning models, while the Raspberry Pi handles the ECG data classification process. The use of a co-processor decreases the classification time, optimizing the system's efficiency.

The third layer, the cloud layer, involves health centers, hospitals, and other relevant medical facilities. Data is sent to the cloud if any cardiac anomalies are detected. Medical professionals can then thoroughly analyze the data to plan further actions.

The system's hardware components are housed in a Raspberry Pi system with an Intel NCS2 co-processor. Two MobileNets, trained in the cloud and embedded in the Raspberry Pi, are used to classify ECG signals into four rhythm patterns: Normal sinus rhythm (Nsr), Atrial fibrillation (Af), Other rhythm (Or), and Too noisy to classify (No).

The study used the dataset from the 2017 Computing in Cardiology Challenge to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. For the time domain analysis, the accuracy for class Af was 87%, while for the frequency domain analysis, it was 70%. Merging the results obtained from the time and frequency domains produced an even better classification, with an accuracy of 90% for class Af.

Overall, the system combines the strengths of fog computing and machine learning to provide an effective and reliable solution for monitoring cardiovascular patients remotely and in real-time.

The farmland system is a very complicated ecology system, involves different kinds of factors. Even the crop itself is a complicated system. The collecting of crop data usually incurs the substantial costs and technologies [4]. To understand the characteristic of crop information fully is very necessary. There are the characteristic of farmland crop information. A) Spatiality. The production of crop is associated with spatial factors. Every farmland has its own geographic location and boundaries. Spatial data is usually used in generating different maps as coordinates. B) Complexity. Any agricultural system has huge factors include not only directly related factors but also indirectly related factors. Each factor contains its sub-factors. Farmland crop data can be collected from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, handheld devices, remote sensing, satellite, history material, etc. Categories of data are diverse, including text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the information is changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time acquisition of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty of getting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable measurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data."

Crop water information is helpful to develop advanced and reliable monitoring equipment. Crop water status information collection technologies of crop individual include infrared temperature method, leaf water potential, spectral method, etc. Regional crop water status information is mainly obtained through remote sensing methods, including thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave remote sensing methods [28].

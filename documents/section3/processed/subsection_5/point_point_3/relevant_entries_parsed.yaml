    and Networking Conference (WCNC) (pp. 3083-3088). IEEE.
  data_sources: Disease leaf samples captured using different mobile devices at different
    resolutions
  explanation: The paper proposes a mobile-based system that captures and analyzes
    images of diseased plant leaves to aid in real-time disease diagnosis. The system
    employs a modified k-means clustering algorithm to segment the leaf image and
    identify the disease patch, focusing on minimizing data size and transmission
    time for improved efficiency. This approach aims to reduce the computational and
    communication costs associated with mobile-based plant disease diagnosis, making
    it more feasible for use in rural areas with limited connectivity.

    in the mobile device. The results obtained in our experiments show that the proposed
    method may be effectively used for reducing the total power consumption at the
    mobile end."'

- explanation: The study aims to evaluate the ability of GeoFIS to answer the most
    common issues and challenges faced by the agricultural sector when processing
    their spatial data. The authors achieve this by evaluating GeoFIS's ability to
    map the spatial variability in a data set, evaluate the opportunity for site-specific
    management and delineate within-field zones for variable rate applications.
  extract_1: '"GeoFIS has been designed to facilitate the movement from spatial data
    to spatial information, and to spatial decision-making. It is an open-source program
    that proposes a simple and easy to use interface to build decision support systems
    (DSS) from spatial data [30]. While its development has been inspired by agri-environmental
    applications, the framework itself is open and accessible to applications in other
    domains. It is designed to be adaptable to different usages and for different
    end-users, mostly for academic and research applications, for student and teaching
    applications and, to a lesser extent, for GIS-skilled agronomists and advisors."'
  extract_2: '"‘Precision Agriculture’ or ‘Smart Agriculture’ is only effective when
    effective decisions are made. End-users can transform these information layers
    into decision layers to improve the management of their fields. Three main functionalities
    for management (practical) applications have been incorporated within GeoFIS to
    address this. Firstly, practitioners are provided with a method to delineate within-field
    homogeneous zones (Step 3.1). Zoning is of importance for precision agriculture
    data as the identified zones will (i) facilitate spatial data visualization and
    interpretation, and (ii) provide a spatial resolution that is practical and effective
    for many differential field operations. GeoFIS uses a segmentation algorithm to
    ‘zone’ data layers [18]. The segmentation algorithm operates either on irregular
    or gridded (interpolated) data to generate potential management zones."'
  relevance_evaluation: 'This research is relevant to the point you are making in
    your literature review because it addresses the need for easy-to-use, open-source
    software that can be used by farmers and advisors to process spatial data from
    precision agriculture. The authors evaluate the ability of GeoFIS to perform three
    common tasks: mapping spatial variability, evaluating the opportunity for site-specific
    management, and delineating within-field zones for variable rate applications.'

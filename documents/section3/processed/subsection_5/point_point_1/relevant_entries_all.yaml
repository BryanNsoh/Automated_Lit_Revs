    \ to the city are not only material\nintelligence, but also because the smart\
    \ system is completed by the cooperation of human wisdom and the wisdom of things,\
    \ it\nis even more enhanced. There are various connections between people and\
    \ people and cities. In this paper, the construction of\nurban parks, its management,\
    \ and service requirements also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. However,\
    \ some\ntraditional urban parks cannot meet the new social needs. The application\
    \ of smart park systems in their renovation is an\nimportant way for urban parks\
    \ to rejuvenate and is an indispensable part of smart city construction. For urban\
    \ parks, the\nupgrade of smartization in the traditional park model is not only\
    \ an inevitable trend in the development of information\ntechnology but also an\
    \ important direction for the future construction of parks. The purpose of this\

    \ system in the renovation and renewal of urban parks, to discuss the\ncommon\
    \ problems and solutions faced in the renovation and renewal of urban parks today,\
    \ and to realize the renovation of\nthe smart park system of urban parks. And\

    \ Park and the interpretation of the existing problems, special transformation\
    \ is carried out under\nthe guidance of the smart park system according to the\
    \ existing problems, and the methods and systems of the application of\nthe smart\
    \ park system are summarized through practice. From a practical point of view,\
    \ the update design strategy proposed\nin this paper is tested.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Many cities take the construction of smart cities as a strate-\ngic choice for\
    \ transformation and development, setting oﬀ a\nboom in the construction of smart\
    \ cities [1]. With the rapid\ndevelopment of new-generation information technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud\ncomputing, as well\
    \ as their wide application in smart city\nconstruction, the management and service\
    \ needs of urban\nparks also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. The\nfunctional\
    \ layout, management methods, and service activi-\nties of many traditional urban\
    \ parks today cannot fully meet\nthe various needs of the current information\
    \ age [2]. How to\nmaintain urban green space such as urban parks can adapt\n\
    to the development of the age of wisdom, meet the current\nneeds of urban managers\
    \ and residents, and exert greater\necological beneﬁts are issues that need special\
    \ attention in\nthe development of urban parks. To become an indispens-\nable\
    \ part of smart city construction, the construction of\nurban parks must rely\
    \ on scientiﬁc and technological means\nto realize smart management and smart\
    \ services through the\nconstruction of smart park systems [3]. The goal of smart\n\
    operation and smart facilities is to lay a solid foundation\nfor the sustainable\
    \ development of urban parks.\nDue to changes in the society and environment,\
    \ our\nlandscape types have also become complex and diverse.\nHowever, because\
    \ the development of landscape architecture\ninformation technology in China is\
    \ relatively backward, the\ntheoretical system of digital chemistry has not yet\
    \ been\nformed, and the platform is weak, resulting in a lower\nHindawi\nJournal\
    \ of Sensors\nVolume 2023, Article ID 9188907, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9188907\n\
    threshold for the landscape architecture industry [4]. The\nmastery level is uneven,\
    \ the theory is not solid, the practical\nexperience is not rich enough, and there\
    \ is a lack of software\ntechnical talents. In addition, the project construction\
    \ period\nis generally shortened, and the designers cannot be like the\nancient\
    \ gardeners [5]. After the garden is completed and\nlanded, it will be continuously\
    \ adjusted through long-term\nobservation experience, so that the garden landscape\
    \ will\nreach a near-perfect state. Therefore, if we want to make\ngood use of\
    \ the beneﬁts of the development of the times\nand follow the pace of the times,\
    \ we should give priority to\nthe use of digital technology and the participation\
    \ of multi-\ndisciplinary professionals to help designers optimize the\ndesign\
    \ and make the landscape more scientiﬁc and ecologi-\ncal. The application of\
    \ smart park systems can greatly satisfy\nurban residents’ [6] travel needs. The\
    \ application of the\nsmart park system enables urban parks not only to better\n\
    play traditional functions such as ecological protection and\nscientiﬁc propaganda\
    \ and education but also to enhance\nthe landscape interaction of urban parks,\
    \ to use digital infor-\nmation technology to make the relationship between urban\n\
    parks and urban residents closer, to achieve the harmonious\ncoexistence of man\
    \ and nature, and to enhance the image of\nthe city and the happiness of residents’\
    \ life.\nThe connection between urban parks and urban resi-\ndents is very close,\
    \ and excellent urban parks can greatly\nimprove the quality of life of urban\
    \ residents. After decades\nof construction, development, management, and operation,\n\
    many urban parks have become indispensable green spaces\nin cities [7]. In view\
    \ of the problem that some traditional\nurban parks cannot meet the needs of current\
    \ urban resi-\ndents in a timely manner, these urban parks need to be\nupgraded\
    \ and updated intelligently to enhance the vitality\nof urban parks and to create\
    \ smart parks that meet the back-\nground of smart city construction. By applying\
    \ the smart\npark system to the renovation and reconstruction of some\ntraditional\
    \ urban parks, the image and service level of urban\nparks can be greatly improved\
    \ [8]. Therefore, this paper is\ndevoted to the research on the speciﬁc application\
    \ and\napproach of smart park system in the process of urban park\nrenovation\
    \ and renewal and to design smart garden system\nbased on wireless sensor technology\
    \ [9]. Introduce the smart\npark system into the development process of the renovation\n\
    and reconstruction of the park and build an urban smart\npark that provides residents\
    \ with a comfortable green space\nexperience and provides an intelligent operation\
    \ and man-\nagement model for the city park management department.\n2. Related\
    \ Works\nAt present, with the eﬀective development and continuous\nprogress of\
    \ social economy, modern science and technology\nhave made more achievements,\
    \ and the development of\nwireless sensor networks has become more mature. Because\n\
    the wireless sensor network itself has many advantages such\nas low cost and low\
    \ energy consumption, its application\nscope in the ﬁeld of environmental monitoring\
    \ is gradually\nexpanding, and good application results have been achieved.\n\
    Cheng and Wu proposed that through the investigation and\nanalysis of the actual\
    \ application of wireless sensor networks\nin environmental monitoring, it is\
    \ found that the hardware\nresources of wireless sensor networks are limited,\
    \ and the\nwireless sensor nodes will be aﬀected by the energy con-\nsumption\
    \ of the body and the storage space in the process\nof environmental monitoring\
    \ [10]. The power consumption\nof related equipment is relatively large. If the\
    \ wireless sensor\nresources are limited and the battery cannot be replaced in\n\
    time, the overall eﬀect of environmental monitoring will be\naﬀected. Harfouche\
    \ et al. pointed out that the improvement\nof network monitoring data reliability\
    \ provides a guarantee.\nIn such systems, the construction of the system generally\n\
    includes sensor nodes, routers, gateways, and supervision\ncenters [11]. Among\
    \ them, the sensor nodes include data\nmonitoring nodes and aggregation nodes,\
    \ which are mainly\nresponsible for the data collection and transmission. The\n\
    router is responsible for the communication gateway\nbetween the supervision center\
    \ and the information collec-\ntion point based on a speciﬁc routing protocol\
    \ and is respon-\nsible for transmitting the received data to the supervision\n\
    center. The data storage center and the remote control cen-\nter are responsible\
    \ for storing monitoring data and sending\ncontrol commands, respectively. Overall,\
    \ the wireless sensor\nnetwork is a dynamic network system. The sensor nodes can\n\
    move freely. When the battery energy is used up or the node\nis disconnected from\
    \ the network due to the failure of the\nnode, it will also join the network due\
    \ to the needs of net-\nwork work. Bredikhin et al. pointed out that the network\n\
    can carry out eﬀective analysis and processing under certain\nlimited conditions\
    \ and clarify its speciﬁc request quantity,\nwhich is the energy eﬃciency of the\
    \ wireless sensor network.\nThe energy eﬃciency of wireless sensor networks is\
    \ also one\nof the most important and critical performance criteria in\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks [12].\nThe research on smart gardens is mainly divided into\n\
    two parts: theoretical research and applied research. In terms\nof theoretical\
    \ research, Bakshi and Charles proposed that the\ncurrent main digital design\
    \ methods are sorted out, and a\npreliminary and relatively accurate concept of\
    \ digital plan-\nning and design of landscape architecture is made [13]. In\n\
    the lineage delineation, the ﬁrst is the computer-aided design\nlineage, the second\
    \ is the digital design media and informa-\ntion management lineage, and the third\
    \ is the digital infor-\nmation model of landscape architecture. The computer-\n\
    aided design spectrum includes computer-aided design and\nanalysis, computer-generated\
    \ design, and parametric design.\nComputer-aided design is to carry out targeted\
    \ analysis of\nsite conditions and project requirements at the beginning\nof the\
    \ design according to the results of investigation and\ninspection and convert\
    \ this information into computer-\nidentiﬁable digital information for further\
    \ processing in\nother computer-aided design tools. Computer-aided evalua-\ntion\
    \ is to evaluate and judge the plan according to speciﬁc\nstandards after the\
    \ preliminary design plan is formed, ana-\nlyze the advantages and disadvantages,\
    \ and provide possible\ndirections for the modiﬁcation of the plan. Monteiro et\
    \ al.\npointed out that computer-generated design, using compu-\ntational geometry\
    \ and algorithm generation technology,\ngenerates dynamic and beautiful formal\
    \ structures, analyzes\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nthe dynamic evolution of landscape\
    \ architecture, analyzes\nthe spatial activities of creatures in the habitat,\
    \ including\nhuman beings, and is also used to predict the changing trend\nof\
    \ ecological environment metabolism [14]. It can also per-\nform architectural\
    \ and spatial scale layout, road generation,\nand sculpture creation. Parametric\
    \ design can temporarily\nbe understood as parametric modeling. A geometric model\n\
    controlled by speciﬁc parameters is established on a software\nplatform with parametric\
    \ functions. After the geometric\nmodel passes the design evaluation stage, the\
    \ evaluation\ninformation is fed back to the parameterization in the form\nof\
    \ parameters. The software platform is further optimized.\nIn the application\
    \ research section, A. Atilgan and C. Atilgan\npointed out that the application\
    \ content of landscape digital\ntechnology includes digital analysis, digital\
    \ aided design, dig-\nital modeling, digital media, and virtual visualization\
    \ tech-\nnology; for digital analysis, my country was originally\napplied in the\
    \ ﬁeld of geographic information, using GIS\ntechnology to digitally analyze and\
    \ simulate hydrology, ter-\nrain, climate, ecological suitability, and landscape\
    \ patterns\nand use network multisource data analysis to conduct\nresearch on\
    \ spatial heat, urban spatial distribution, and road\naccessibility [15]. For\
    \ the development of related software,\ndigital aided design is also gradually\
    \ applied to landscape\nplanning and design, using GIS, Sketchup, 3DMax, Photo-\n\
    shop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lumion, and other software for\npreanalysis, establishment\
    \ of 3D models, program text and\nrendering production, and virtual animation\
    \ video [16].\n3. Design of Smart Garden System Based on\nWireless Sensors Network\n\
    3.1. Selection of Wireless Sensors. The wireless sensor net-\nwork architecture\
    \ consists of wireless sensor network proto-\ncols, which are mainly responsible\
    \ for signal modulation and\neﬀective transmission and reception of signals, such\
    \ as infra-\nred and data link layer. The data link layer is responsible for\n\
    the detection of data framing and is responsible for expand-\ning the media for\
    \ strict access to the protocol; it can also\nachieve point-to-point and point-to-multipoint\
    \ communica-\ntion goals without socket control.\nWireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ is a form of network\nformed by freely organizing and combining tens of thousands\n\
    of sensor nodes through wireless communication technology.\nThe units constituting\
    \ the sensor node are the data acquisition\nunit, data transmission unit, data\
    \ processing unit, and energy\nsupply unit. It is a wireless network composed\
    \ of a large num-\nber of static or mobile sensors in a self-organizing and multi-\n\
    hop manner, which cooperatively senses, collects, processes,\nand transmits information\
    \ about sensed objects within a geo-\ngraphic area covered by the network and\
    \ ultimately sends this\ninformation to the network owner.\nWireless sensor networks\
    \ have many types of sensors\nthat can detect a variety of phenomena in the surrounding\n\
    environment,\nincluding\nearthquakes,\nelectromagnetism,\ntemperature, humidity,\
    \ noise, light intensity, pressure, soil\ncomposition, size, speed, and direction\
    \ of moving objects.\nThe soil moisture sensor is mainly used to measure the\n\
    moisture content in the soil, which plays an important role\nin understanding\
    \ soil moisture and realizing scientiﬁc and\nprecise irrigation. According to\
    \ the needs of the automatic\ncontrol system for precision irrigation of sunken\
    \ gardens\nof Beijing Forestry University for soil moisture measure-\nment, the\
    \ HYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor independently\ndeveloped by the Precision Water-Saving\
    \ Irrigation Control\nLaboratory of the School of Engineering, Beijing Forestry\n\
    University, was selected to monitor the sunken gardens. Soil\nmoisture content\
    \ provides important data parameters for\nprecise irrigation decision theory.\
    \ The principle of the\nHYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor is to use a signal source\n\
    with a frequency of 100 MHz to send out a wireless wave sig-\nnal, and the wireless\
    \ wave signal is transmitted to the probe\ncomposed of four stainless steel probes\
    \ through a coaxial\ntransmission line. When the impedance is diﬀerent, the volt-\n\
    age amplitudes of the incident wave and the reﬂected wave\nare diﬀerent when the\
    \ signal propagates on the transmission\nline. The superposition forms a standing\
    \ wave, and the volt-\nage at each point on the transmission line changes. The\
    \ ana-\nlog acquisition module can convert the value of soil moisture\ncontent\
    \ by collecting the voltage value of the sensor signal\nline, and its performance\
    \ indicators are shown in Table 1.\nThe sensor measures soil water content based\
    \ on the\nprinciple of standing wave rate. The product has the func-\ntions of\
    \ analog signal output (0~2.5 V) and RS232 digital sig-\nnal. It has the advantages\
    \ of convenient use, accurate\nmeasurement, and rapid response. It is widely used\
    \ in scien-\ntiﬁc experiments, water saving irrigation, greenhouses, and\nother\
    \ water content measurement.\nIn this project, the soil moisture sensor is buried\
    \ in the\narea where soil moisture content needs to be detected as\nshown in Figure\
    \ 1, and the soil moisture content is moni-\ntored in real time to provide important\
    \ data parameters for\nirrigation decision-making.\nInstallation diagram of soil\
    \ moisture sensor air tempera-\nture and humidity, carbon dioxide sensor monitoring\
    \ air\ntemperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content, and\nother microenvironmental\
    \ information can be displayed in\ndigital form to understand the current environmental\
    \ infor-\nmation more intuitively. It can provide data parameter guid-\nance for\
    \ future analysis of plant growth status by detecting\ncarbon dioxide content.\n\

    from Sweden, which has high precision in measuring carbon\ndioxide. In the case\
    \ of good environmental conditions, the\nmeasured value is generally 400 ppm.\n\
    3.2. Theoretical Research on Smart Gardens. “Smart gardens”\nare modern smart\
    \ landscape gardens with smart service sys-\ntems that meet the new requirements\
    \ of the new era. In\naddition, the concept of smart garden in a broad sense is\n\
    deﬁned as follows: based on “the Internet of Things” tech-\nnology, combined with\
    \ many advanced science and technol-\nogy such as big data, cloud computing, mobile\
    \ Internet, and\nspatial geographic information system (GIS), in the planning\n\
    and design of landscape gardens. In the construction, pro-\nduction, research,\
    \ and management of garden and landscape\nfacilities, many facilities and functions\
    \ within the garden are\nconnected with each other with high-tech hands, forming\
    \ an\nintelligent unity of information collection, sharing, and feed-\nback, while\
    \ fully respecting the wisdom of nature, to further\nsublimate humanistic wisdom.\
    \ In addition, it is necessary to\nuse\nadvanced\nscientiﬁc\nand technological\n\
    wisdom\nto\nenhance and improve various functions of garden landscape,\necology,\
    \ recreation, and so on from multiple angles, levels,\nand aspects, in order to\
    \ achieve eﬃcient garden intelligent\nservice and management.\nThe technical level\
    \ of the system architecture is divided\ninto ﬁve layers: perception layer, network\
    \ layer, data layer,\nplatform layer, and application layer, which is shown in\n\
    Figure 2. The perception layer is the foundation of the entire\narchitecture and\
    \ the main way to obtain and transmit data\nand information. Aerial survey, remote\
    \ sensing, GPS, satel-\nlite positioning, and digital map technologies are used\
    \ to col-\nlect various data in the park. The network layer is a bridge\nfor information\
    \ and data transmission, which can transmit\nvarious data information collected\
    \ and realize the eﬃciency\nof data transmission based on the “5G network” and\
    \ “Inter-\nnet of Things.” The data layer has a storage function. It can\nadd\
    \ and subtract, store, and analyze a large amount of data\nand at the same time\
    \ make intelligent decision-making and\nintuitively display real-time data and\
    \ decision-making\nprompts in the platform layer to achieve deep data sorting\n\

    \ layer. As the last step and the most important\nrealization link of smart garden\
    \ construction, the application\nlayer of the smart garden includes two aspects:\
    \ intelligent\nmanagement system application and intelligent service system\n\
    application. The intelligent management system is oriented to\npark managers,\
    \ making intelligent decisions or artiﬁcial deci-\nsions through the collected\
    \ real-time data and feedback to\nadjust the park intelligent management facilities\
    \ such as park\nintelligent sprinkler irrigation facilities; the intelligent service\n\
    system is oriented to park tourists, through big data analysis,\ninformation transmission\
    \ feedback, application of intelligent\nservice facilities, and other means to\
    \ provide tourists with a\nvariety of intelligent services.\n3.3. Research on\
    \ Smart Garden Facilities\n3.3.1. Smart Management System Facilities. The smart\
    \ man-\nagement system is a system in the smart park system for\npark managers\
    \ to manage the park intelligently through\nanalysis,\nprocessing,\nand\ntimely\n\
    feedback\nadjustment\nthrough the park intelligent management facilities, in order\n\
    to realize the intelligent management of the park as a whole.\nThe perception\
    \ layer, network layer, data layer, and platform\nlayer in the ﬁve systems of\
    \ the smart garden architecture\nserve for the intelligent practice of the management\
    \ system,\nand the application layer is the goal and realization form of\nthe\
    \ intelligent management system.\nThe\napplication\nof\nintelligent\nmanagement\n\
    system\nincludes environmental monitoring system (environmental\nquality monitoring,\
    \ water quality monitoring, and biodiversity\nmonitoring), intelligent irrigation\
    \ system (automatic sprinkler\nirrigation system and remote control system), intelligent\
    \ light-\ning (automatic induction and remote control and intelligent\ndetection\
    \ of equipment failure), intelligent maintenance\n(intelligent cleaning, protection\
    \ of pests and diseases, protec-\ntion of ancient and famous trees, ﬁre monitoring,\
    \ and equip-\nment management), intelligent security (people and traﬃc\nﬂow monitoring,\
    \ real-time security positioning and schedul-\ning, and emergency warning), intelligent\
    \ transportation (entry\npark population analysis and unmanned vehicle scheduling),\n\
    and smart energy consumption management (water and\npower consumption management\
    \ and rapid fault location).\nThe successful realization of feedback regulation\
    \ of intel-\nligent management system requires the support of intelligent\nmanagement\
    \ facilities. Intelligent management facilities are\nmainly divided into sensor\
    \ devices and intelligent feedback\nadjustment facilities. The intelligent management\
    \ facilities\nin the environmental monitoring system include data collec-\ntion\
    \ devices such as integrated sensors and water quality\nsensors for collecting\
    \ information such as park air and water\nquality. Cooling sprays, smart water\
    \ pumps, etc. are used for\nfeedback regulation facility for park cooling or water\
    \ quality\ncleanup. The intelligent management facilities in the intelli-\ngent\
    \ irrigation system include soil sensors for detecting soil\nconditions in the\
    \ park and intelligent sprinkler irrigation\ndevices for sprinkler irrigation.\
    \ The intelligent management\nfacilities in intelligent lighting are intelligent\
    \ street lamps,\nwhich integrate infrared sensing and intelligent light adjust-\n\
    ment. The intelligent management facilities in intelligent\nmaintenance include\
    \ wireless multimedia sensor network sys-\ntem for monitoring plant diseases and\
    \ insect pests; DHT22,\nAM2302, and HP206C sensors for monitoring the growth sta-\n\
    tus of ancient and famous trees; and ﬁre detection sensors for\nmonitoring ﬁre.\
    \ Intelligent management facilities in smart\nsecurity include smart face recognition\
    \ cameras, which can\nmonitor tourists and road safety in the park in real time.\n\
    The two applications of intelligent transportation and intelli-\ngent energy consumption\
    \ management mainly use the combi-\nnation of intelligent camera monitoring and\
    \ manual rapid\nresponse to realize the intelligent management of parks.\nMost\
    \ of the existing routing protocols use clustering to\noptimize the network, and\
    \ some network protocols preset\nthe number of cluster heads. This algorithm cannot\
    \ achieve\nnetwork energy balance. When the number of cluster heads\nis set too\
    \ small, the distance between the member nodes in\nthe cluster and the cluster\
    \ head node will be too far, causing\nthe member nodes to consume too much energy\
    \ in data\ntransmission, and even some member nodes exceed the reli-\nable communication\
    \ range. Monitoring data loss when the\nnumber of cluster heads is too large will\
    \ also cause excess\nenergy consumption, because the cluster head node under-\n\
    takes the tasks of data reception, forwarding, and fusion pro-\ncessing of the\
    \ member nodes in the cluster. The relationship\nbetween the number of groups\
    \ and network energy con-\nsumption is shown as follows:\nd2\ntoCH =\nð ð\nÀa2\

    \ System Facilities. On the other hand, the\nmain application of a smart garden\
    \ is to build a complete\nsmart service system. The smart service system is mainly\
    \ ori-\nented to tourists and applied to the needs of tourists in the\nprocess\
    \ of visiting the park. The application research of\nsmart service system in urban\
    \ park is the research content\nof this paper, and this part of the content will\
    \ be studied in\ndepth in the next paper.\nThe smart service system also has ﬁve\
    \ layers: the percep-\ntion layer, the network layer, the data layer, the platform\n\
    layer, and the application layer. However, compared with\nthe smart management\
    \ system, some smart service facilities\nin the smart service system can basically\
    \ achieve autono-\nmous feedback without going through the park’s AI brain\nand\
    \ performing data processing. Smart service facilities are\nmore often used to\
    \ collect tourist information such as ﬁtness\ninformation or intention to visit\
    \ the park. For example, the\n5\nJournal of Sensors\nsmart ﬁtness system senses\
    \ and collects various real-time\ndata of tourists in the park by establishing\
    \ a perception layer\nwith sensors as the main tool, including exercise kilometers.\n\
    Count, calorie consumption value, body temperature, body\nfat, and other indicators\
    \ display the corresponding data\nfeedback on the platform layer such as the smart\
    \ display\nscreen or the tourist mobile APP terminal. The intelligent\nservice\
    \ system is a set of more intelligent and modernized,\nmore user-friendly and\
    \ convenient, and more precise intelli-\ngent service system in line with the\
    \ concept of people-ori-\nented, built under the concept of smart garden.\nThe\
    \ smart service facilities in the smart service system\ngenerally include multimedia\
    \ touch screen interactive sys-\ntem, mobile APP guide, smart trail, smart AR\
    \ ﬁtness, ﬁtness\npoint system, rain garden interactive display device, interac-\n\
    tive bicycle device, natural soundscape experience device,\nhistorical and cultural\
    \ science, animal and plant science,\nsmart seats, smart conference rooms, and\
    \ smart unmanned\nvehicles.\n3.4. Digital Landscape Garden Design\n3.4.1. Related\
    \ Technical Support. Mobile Internet technology\ncan provide cloud-based services\
    \ and real-time resources\nand have the advantages of sharing and open functions.\n\
    Mobile Internet technology is an important technical sup-\nport foundation for\
    \ the smart upgrade and transformation\nof urban parks. Through its network construction\
    \ in urban\nparks, real-time sharing of various information within the\nparks\
    \ can be achieved to meet the management and use\nneeds of urban parks.\nThe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) refers to the real-time\nacquisition of any object or process\
    \ that needs to be moni-\ntored, connected, and interacted with through various\n\
    devices and technologies, such as various information sen-\nsors, radio frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation technology, global posi-\ntioning systems, and infrared sensors,\
    \ and through various\npossible network access to collect all kinds of information\n\
    required, to achieve intelligent perception, recognition, and\nmanagement of objects\
    \ and processes. The Internet of\nThings is an information carrier based on the\
    \ Internet, tradi-\ntional telecommunication networks, etc. It enables all com-\n\
    mon physical objects to be addressed independently to\nform an interconnected\
    \ network [2]. Wireless sensor net-\nworks (WSNs) are distributed sensor networks\
    \ that detect\nthe outside world through sensors placed at terminals and\nacquire\
    \ and transmit the required data. The multihop ad\nhoc network composed of wireless\
    \ sensors in a wireless sen-\nsor network is an important technical form of the\
    \ underlying\nnetwork of the Internet of Things. A typical sensor network\nstructure\
    \ includes distributed sensor points (clusters), sink\nnodes, Internet, and user\
    \ interfaces.\nCloud computing is to decompose massive data comput-\ning processing\
    \ programs into countless small applications\nthrough the Internet, process and\
    \ analyze these small appli-\ncations through a system application composed of\
    \ multiple\ninformation processors and servers, and ﬁnally get the result\nand\
    \ return it to the user. Through the application of cloud\ncomputing technology\
    \ in the smart park system, the collec-\ntion and processing of various complex\
    \ information data\nin the park can be completed in a very short period of time,\n\
    providing powerful information technology services for the\npark. Cloud computing\
    \ is a type of distributed computing,\nwhich refers to decomposing huge data computing\
    \ process-\ning programs into countless small programs through the\nnetwork “cloud”\
    \ and then processing and analyzing these\nsmall programs through a system composed\
    \ of multiple\nservers to obtain results and return them to users. In the\nearly\
    \ days of cloud computing, it was simply distributed\ncomputing, which solved\
    \ task distribution and merged com-\nputing results. Therefore, cloud computing\
    \ is also known as\ngrid computing. Through this technology, it is possible to\n\
    complete the processing of tens of thousands of data in a\nvery short time (a\
    \ few seconds), thereby achieving powerful\nnetwork services.\nFor the division\
    \ of various areas involved in the applica-\ntion of wireless sensors in smart\
    \ gardens, the fuzzy clustering\nalgorithm is used. In fuzzy clustering, the sample\
    \ set X is\ndivided into k fuzzy subsets \x01X1, \x01X2, ⋯, \x01Xk, Sk\ni=1 supp\
    \ ð\x01XkÞ\n= X, where supp represents support sets of fuzzy sets. The\nmembership\
    \ function uil of the sample extends from {0, 1}\nbinary to [0, 1] interval, and\
    \ uil ∈ Mf .\nMf = uiljuil ∈ 0, 1\n½\n\x02\nf\n,\n〠\nk\ni=1\nuil = 1,∀l,\n0 <\
    \ 〠\nn\nl=1\nuil < n,∀i:\nð5Þ\nFor a given set of samples, fuzzy clustering analysis\
    \ can\neasily obtain a fuzzy k-partition U = fuilj1 ≤ i ≤ k ; 1 ≤ l ≤ ng.\n3.4.2.\
    \ Basic Architecture. Garden planning ﬁrst needs to\nbuild a perfect smart garden\
    \ system. By establishing a per-\nception layer, BIM information model, 3S (GPS,\
    \ RS, GIS)\nmonitoring system, sensors, etc., it can sense and collect\nthe moisture\
    \ and soil conditions and temperature of the\ngarden; the real-time dynamics of\
    \ information such as envi-\nronment, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration,\n\
    using the Internet of Things; and a 5G network to build a\nnetwork layer to transmit\
    \ real-time information and then\nbuild a data layer through big data intelligent\
    \ analysis to\ncomprehensively process and analyze data and make corre-\nsponding\
    \ intelligent decisions. Create a “one picture” intel-\nligent platform layer\
    \ for intuitive data display and ﬁnally\nbuild a professional application layer\
    \ to implement the cor-\nresponding intelligent decision-making and set up environ-\n\
    mental perception, energy consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent\
    \ security, maintenance manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting. Manage\
    \ seven\nfunctional modules and corresponding smart park facilities,\nwhich are\
    \ shown in Figure 3.\nBy establishing a water quality, soil moisture, air quality,\n\
    illuminance monitoring, and control management system,\nthe\nsmart\ngarden\nsystem\n\

    \ analysis of parks and tourists;\nrealizes\nremote\nmonitoring,\nprediction,\n\
    control,\nand\nresponse on the PC or mobile phone, disposal, and other\nintelligent\
    \ management; and fundamentally upgrade and\ntransform the technology, reﬁnement,\
    \ and conservation of\nthe daily management of the park. The establishment of\n\
    the garden intelligent system can provide garden managers\nwith an eﬃcient and\
    \ convenient management platform, save\nmanagement resources, and reduce operation\
    \ and mainte-\nnance costs. The system process is shown in Figure 4.\n3.4.3. Model\
    \ Construction. Collect the data information of\nthe research object, select the\
    \ required information, and ana-\nlyze and use it through integrated processing\
    \ and analysis\nresearch. Through the dynamic detection of advanced\nremote sensing\
    \ technology, various kinds of accurate infor-\nmation of garden green space can\
    \ be obtained regularly, so\nthe dynamic monitoring of gardens increasingly relies\
    \ on\nRS remote sensing technology. GIS (geographic information\nsystem) is an\
    \ interdisciplinary subject closely related to mul-\ntiple disciplines. GIS is\
    \ closely related to earth science, infor-\nmation science, and even space science\
    \ and other disciplines.\nGIS is based on geospatial data and uses the support\
    \ of com-\nputer software and hardware technology to collect, store,\nprocess,\
    \ manage, and analyze the required data in space. It\ntakes building a geographic\
    \ model as an analysis method\nand can eﬃciently and conveniently provide the\
    \ required\nspatially related dynamic geographic information data. The\nsmart\
    \ garden GIS monitoring system can complete the cen-\ntralized display of dynamic\
    \ data such as environmental\nmonitoring, garden animal and plant monitoring,\
    \ and gar-\nden park service facilities, hold important events or emer-\ngency\
    \ command, and dispatch assignments in emergencies.\nGPS satellite positioning,\
    \ RS remote sensing and GIS\ngeographic information system (3S) synergy, combined\
    \ with\nsensors to build a smart garden dynamic data receiving net-\nwork, are\
    \ the eyes of the smart garden system, and it is also\nnecessary to build a smart\
    \ garden system, which is an indis-\npensable part.\nIn addition to using the\
    \ 3S monitoring system, the con-\nstruction of the intelligent sensor system also\
    \ needs to build\na complete sensor network in the park, which is diﬀerent\nfrom\
    \ the 3S method of obtaining information in stages. A\nlarge number of smart sensors\
    \ can cooperate to build a com-\nplete smart sensor network.\nThe intelligent\
    \ sensor system mostly uses solar energy as\nthe working energy to create a fully\
    \ automatic working envi-\nronment. At the same time, it can be divided into integrated\n\
    sensors and water quality sensors according to diﬀerent\napplication environments.\
    \ The functions of smart sensors\nunder the smart management system include collecting\n\
    and recording real-time information of more than a dozen\npark environments such\
    \ as soil temperature and humidity,\nnegative oxygen ions, air temperature and\
    \ humidity,\nPM2.5, ultraviolet intensity, light, carbon dioxide concentra-\n\
    tion, air pressure, and noise. The network layer transmits\ndata to the AI intelligent\
    \ brain, and the real-time monitoring\ndata is analyzed and processed in an appropriate\
    \ manner\nand presented to the corresponding modules of the manage-\nment platform,\
    \ providing convenience for park managers\nand improving management eﬃciency.\n\
    In the intelligent management platform, the construc-\ntion of an intelligent\
    \ integrated management platform is\nequivalent to the brain of the park. Various\
    \ real-time infor-\nmation collected by the GIS monitoring system and intelli-\n\
    gent sensors is transmitted to the AI brain central control\nroom through the\
    \ “5G network and Internet of Things” sys-\ntem. After processing, it is displayed\
    \ on the digital twin visu-\nalization\nplatform,\nthat\nis,\nthe\nOne\nMap\n\
    intelligent\nmanagement platform, where the data is stored and visual-\nized.\
    \ Managers can dynamically monitor various data in\nthe park through the visual\
    \ management platform of the sys-\ntem, so as to carry out remote management of\
    \ intelligent\nfacilities in the park green space. The intelligent manage-\nment\
    \ platform includes seven functional modules: environ-\nmental perception, energy\
    \ consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent security, maintenance\
    \ manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting management. Each\nfunctional\
    \ module has corresponding perception, network,\ndata, platform, and application\
    \ ﬁve levels. For each manage-\nment function, the corresponding automatic decision-\n\
    making and intelligent application can be adjusted, so that\nit can fully realize\

    8\nJournal of Sensors\nBy rationally arranging smart streetlights, the park can\
    \ be\nrealized. The global coverage of the internal network, the\nsmooth information\
    \ transmission, and the real-time moni-\ntoring of various information in the\
    \ park smart streetlights\ncannot only meet the lighting needs of parks but also\
    \ pro-\nvide a comfortable nighttime recreation environment for\nurban residents.\
    \ It can also be superimposed by multipole-\nin-one technical modules, that is,\
    \ the combination of wire-\nless network, surveillance camera, environmental detection\n\
    sensor, wireless broadcasting, mobile phone charging inter-\nface, emergency call\
    \ ( as shown in Figure 5), and other mod-\nules, on the basis of satisfying the\
    \ lighting function, to build\na smart network of parks. At the same time, the\
    \ design of\nsmart street lamps should be combined with the park cul-\nture. Smart\
    \ streetlights can intelligently adjust the light dis-\ntribution intensity by\
    \ automatically sensing the brightness\nof the outside world and using the electronic\
    \ display screen\non the streetlights to release park information. Respond\npromptly\
    \ to situations that occur in the park.\n4.2. Security and Rescue. The smart security\
    \ monitoring and\ncontrol system monitor various areas in the park in real time\n\
    through surveillance cameras arranged on smart streetlights,\nsmart trash cans,\
    \ and other park infrastructure (as shown in\nFigure 6). The security monitoring\
    \ system can also add a\nface recognition module, which can be integrated into\
    \ the\nsecurity system of the smart city through the public security\nnetwork\
    \ to ensure the public safety of urban residents in the\npark. When a dangerous\
    \ situation occurs in the park, the\nintelligent monitoring system will issue\
    \ an alarm to the park\nmanagement personnel in time and broadcast it to the city\n\
    residents in real time through the broadcasting system in\nthe park, so that the\
    \ park management personnel can take\ncorresponding measures in time for the abnormal\
    \ situation\nand ensure the safe operation of the park.\nEmergency rescue system\
    \ includes an emergency rescue\nalarm system and automatic emergency rescue positioning\n\
    system. A positioning system is an interrelated assembly or\ndevice (component)\
    \ formed with the goal of determining a\nspatial location. This system can ensure\
    \ that at least four sat-\nellites can be observed simultaneously at any point\
    \ on the\nEarth at any time, to ensure that the satellites can collect\nthe longitude,\
    \ latitude, and height of the observation point,\nin order to achieve navigation,\
    \ positioning, timing, and\nother functions. This technology can be used to guide\
    \ air-\ncraft, ships, vehicles, and individuals to safely and accurately\nfollow\
    \ selected routes and arrive at their destinations on\ntime. Its basic principle\
    \ is to measure the distance between\na satellite with a known location and the\
    \ user’s receiver\nand then integrate the data from multiple satellites to know\n\
    the speciﬁc location of the receiver. To achieve this goal, the\nposition of the\
    \ satellite can be found in the satellite ephem-\neris based on the time recorded\
    \ by the onboard clock.\nThrough the self-service alarm columns arranged in the\n\
    parks, it is convenient for urban residents to send rescue sig-\nnals to the park\
    \ managers in case of emergencies (as shown\nin Figure 7). After receiving the\
    \ rescue signal from the park\nvisitors, the park management department cannot\
    \ only\ncommunicate with the seeker remotely through the emer-\ngency rescue alarm\
    \ system but also quickly grasp the loca-\ntion of the seeker through the automatic\
    \ emergency rescue\npositioning system and dispatch the park management per-\n\
    sonnel to the scene for disposal in time. The emergency res-\ncue system eﬀectively\
    \ protects the property and personal\nsafety of urban residents, safeguards the\
    \ legitimate personal\ninterests of traveling residents, and facilitates the safety\
    \ and\nsecurity of park managers.\n4.3. Plant Maintenance. The vegetation construction\
    \ of\nurban parks provides an excellent resting environment for\nurban residents,\

    \ and is also an important part\nof urban parks. Plant conservation in urban parks\
    \ is also\none of the important tasks of the park management depart-\nment, which\
    \ requires a lot of human and material resources\nto ensure the green environment\
    \ of the park. Integrating the\napplication of the smart park system in the renovation\
    \ and\nrenewal of urban parks can better play the function of pub-\nlicity, education,\
    \ and popularization of parks and deepen the\ninteractive experience between urban\
    \ residents and parks. At\nthe same time, the smart plant maintenance system can\
    \ bet-\nter assist urban park managers to carry out convenient and\naccurate plant\
    \ maintenance work, saving manpower and\nmaterial resources.\nThe plant maintenance\
    \ work in urban parks is relatively\nheavy. Through the construction of an intelligent\
    \ plant\nmaintenance system, real-time monitoring and automatic\nmanagement of\
    \ vegetation and soil in the park can be real-\nized, which greatly improves the\
    \ work eﬃciency of urban\npark management departments. The intelligent plant main-\n\
    tenance system uses wireless sensors arranged in the soil\n(as shown in Figure\
    \ 8) to monitor the relevant data of soil\nmoisture and nutrients in real time\
    \ and collect and analyze\nthe data to intelligently generate maintenance management\n\
    work requirements. At the same time, the intelligent plant\nmaintenance management\
    \ system is also combined with\nthe intelligent rainwater collection and management\
    \ system\nto automate nozzle and fertilization based on the real-time\nmonitoring\
    \ of soil data. The intelligent plant maintenance\nsystem also monitors the growth\
    \ status of plants in real time\nthrough the disease and insect pest monitoring\
    \ system.\nWhen a plant has a disease focus, it will automatically alarm\nin time\
    \ to remind the management staﬀ to take relevant\nmeasures.\n4.4. Cleaning System.\
    \ Most urban parks use purchased ﬁn-\nished trash cans, and the required number\
    \ of trash cans is\nreasonably calculated according to the park area and service\n\
    radius and arranged in the city park. Park managers need to\nregularly clean the\
    \ trash cans in the park every day to ensure\nthe sanitary environment in the\
    \ park, so they need to invest\na lot of human and material resources. When urban\
    \ parks\nare renovated and updated, the application of smart trash\ncans in the\
    \ park sanitation system can eﬀectively improve\nthe work eﬃciency of park management\
    \ workers and save\nresources. Smart trash cans are new trash cans equipped\n\
    with solar power panels, smart waste sorting systems, smart\ncompression systems,\
    \ and smart monitoring systems (as\nshown in Figure 9). Smart trash cans can automatically\
    \ clas-\nsify and compress all kinds of garbage and remind manage-\nment staﬀ\
    \ to deal with them in time when the capacity\nreaches the warning value. Smart\
    \ trash cans can also be\nequipped with wireless Wi-Fi modules, electronic display\n\
    modules, etc., to provide more diversiﬁed services for urban\nresidents and park\
    \ management departments.\nWhen urban parks are renovated, the upgrading of pub-\n\
    lic toilets is one of the essential contents to provide better\nservices for urban\
    \ residents. Smart public toilet technology\nis to use wireless sensor technology,\
    \ automatic air treatment\ntechnology, and other science and technology to realize\
    \ the\nautomatic service management of public toilets (as shown\nin Figure 10).\
    \ Through the real-time monitoring of various\nwireless sensors, smart public\
    \ toilets can realize the func-\ntions of public toilet vacancy display, intelligent\
    \ air circula-\ntion treatment, intelligent adjustment of light, automatic\ncleaning\
    \ and disinfection, intelligent water saving, and emer-\ngency alarm, thus providing\
    \ a convenient and low-carbon\nsmart city park public toilet.\nSmart plant care\

    \ arranged at park\nentrances and exits, important landscape nodes, and park\n\
    road intersections. The park information provided by them\nis relatively simple\
    \ and lacks interaction with urban resi-\ndents. An electronic map is a digital\
    \ display of information,\nusing electronic interactive displays or smartphone\
    \ apps to\npresent information about the park. The updated electronic\nmap during\
    \ the renovation of the urban park cannot only\ndisplay the introduction of the\
    \ park, the instructions for\ntourists, and the park map (as shown in Figure 11)\
    \ but also\nallow urban residents to have a good interaction with the\npark, so\
    \ that they can know their location in real time and\nevery detail during the\
    \ park tour. The detailed information\nof each landscape node can better plan\

    society and the economy, the number of vehicles per capita\nin cities is also\
    \ increasing rapidly, and the public parking lots\nin many urban parks can no\
    \ longer meet the needs of citi-\nzens. At the same time, due to the increase\
    \ in the number\nof vehicles, the workload of the park management depart-\nment\
    \ has also increased, and the travel experience of urban\nresidents has also been\
    \ aﬀected. In the process of renovation\nand renewal of urban parks, it is necessary\
    \ to renew the\nparking lots of existing urban parks according to the current\n\
    conditions such as park area, service radius, and traﬃc con-\nditions around the\
    \ park. At the same time, the introduction\nof a smart parking system can make\
    \ the parking process\nmore eﬃcient. The functions of the smart parking system\n\
    mainly include real-time monitoring of vehicle information,\nvehicle parking guidance,\
    \ data collection and storage analy-\nsis, and command control (as shown in Figure\
    \ 12). The\nsmart parking system implements traﬃc management by\ncollecting real-time\
    \ vehicle information and parking space\ninformation through the cooperation of\
    \ wireless sensing\ntechnology and cloud computing. Through the command\ncontrol\
    \ after data collection and processing, the information\ndisplay in the smart\
    \ parking lot can display the number of\nremaining parking spaces in real time\
    \ and guide the driver\nto ﬁnd the parking location conveniently and eﬃciently\n\
    through the indicator lights in the parking lot, saving park-\ning time. The intelligent\
    \ monitoring and feedback system\nof the smart parking lot also greatly facilitates\
    \ the manage-\nment of the parking lot by the park managers and can better\nserve\
    \ the urban residents.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper explores the process of urban\
    \ park renovation\nand renewal through the combination of relevant theoretical\n\
    basis for urban park renovation and on-site investigation. At\nthe same time,\
    \ based on the relevant research and investiga-\ntion of the smart park system,\
    \ the application of the smart\npark system in the renovation and renewal of urban\
    \ parks\nwas explored. At present, the relevant research and applica-\ntion of\
    \ smart city are relatively mature. As the construction\nof urban parks cannot\
    \ be ignored in urban construction, it\nis necessary to study and refer to relevant\
    \ applications of\nsmart cities to better integrate them into the application\
    \ of\nparks. The smart park system is a comprehensive system\nthat combines multiple\
    \ disciplines. How to combine science\nand technology more systematically and\
    \ comprehensively to\nestablish a smart link between urban residents and parks\
    \ and\nbetter serve the daily life of residents requires more in-depth\ndiscussion\
    \ and discussion in the future research. This paper\nlacks depth and breadth in\
    \ the discussion and research on\nrelated applications of the smart park system\

    Guadalupe 30107, (Murcia) Spain SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary Agriculture is
    one of the key sectors where technology is opening new opportunities to break
    up the market. The Internet of Things (IoT) could reduce the production costs
    and increase the product quality by providing intelligence services via IoT analytics.
    However, the hard weather conditions and the lack of connectivity in this field
    limit the successful deployment of such services as they require both, ie, fully
    connected infrastructures and highly computational resources. Edge computing has
    emerged as a solution to bring computing power in close proximity to the sensors,
    providing energy savings, highly responsive web services, and the ability to mask
    transient cloud outages. In this paper, we propose an IoT monitoring system to
    activate anti-frost techniques to avoid crop loss, by defining two intelligent
    services to detect outliers caused by the sensor errors. The former is a nearest
    neighbor technique and the latter is the k-means algorithm, which provides better
    quality results but it increases the computational cost. Cloud versus edge computing
    approaches are analyzed by targeting two different low-power GPUs. Our experimental
    results show that cloud-based approaches provides highest performance in general
    but edge computing is a compelling alternative to mask transient cloud outages
    and provide highly responsive data analytic services in technologically hostile
    environments. 1 INTRODUCTION Mainly motivated by the high competition of the market,
    the high demands on the quality of products, and the lack of scarce resources
    such as water,1 agriculture is constantly evolving toward the adoption of new
    technologies. Increasingly, more farmers are applying new technologies to obtain
    products with higher quality and less cost. A new research area has emerged as
    a result of these concepts called Precision Agriculture (PA).2 Precision agriculture
    is an innovative, integrated, and internationally standardized approach to increase
    the efficiency of resource use and to reduce the uncertainty of decisions required
    to manage variability on farms.3 One of the greatest dangers in agriculture is
    arising from inclement weather. Floods or constant temperature changes are only
    some examples that may jeopardize the harvest, having dramatic consequences.4
    Particularly damaging is the case of the Region of Murcia (Southeastern Spain),
    where crops suffer temperature variations of up to 20 degrees Celsius (°C) on
    the same day. For example, temperatures at midday could reach values equal to
    or even higher than 20°C in winter, and the temperature at night could even become
    negative. These temperature variations make the flowering of trees predictable,
    particularly in stone fruit trees. When the tree is fully bloomed, the negative
    temperatures may cause the flower to freeze, which could be translated in losing
    the harvest, and thus, having significant economic loses. Some techniques are
    available to protect crops from low temperatures such as protective covers, artificial
    fog, fans, application of chemical treatments, or sprinkler irrigation.5, 6 The
    anti-freeze techniques are often too expensive and must be applied several hours
    in advance to really prevent frost in the crop. The main problem for farmers is
    the lack of frost prediction, as these techniques take several hours to protect
    the crop.7 Therefore, this challenging scenario requires several ingredients,
    ie, (1) real-time weather information for the crop in question; (2) analytical
    models that, from the information gathered, are capable of predicting a frost;
    and (3) enough time to be able to take appropriate action. Indeed, farmers can
    take advantage of technological innovations in the areas of computer science,
    telecommunications, and agriculture to answer these factors. One of the leading
    drivers of the digital revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices
    and humans are fully connected to the global network. The IoT is being widely
    applied in agriculture, as they are evolving towards continuous monitoring and
    automatized systems.8 The IoT revolution is underpinned by two key factors, ie,
    (1) data, which carries hidden patterns, correlations, and other valuable insights;
    and (2) real-time data analytics, since knowledge is often time-sensitive, and
    useful only within a specific time-frame.9 In this paper, we propose an Internet
    of Things (IoT) infrastructure to prevent frost to avoid the loss of the harvest.
    This infrastructure is composed of several modules, in which the main contributions
    of this paper are developed. These contributions are listed as follows. A data
    acquisition module is developed based on LoRa to provide good ratios of coverage,
    end-node''s power consumption, and scalability.10 An IoT intelligent module to
    make predictions about when the actuator should be switched on, is included in
    the infrastructure. This module is composed of several algorithms to identify
    outliers based on the nearest neighbor technique and the k-means clustering algorithm.
    The early detection of outliers is an important issue, since they can cause an
    incorrect operation of the actuators. For instance, sprinklers could be activated
    resulting in a loss of water and money or not activated, or activated too late,
    resulting in a loss of the crop. The time and high availability requirements found
    in this problem demand a high-performance architecture for these algorithms to
    be valid for frost prediction. Therefore, we propose a performance evaluation
    on low-power GPU-based computing architectures at the edge compared to their cloud-based
    counterpart versions. The IoT system proposed is able to activate the anti-frost
    technique of sprinkler irrigation due to its effectiveness and low installation
    cost compared to other techniques. The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 contextualizes this research and identifies the main novelties of this
    work with respect to previous works. Section 3 describes the components of the
    proposed IoT intelligent monitoring system and its practical implementation. Section
    9 provides evaluation results that demonstrate the accurate operation of our platform.
    Finally, Section 14 provides some conclusions and directions for future work.
    2 RELATED WORK The capacities that IoT offers can be applied in agricultural and
    farming applications. In the work of Ojha et al,11 some applications that use
    sensors and IoT technologies were applied to agriculture. Some of these applications
    are irrigation management system to optimize the water use in farming; control
    pest, disease, and fertilizers to increase the crop quality; farming systems monitoring
    to improve management in large agricultural fields; cattle movement monitoring
    using radio frequency identifier; remote control and diagnosis of farming machinery;
    and monitoring the ground water quality and the greenhouse gases, just to name
    a few. In the work of Srbinovska et al,12 a monitoring system to control the quality
    of peppers in greenhouse was presented. The topology shown is composed of a wireless
    sensor network (WSN) to control crops in greenhouses. The main drawback of this
    work is that their solution is not extrapolated to other environments. Ferentinos
    et al13 also presented a study where they assess wireless sensor networks operation,
    reliability, and accuracy in greenhouses. The authors perform an analysis of the
    collected data to research possible problematic situations for the growing plants
    caused by climatic heterogeneity inside the greenhouse. In the work of Lichtenberg
    et al,14 a WSN was proposed to monitor water level in the farm areas for precision
    agriculture. In the work of Gutiérrez et al,15 a similar network was implemented,
    but in this case, it is used to control the waste of water. It is noteworthy to
    highlight that in 136 days, they obtained a 90% reduction of water consumption
    compared with traditional irrigation systems. In the work of Lorite et al,16 the
    development and use of a wireless radio frequency technology for the performance
    analysis of an irrigation scheme was presented. The authors study the use of water
    with different crops by using telemetry, concluding farmers behavior management
    is extraordinarily complex due to the multiple factor implicated in the process.
    In the work of Martínez et al,17 the authors evaluated whether FIWARE platform
    is suitable for the development of agricultural applications. They propose an
    IoT scenario in the field of precision agriculture/viticulture for managing a
    large number of resources associated with sensors and actuators. The sensors detect
    data related to the environment and the condition of the vineyards (eg, water
    and nutrients). The actuators are installed in crop irrigation systems. Another
    work where the authors propose an improvement for irrigation in agriculture was
    presented in the work of Cambra et al.18 These authors implement an intelligent
    system for the control of bicarbonates in irrigation for precision hydroponic
    crops in order to improve water quality in hydroponic agriculture. They use different
    wireless sensors, including a pH sensor to measure nutrients. In the work of Gil-Lebrero
    et al,19 the authors presented a wireless monitoring system for honey bee hives.
    The IoT system architecture enables the easy deployment and scalability in the
    field. They used commercial nodes adapted to the measurements of the hives. The
    nodes allow the use of different technologies according to the scope range, including
    the following: 3G, GPRS, LoRa, Sigfox, ZigBee, or Wi-Fi. The LoRa technology has
    been used in agriculture20 to propose an embedded system called MoniSen that is
    capable of monitoring environmental parameters within a 10 km radius. The proposed
    hardware architecture is designed for continuous monitoring of five environmental
    parameters, ie, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and light intensity. Cambra et al21 presented an intelligent IoT communication
    system manager as a low-cost irrigation controller. The proposal is a irrigation
    tool that periodically samples real-time data such as the variable irrigation
    rate, the vegetation index, and irrigation events (flow rate, pressure level,
    or wind speed. However, to the best of our knowledge, we have not found any work
    that applies an IoT infrastructure to the field of frost prevention or cares about
    the quality of the data collected on the sensors and their validity. In addition
    to being in a new field of application, the IoT proposal made in this study applies
    techniques to correct and evaluate the quality of sensor data to detect outliers.
    Outlier detection is an important are within data mining and, particularly relevant
    in precision agriculture.22 In WSN, outliers are defined as “measures that deviate
    significantly from the normal pattern of detected sensed data.”23 This definition
    is based on the fact that sensor nodes are assigned in WSN to monitor the physical
    world and, therefore, there may be a pattern that represents the normal behavior
    of the detected data. It is important to consider that outlier detection is a
    task to be highlighted within the data processing. There are many outlier detections
    techniques in the literature as applied to WSN. In the work of Zhang et al,24
    a review of these techniques was carried out, showing a categorization of them
    into statistical-based approaches, nearest neighbor-based approaches, classification-based
    approaches, clustering-based approaches, and spectral decomposition-based approaches.
    In addition, Ayadi et al22 added to this classification of outliers detection
    techniques, the artificial intelligence techniques with fuzzy logic, such as artificial
    neural networks. Both classifications of the outlier techniques agree that KNN
    and clustering techniques are basic and effective techniques and they are also
    interpretable so they become appropriate techniques to be used by farmers. In
    the literature, there are different types of algorithms designed to detect outlier
    using the KNN algorithm and designing different distance measurements; we refer
    the reader to other works25-32 for insights. Some similarity happens with clustering
    algorithms for outlier detection; some examples include other works.33-37 3 THE
    IoT INFRASTRUCTURE TO AVOID THE FROST DAMAGE This section introduces the main
    components of the proposed IoT solution to minimize frost damage. Figure 1 shows
    the conceptual architecture of the proposed IoT monitoring system to reduce the
    frost crops. The system consists of three main components, ie, (1) climate sensors
    and anti-frost actuators, (2) an intelligent data processing system, and (3) a
    monitoring component. The intelligent component is halfway between the cloud and
    the actuator, and in this paper, we analyze where it is most feasible, effective,
    and reliable for that component to work. These three components are fully connected
    through a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to create an out-of-the-box IoT precision
    agriculture tool for minimizing damages caused by frost. In summary, the system
    monitors the climate data of an agricultural plot and, depending on the data,
    the system acts by activating the anti-frost system and alerting the farmer to
    make the appropriate decisions if this would be necessary. In what follows, we
    explain the main modules of the IoT infrastructure. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint The IoT system architecture 3.1 Wireless sensor network (WSN) One of
    the most important decisions relies on the selected wireless communication technology.
    Currently, there exists a myriad of IoT communication protocols that can be used
    for the interconnection of IoT nodes.8 There are many technologies available in
    the market but we have focused on those that achieve long transmission distances,
    low power consumption, minimal data transfer, and are feasible to implement in
    outdoor facilities. There are several data transmission standards and protocols,
    including SigFox,1 LoRa,2 and ZigBee,3 which meet these characteristics. In the
    first scenario, we designed an infrastructure with nodes using ZigBee. This choice
    was made because ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate
    technologies for the agriculture and farming domains.18, 20 Although according
    to its specification it reaches 100 meters, in real use environments, ZigBee does
    not allow transmission distances greater than 60 meters outdoors.38 This is a
    big issue for deploying IoT infrastructures in outdoor crops, and thus, we decide
    to use the LoRa communication protocol. Among the advantages of technology, we
    may highlight the low power consumption and the great coverage it is able to reach.
    The choice to use LoRa instead of Sigfox is based on the possibility of deploying
    your own network, as Sigfox imposes certain restrictions on its use. 3.2 IoT sensor
    hardware description The workflow starts at the sensor level where the climate
    data information is collected. The hardware architecture of the sensor network
    is the 4H remote control system of the company Hidroconta.4 Figure 2 shows the
    IoT node developed by this company. The IoT node incorporates temperature, humidity,
    and wind speed sensors. These sensors have been calibrated by the company, so
    we have not had to perform any calibration phase. The sensors are connected to
    the analog inputs available on the IoT node, which can be expanded with as many
    sensors as required, while the actuator is connected to one of the four outputs
    for 12 V latch solenoid valves. The sensors and the actuator used in the proposed
    IoT solution are the following. Humidity sensor: The humidity sensor also measures
    temperature, the implanted model is the P3110E from COMET5(see Figure 3A). With
    a temperature range of -30°C to 80°C with an error of ± 0.6°C and a humidity range
    of 0 to 100% with an error of ±3%). Temperature sensor: The temperature sensor
    is the model 60P8610 from COMET (see Figure 3B). The temperature range is from
    -20°C to 60°C with a resolution of 0.1°C. Wind speed sensor: This sensor is the
    model PCE-WS A from the company PCE Instruments6(see Figure 3C). It has a measurement
    range between 3 and 180 Km/h with an error of ± 1 Km/h. Figure 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint IoT node Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensors and
    actuators of the IoT node. A, Humidity sensor; B, Temperature sensor; C, Wind
    speed sensor; D, Actuator (valve) The most important variable to address the frost
    prediction is the air temperature, but other variables such as humidity or wind
    speed are also relevant in this domain. Including more variables offer the possibility
    to create more accurate models and thus, being able to predict the frost earlier.
    Moreover, sometimes it is also necessary to measure the same variable several
    times in different places. This is the case with temperature, where height can
    change the capture value. In our case, the humidity sensor measures both the humidity
    and air temperature. Having two temperature sensors helps us to detect outliers
    and/or temperature errors and, on the other hand, it increases the possibility
    of detecting the lowest temperature to activate the anti-frost technique as soon
    as possible. One of the IoT communication nodes also has an actuator connected
    to it that activates and deactivates the anti-frost sprinkler technique, specifically,
    a lach-type solenoid (see Figure 3D). Among its characteristics, we may highlight
    the existence of 3 direct action ways, resistance of up to 80°C and 12 bar of
    pressure. Beyond sensors and actuators, the IoT node also has hardware dedicated
    to connectivity where the sensors are connected. An important aspect is that one
    of the IoT nodes acts as a gateway to send data to the cloud via GPRS connection,
    while the others connect to it using LoRa technology. All of them are autonomous
    since they have a battery 6 volts (V) and 12 amp (A) per hour and a solar panel
    of 12 V and 5 watts (W). More than sufficient capacities as the consumption in
    “low” mode is 126μA and 19mA with GPRS connection. Finally, each IoT node has
    a micro controller with 256 KB of firmware storage and 96 KB of volatile memory
    for data. The latter can be expanded with a non-volatile external memory of 244
    KB, and thus store up to 20.000 records. Therefore, each node, in addition to
    sending the information to the gateway, stores the information in its memory so
    that if there is a failure in the communication it can be forwarded once it is
    restored. 3.3 IoT intelligent component There are many applications where real-time
    data mining of sensor data to make intelligent decisions is essential.39 One of
    this application is the approach proposed in this study for monitoring low temperatures
    in crops. Data measured and collected by WSNs is often unreliable and inaccurate.24
    The quality of data set might be affected by noise and error such as missing values,
    duplicated data, or inconsistent data. The quality of this data is due to the
    fact that the low cost and low quality sensor nodes have stringent resource constraints
    such as energy (battery power), memory, computational capacity, and communication
    bandwidth. Besides, operations of sensor nodes are frequently susceptible to environmental
    effects. Thus, it is inevitable that in such environments some sensor nodes do
    not work properly, which may result in noisy, faulty, missing, and redundant data,
    being this type of data called outliers. The prediction of frost temperatures
    needs reliable and error-free data; therefore, it is necessary to apply a processing
    technique to these data to avoid creating confusion and errors in the IoT system
    proposed and implicitly to the farmer. This work proposes two different algorithms
    for outlier detection within this context; they are as follows: (1) k-nearest
    neighbors and (2) k-means clustering information. With these techniques, we not
    only detect outliers, but we also eliminate/transform these outlier in useful
    information. These two techniques are within the categorization presented in Section
    2. Considering the profile of the problem and the rejection that exists in some
    farmers to the implementation of the new technology and after analyzing the different
    outliers detection techniques, these two techniques have been selected based on
    their interpretability and their easy explanation of its operation without going
    into technical details. Neighborhood-based outlier detection The neighborhood-based
    outlier detection is a lightweight technique which combines the same variables
    from different IoT nodes. As mentioned above, each IoT node is equipped with two
    temperature sensors (the humidity sensor also measures the temperature). This
    provides temperatures at different heights and allows a real-time outlier checking.
    Moreover, each IoT node stores its closest neighbors to compare its measurements
    with those taken by its neighbors. Each time a new IoT node is introduced into
    the network, it notifies all IoT nodes within a radius to be included as a neighbor.
    This avoids performing the search every time a value has to be checked. The process
    of verification of the distance can be done offline without penalizing the proposed
    system. It is noteworthy to highlight that the distance here also takes into account
    the altitude at which the sensor is located as this is a relevant parameter in
    temperature. Therefore, the distance between IoT nodes is always displayed taking
    into account the latitude, longitude, and altitude in the different part of plots
    and experience of the farmer. Algorithm 1 shows the general scheme of the outlier
    detection technique of the nearest neighbor. This technique uses the two nearest
    neighbors, being 1 − KNN the air temperature sensor of the IoT node and 2 − KNN
    the nearest neighbor in distance that is not deployed in the IoT node. This decision
    to use only two nearest neighbors is supported by previous experiments, where
    it was tested that when using information from distant neighbors, the outliers
    value was distorted, introducing even more noise in the data. Thus, for each temperature,
    the difference between the temperature of the node T (node under evaluation) with
    the temperature of the node T1 − KNN (outlier1) and with the temperature of the
    node T2 − KNN (outlier2) is calculated. When the temperature T is less than 1.0°C
    from the nearest neighbor, there is no outlier. If the temperature T is greater
    than 1.0°C from its nearest neighbor (1 − KNN) and less than 2.5°C from its second
    nearest neighbor (2 − KNN), there is an outlier and the temperature shown by the
    system is the average of the two neighbors. If these two conditions are not given,
    then it is an outlier, but its second nearest neighbor (2 − KNN) can contain another
    outlier; therefore, the temperature of the nearest neighbor is assigned as the
    output of the system. The thresholds of 1.0°C and 2.5°C have been established
    on the basis of experimental evidence and farmers'' opinions and assessments.
    K-means clustering The k-means40 is a well-known clustering technique, which is
    heavyweight, computationally speaking. It is an iterative procedure widely used
    in pattern recognition and data mining to search for statistical structures in
    data. It is an unsupervised data mining algorithm to make cluster from high-dimensional
    data. Given a data matrix composed of observations and variables, the objective
    is to cluster the observations into groups that are internally homogeneous and
    heterogeneous from group to group. The k of the k-means clustering method indicates
    the number of groups, which is actually an input parameter in the algorithm. The
    k-means algorithm establishes prototypes or centroids, which are points that represents
    each cluster. To decide which point belongs to each cluster, the k-means uses
    the Euclidean distance as a measure of the similarity between observations and
    clusters. The traditional algorithm uses an iterative refinement. Given an initial
    set of k clusters (c1,c2,…,ck) where k is an input parameter, the algorithm alternates
    two main steps. Assignment step where each point is assigned to the “closest”
    cluster, ie, the cluster with the least squared Euclidean distance between the
    cluster prototype and the point. Update step calculates the new means to be the
    prototypes of the new clusters. The k-means algorithm has been used in the literature
    for improving the outlier removal.41, 42 Actually, the term outlier is categorized
    into two new concepts (Internal and External outlier) when clustering techniques
    are applied to identify them. External outlier is when the outlier is an element
    of the group which has few data and is located far from other groups. Internal
    outlier is a point that belongs to a particular group but is located far from
    the centroid. In this work, we focus on the internal outliers, since in this context,
    the external outliers do not make sense because there is a large amount of data
    increasingly generated each hour to be analyzed. Once the corresponding clusters
    have been obtained by means of K-means, the outlier value x is detected as follows.
    The cluster c corresponding to the value x is assigned. The maximum distance between
    each centroid and the furthest value xf belonging to that cluster is calculated,
    taking into account the signs. An outlier value can be detected by low or high
    temperature. This distance is called Max. If the distance of x to the centroid
    of c is greater than Maxc and in addition the distance between x and is greater
    than 1°C, then the value is considered outlier. The outlier is corrected taking
    as value the centroid value of the cluster. This K-means technique is highly parallel
    as the Euclidean distance calculation between points and clusters can be fully
    performed in parallel. Some works have proposed parallel implementations of the
    k-means algorithm in different platforms, including mutlicore CPUs, GPUs, and
    FPGAs.43-45 Actually, the RAPIDS library recently announced by Nvidia46 includes
    k-means as an accelerated method for clustering observations. In this work, we
    use three different implementations of k-means for outlier removal; they are sequential
    implementation in ANSI C to run on single-thread CPUs, multicore implementation
    using OpenMP47 and GPU implementation using CUDA.48 When a sensor repeatedly obtains
    outliers during an hour of monitoring, this means that the IoT node is inactive
    and their values are not used to make decisions. In the test phase, we have implemented
    the KNN outliers detection technique in some sensors and the K-means technique
    in others to analyse the efficiency, speed, and quality of the results. Once the
    data is pre-processed to ensure data reliability, then the IoT actuators are activated
    if the temperature is less than or equal to 3.0°C. This decision rule is made
    by the experience and knowledge of experts in the field (agronomists). The rule
    is based on the need to moisten the entire crop area before the temperature drops
    from zero in order to make the anti-frost technique more effective. When the actuator
    is activated, the irrigation valve is opened, which allows the application of
    the anti-frost sprinkler irrigation technique. The IoT system deactivates the
    actuators when the following two scenarios occur. When negative temperatures have
    occurred and after these negative temperatures occur two hours with positive temperatures
    above 7°C. When temperatures do not become negative, but are below 2.5°C, and
    spend two hours with temperatures above or equal to 4°C. The actuators are activated
    again if the 2.5°C rule is met. These temperature thresholds have been established
    on the basis of the experiments carried out by the farmers and it should be noted
    that, in the tests carried out with the IoT system proposed in this manuscript,
    the results have been positive using these thresholds. 3.4 Monitoring interface
    The monitoring interface provides interpretability and simplicity to reach the
    end user of the system. It must be appreciated that many farmers may not be familiar
    with the technology; hence, the development of the monitoring interface must be
    friendly. For the development of this monitoring interface, there was the possibility
    to choose between open source IoT platforms as Kaa,7 Fiware,8 and ThingSpeak,9
    between others. However, due to the particularity of the problem presented, the
    application of outlier detection, the configuration of specific alerts that farmers
    demand, and the activation of the irrigation valves, an ad-hoc monitoring interface
    has been developed. This allows us to add the specific preferences for each farmer
    and to configure the alarms or conditions that are necessary to avoid damage to
    crops due to frost. Figures 4A and 4B show a part of the administration panel
    of the IoT monitoring system. It shows the data related to a plot containing four
    IoT nodes active. The location data of the IoT nodes has been altered to avoid
    the exact location of the nodes for privacy reasons. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Monitoring interface for the intelligent system. A, Temperature view;
    B, Humidity view In the calendar icon, the user can pick a day and the interface
    will show the sensor selected in the map (Figure 4A, air temperature sensors,
    and Figure 4B, humidity sensor). Each user has his/her own personalized administration
    panel. These figures show the farmer has available the number of active nodes,
    the minimum and maximum value of the sensor, and the current value. This monitoring
    interface has been developed using NodeJS and AngularJS technologies. As a database
    manager, we work with MySQL 5.7, which allows us to store data of JSON type. This
    allows us to simplify the process of data manipulation. In addition, we have implemented
    a MongoDB database to increase system scalability. 3.5 Deployment of the IoT monitoring
    system The IoT system has been deployed in two plots of the Region of Murcia (Spain).
    The IoT nodes are actively working to date. This deployment was carried out according
    to farmers'' requirements due to the temperature difference between the canopies
    and the trunk of the trees. The IoT nodes are implanted in a 2-meter high stainless
    steel support. The wind speed and temperature sensors are located in the upper
    part (see Figure 5A). The humidity sensor is integrated in the part of the IoT
    node (see Figure 5B) that is protected from rainfall with its corresponding insulators
    to prevent it from getting wet and sending erroneous data. In addition, the display
    has one of the IoT nodes connected to the valve (the IoT actuator), which opens
    and closes to activate or deactivate the anti-frost technique (see Figure 5C).
    Each plot has a actuator deployed, and three IoT nodes each with with two temperature
    sensors, ie, one for humidity and wind speed. The two temperature sensors of the
    same IoT node are at different heights in the support, and all the IoT nodes have
    the same configuration, although it is possible to define different heights for
    each sensor. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A, Deployment of an IoT
    node with the three sensors in a real environment; B, Detail of the displayed
    humidity sensor; C, Deployment of the actuating IoT node in a real environment
    The proposed IoT system was put into operation at the beginning of October of
    2017 and the data used in these assessment experiments are related to the month
    of November and December 2017 and January, February, March, November, and December
    2018; and January and February 2019. We have to take into account for the frost
    domain that we are interesting to analyzed and tested low temperatures. The IoT
    nodes pick up temperatures 24 hours a day with a frequency between 5 and 10 minutes.
    However, to assess the behavior, we rely on the temperatures collected between
    5 pm a day and 12 am hours a day following. Thus, analyzing the temperatures in
    this range, we avoid problems with high temperatures at midday since these temperatures
    can be influenced by the position of the IoT nodes, ie, whether these nodes are
    in the sun or not. It is worth mentioning that this IoT infrastructure is designed
    to be scalable. The user can include as IoT nodes as desired, and it can include
    more sensors per IoT node using expansion slots. This offers the possibility to
    apply this infrastructure in different agricutlural context. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    This section shows the results of the proposed IoT solution to address the problem
    of reducing frost damage to crops. It is structured as follows. First of all,
    we motivate the need of deploying an IoT system to deal with the frost problem
    instead of relying on coarse-grained forecast systems, where the predictions expand
    to a wide geographical area. The IoT infrastructure is then evaluated in several
    ways, ie, (1) the most appropriate frequency and position (height) for collecting
    temperatures are analyzed to determine the best sensor configuration and (2) the
    intelligent component of IoT is evaluated from the quality''s (outlier''s removal)
    and performance''s (edge vs cloud approach) point of views. 4.1 Global vs local
    temperature General weather forecasting has several limitations. Among them, we
    may highlight the following: (1) the measurements are generally provided hourly
    and (2) it is a coarse-grained prediction based on weather station at a given
    location. The prevention of frost requires real-time information for the particular
    area where the crops are located. Figure 6A shows a comparison between the temperature
    measurements made by the proposed IoT infrastructure and the predictions made
    from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and the OpenWeather website10between
    21.00 hours on January 10, 2019 and 11.00 hours on January 13, 2019. Although
    the trend is quite similar, there are significant differences between them. Openweather''s
    prediction is less accurate than AEMET''s; AEMET''s prediction still differs greatly
    from in situ IoT infrastructure. Particularly detrimental to us are the differences
    in low temperatures, as such a deviation could mean the loss of the crop. Moreover,
    our IoT temperature information is also compared to weather stations that provide
    real-time information. These stations belong to the Murcian institute for agricultural
    and food research and development (IMIDA).11 In particular, the two IMIDA stations
    closest to the crop are selected, ie, CI22 and JU81. These stations are located
    at a maximum distance of 10 km from the IoT infrastructure. Figure 6B shows that
    there are still big differences with the actual temperature collected by our IoT
    infrastructure. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparative of global
    and local temperatures. A, Global temperature prediction vs local real temperature;
    B, Global real temperature vs local real temperature 4.2 Difference of temperature
    according to height and frequency capture Figure 7 shows temperature variation
    when it is measured at different frequencies, ie, 10 and 5 minutes. This is commonly
    used frequencies for collecting temperatures in different IoT scenarios such as
    IMIDA. As the frequency of data collection increases, more information becomes
    available and, therefore, additional patterns could be detected. Whenever the
    temperature begins to drop, the 5-minute temperature appears to indicate the trend
    to the next temperature, although this does not have to happen in all cases. For
    example, the temperature at 3:04 am was 0.79°C; 5 minutes later, the temperature
    was 0.94°C; and at 3:14 am, it was 1.08°C, so the intermediate reading at 5 minutes
    indicates that the temperature was rising. Therefore, the frequency has been set
    every 5 minutes to provide greater information, an accuracy in displaying temperatures
    and warning farmers of possible frost early, and to activate the anti-frost technique.
    Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparative of IoT nodes collect temperature
    frequencies every 5 to 10 minutes Figure 8 shows the air temperatures for sensors
    A and B where sensor A is located higher than sensor. As explained above, the
    proposed IoT infrastructure is composed of up to two IoT nodes at different heights
    (see Figure 5). Temperature differences of these sensors never exceed one degree
    Celsius. For instance, from 2:42 am to 3:52 am, the sensor A had a higher temperature
    than the sensor B. This is not a single event, but it occurs several times. Moreover,
    it is worth highlighting that the biggest temperature differences occur at 1:12
    am and 3:02 am. In addition, it should be noted that the greatest temperature
    differences occur at 1:12 am and 3:02 am. Having information at several heights
    enriches the information available for decision-making. A degree of temperature
    difference can mean the loss of the crop, and thus, it is important to activate
    the antifreeze techniques in the worst-case scenario. Figure 8 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Temperature comparison of sensors at different heights 4.3 Assessing
    the IoT intelligent component As described in Section 5, the IoT intelligent component
    is composed of two outlier detection techniques based on the KNN and k-means algorithms.
    The detection of outliers in this system is a fundamental task due to the possible
    errors that sensors may have. Actually, outliers are a common problem in agriculture
    due to the harsh weather conditions in which IoT infrastructures are deployed.
    This section evaluates the intelligent component of the IoT infrastructure proposed.
    To perform this evaluation in parallel, two sensors have implemented the outlier
    detection technique based on K-means and the rest of sensors have used the KNN
    technique because the latter technique requires some neighbors to check its feasibility.
    Figures 9A and 9B show ten temperatures relative to January 6, 2018 between 22:20
    and 23:55 hours. The dots in bold represent outliers. Figure 9A shows the raw
    temperatures that includes the outlier values. Figure 9B shows the outlier values
    corrected by the KNN technique (see Algorithm 1). In Figure 9A, the temperatures
    marked as outliers are 5.36°C and 2.36°C. The KNN replaces these values by 4.02°C
    and 4.65°C, respectively. The former is replaced by 1-KNN and the latter is calculated
    by the average of the temperatures between 1-KNN and 2-KNN. If these outliers
    are not corrected, the actuators (valves) would be activated incorrectly, resulting
    in a loss of resources. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A, Air temperature
    detecting outlier with KNN technique; B, Air temperature with the outlier corrected
    with KNN technique; C, Air temperature detecting outlier with K-means technique;
    D, Air temperature with the outlier corrected with K-means technique Figures 9C
    and 9D show the five clusters made for one sensor by the k-means algorithm during
    January 7, 2018 between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. of the following day. Clusters
    are built using data from 1 month prior to that date and are updated if necessary
    each time a new value is collected. The outlier detected between 22.00 and 23.00
    hours corresponds to a temperature of 0.6°C. The outlier is detected since the
    temperature obtained by the sensor is higher than 1.0°C with respect to the maximum
    distance between the temperature furthest from the centroid. The value of the
    corrected outliers is the centroid value of the cluster to which this value belongs
    to. The K-means algorithm requires much more information than KNN for the detection
    of outliers, but it provides a higher accuracy. 4.4 Cloud vs edge computing The
    k-means algorithm is a more accurate tool for outlier detection, but it is computationally
    expensive. In the agriculture application domain, the lack of connectivity, the
    low-bandwidth connection is big trouble when IoT analytics services are deployed.
    Therefore, this section analyzes the k-means algorithm from the computational
    point of view. Computational experiments have been carried out considering the
    IoT infrastructure under study where cloud and edge computing approaches are evaluated.
    For the cloud-based approach, the IoT infrastructure is connected to a computational
    back-end called Heterolistic, which includes two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5-2650
    at 2.20 GHz, 128 GB of RAM, private L1 and L2 caches of 32 KB and 256 KB per node,
    and a L3 cache of 32 MB shared by all the cores of a socket. Moreover, it includes
    two GPUs, ie, Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti (Pascal), with 12 GB and 3584 cores (28 SM and
    128 SP per SM), and an Nvidia TITAN X (Maxwell) with 3072 (24 SM and 128 SP per
    SM) cores and 12 GB of Global Memory. For the edge computing evaluation, the nodes
    are System on Chip (SoC) based on Nvidia Jetson family. Particularly, Jetson TK1
    and TX1 are under evaluation. The NVIDIA Tegra K1 SoC uses an NVIDIA Kepler GPU
    core (192 CUDA cores) with NVIDIA 4-Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU, 2 GB x16 Memory
    with 64-bit Width, and 16 GB 4.51 eMMC Memory. The NVIDIA Tegra X1 SoC uses an
    NVIDIA Maxwell GPU core (256 CUDA cores) and 4-Quad-Core ARM A57/2 MB L2, 4 GB
    64 bit LPDDR4 (25.6 GB/s), and 16 GB eMMC, SDIO, SATA. A set of hydrometeorological
    data with up to 239 108 instances is used for the evaluation, each with a maximum
    of 13 variables. The data set contains hourly information from January 2012 to
    April 2018 for the following variables: mean humidity, maximum humidity, minimum
    humidity, mean radiation, maximum radiation, mean wind speed, maximum wind speed,
    mean wind direction, precipitation, mean pressure vapour deficit, dew point, difference
    with the mean temperature of one hour from the previous hour, and minimum temperature.
    Figure 10 shows the execution time in seconds of the k-means algorithm for the
    target dataset. Three different multicore architectures (Jetson TK1, Jetson TX1,
    and Heterolistic) are analyzed by varying the number of threads. The highest performance
    is achieved with 8 threads in Jetson TK1, 4 threads in Jetson TX1, and 32 threads
    in Heterolistic. The speed-up factor between Jetson architectures is up to 1.5x
    and between Jetson TX1 and Heterolistic is almost 7x (Heterolistic classifies
    this dataset in 0,794 seconds and Jetson TX1 in 5,467 seconds). Therefore, the
    cloud-based approach offers much better performance than Jetson nodes and they
    are designed to be power-efficiency. From now on, we focus our performance evaluation
    on Jetson TX1 as it provides better performance than the previous generation.
    Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Execution time in seconds of the k-means
    algorithm running 1000 iterations, four clusters, and a hydrometeorological dataset
    with 13 variables and 239 108 instances Figure 11 shows the execution time in
    seconds (logarithmic scale) of k-means algorithm running 1000 iterations for the
    hydrometeorological dataset with 239 108 instances. The number of variables goes
    from 1 to 13 and the number of clusters is in the range of (2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32,
    64, 128, and 256). Notice that the performance of this code is mainly affected
    by the number of clusters to be performed, the number variables and registers.
    The cloud-server (Hetorolistic) defeats by a wide margin the low-power consumption
    architecture Jetson Tx1, generally speaking. The speed-up factor first quartile
    is 2,3x, the median is 4,3x, and the third quartile is 6,2x for all benchmarking
    configurations. However, the lack of connectivity and the low-bandwidth connections
    in agriculture scenarios may justify the possibility to compute on the edge for
    some cases. Particularly, there is up to 25% of the cases where the performance
    gap is only 2,3x (Q1) which can be hidden by the network overhead. The lowest
    differences in performance between both platforms are found when those variables
    are relatively small. Network latency tests have been carried out using the PingTools
    program,49 obtaining rates higher than 2 seconds. Although the device used for
    them is an Android phone configured to send through the GPRS network, the data
    obtained is considered better than what can be achieved by measuring directly
    on the device of the communications node. Therefore, it is not contradicted the
    hypothesis that the computation in the device is more optimal for the scenario
    that is described in this article. Figure 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    1 to 13) and clusters (2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256) is modified to analyze
    the behaviour of both Heterolistic and Jetson Tx1 under different workloads 5
    CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Climate change is causing trees bloom earlier and
    the sudden changes in temperature can lead to severe economic damage to farmers,
    since freezing flowers and spoiling crops. In this article, we have proposed and
    deployed a high-performance IoT system to reduce frost damages in stone fruit.
    We design the whole IoT infrastructure in a technological hostile area, which
    includes sensors/actuators, a wireless sensor network, an intelligent component
    to detect outliers in real time, and a monitor interface. Regarding the intelligent
    component, two different algorithms to remove outliers are designed, ie, the KNN
    and k-menans. The latter provides better quality results, but it is a heavy workload
    that is well-suited for parallelization. Therefore, a comparison between cloud-edge
    approaches to perform the k-means algorithm is provided. Different low-power GPU-based
    computing architectures based on Nvidia Jetson architectures are analyzed at the
    edge on this IoT infrastructure. Indeed, the cloud-based architecture offers higher
    performance in general, but edge computing is not too far away from it computationally
    speaking, and therefore, we really believe that it is a compelling alternative
    to mask transient cloud outages and provide highly responsive data analytic services
    in such technologically hostile environments. After the evaluation of the goodness
    of the IoT system, this is deployed and operating in a real environment giving
    positive and satisfactory results and covering the needs of farmers facing the
    problem of frost. We acknowledge that the classification algorithms pointed out
    in this work are very basic and other classification algorithms, such as those
    within the umbrella of deep learning, could obtain better results. However, the
    computational requirements of these promising algorithms may be too high for this
    emerging landscape of computation and the power consumption may be a limiting
    factor. Increasing the computing requirements would require a broader evaluation
    of edge computing platforms in terms of performance and power consumption. We
    definitely believe this is an interesting tradeoff to evaluate in future work.

    • Technology is an integral component of many of the proposed mitigation measures.
    • There exists an urgent need for education on e-waste impact on the environment.
    • Greater focus is needed on responsible digitalization to engender sustained
    change. • Alignment of smart initiatives to SDGs is an underdeveloped research
    area. • Greater awareness is needed on lived in realities of environmental tradeoffs.
    Abstract The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for
    world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing
    emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
    by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental
    and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective
    where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential
    solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore
    these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based
    insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges
    through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its
    forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and
    wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly,
    researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate
    the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral
    component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires
    pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate
    friendly society. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Climate

    Development Goals (SDGs) 1. Introduction The 2021 United Nations (UN) Climate
    Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow UK, brings together many of the worlds’
    leaders to address the critical aspects of global warming. The conference aims
    to gain commitment for sustained progress towards the Paris Agreement and UN framework
    convention on climate change, by limiting increased global temperatures to 1.5
    °C above pre-industrial levels (COP26, 2021). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) identified in its 2018 report that global emissions would need to
    be at net zero by at least 2050 to retain a “high confidence” level of limiting
    temperature increases to sustainable levels (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). In
    her speech at the conference, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that -
    “rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive
    economies," and that "addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity
    of our time." (COP26, 2021). The transition toward net zero requires significant
    changes at a societal and industrial level and governments, as well as corporations,
    are increasingly turning to technological innovations to meet net zero emission
    targets (Miller, 2020). Digital technologies offer the potential to deliver sustained
    solutions to many of the seemingly intractable societal challenges relating to
    climate change (George, Merrill, & Schillebeeckx, 2021). The World Economic Forum
    (WEF) in its - Harnessing Technology for the Global Goals report, jointly authored
    with PwC, identifies the significant role that digital technology can play in
    improving resilience to global warming related, natural hazards, reducing emissions
    and enhancing the ability for humans to take the necessary steps to realize net
    zero. The WEF report identifies how digital technologies can help to automate
    and significantly improve the efficiency of industrial, manufacturing and agricultural
    processes and that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems could contribute
    to a reduction of 4% in global emissions by 2030 (World Economic Forum & PwC,
    2021). Although advancements in technologies are closely associated with offering
    solutions to global warming, the digital discourse also highlights the negative
    impacts of the widespread use of technology in the context of waste products,
    resource usage and CO2 emissions. The widely reported impact of vast bitcoin mining
    farms in various parts of the world and their appetite for significant energy
    consumption - 121.36 terawatts hours per year (CBECI, 2021) – illustrates the
    dichotomy of rapid technological advancement and potential barriers to net zero
    by 2050 (Mora et al., 2018). The debates surrounding the convergence of the digital
    and net zero imperatives are beginning to gain traction within the academic literature,
    where studies have started to focus on the role of digital technologies through
    a positive contribution lens, but also a reflective perspective, recognizing some
    of the negative aspects of the rapid adoption of technology (George et al., 2021,
    Merrill et al., 2019). What is clear is that, whilst the emerging diverse and
    disparate discourse has offered insight to many of the significant challenges
    and barriers to net zero from the digital perspective (George et al., 2016, Luo
    et al., 2016), there exists a limited contribution from a wider and more informed
    multiple perspective context. This study contributes to the digital technology
    and climate change discourse, via the individual discussions on a multitude of
    interrelated sub-topics. Each invited expert has offered their own unique insight
    to the myriad of complexities and dependencies to attaining net zero by 2050.
    The remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    a brief review of existing literature in this space. Section 3 presents the experts’
    perspectives related to core themes surrounding information management (IM)/information
    technology (IT)/information systems (IS) and climate change. Section 4 - presents
    an overview of the key perspectives from the submitted full opinion articles.
    The main discussion section is presented in Section 5, where we assess the significant
    challenges and key contributions from the invited expert submissions. Section
    6 concludes the paper by discussing implications for both research and practice.
    2. Background literature review The primary database used for the literature search
    was Scopus. Keywords such as “information systems” or “information technology”
    or “IT sector” were combined (AND operator) with keywords “environment”, “sustainability”,
    “sustainable” and “climate”. The search taxonomy retrieved articles that had the
    combination of keywords in the article title, author keywords, or abstract. Via
    a process of filtering to eliminate non-relevant studies, a total of 372 articles
    remained. These articles were evaluated via their abstract to assess their suitability
    against the following two research questions. • RQ1: Does the digital technology
    and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment and how can it be reduced?
    • RQ2: How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? After a further process of scanning of the title
    and abstract for the relevance of the article to the research questions, 88 articles
    remained. Additionally, ScienceDirect and Web of Science were also used, following
    similar approaches which resulted in 16 additional articles. 2.1. (RQ1) Does the
    digital technology and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment
    and how can it be reduced? Despite the contribution of the IS/IT industry toward
    the economic and social welfare of society, IS/IT has often been criticized for
    having a negative environmental impact. Concerns surrounding the adverse effects
    both hardware and software have on the environment date back to the Y2K era which
    led to the massive adoption of enterprise systems (Miyamoto, Harada, & Fujimoto,
    2001). These negative impacts include high levels of energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions and toxic disposal of IS/IT systems (Muregesan, 2008). The disposal
    of electronic waste (e-waste) while following recycling processes has been widely
    viewed as not being environmentally friendly, especially the impact of fossil
    fuels or respiratory inorganics (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Diaz, & Hopp, 2008).
    Refurbished ICTs are often used in developing countries where devices tend to
    have a short life-span and subsequently create environmental damage during disposal
    (Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). Studies have argued that electricity is a major cause
    of climate change, as many power stations throughout the world still rely on fossil
    fuels to generate electricity (Asongu et al., 2020, Tamburini et al., 2015). Energy
    hungry technologies such as applications of blockchain in the form of bitcoin,
    has been widely criticized for producing over 22–29 million metric tonnes of carbon
    dioxide emission each year. These figures are comparable to the carbon dioxide
    production of entire countries such as Jordan and Sri Lanka (Marr, 2018, Stoll
    et al., 2019). Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and
    actuators have a shorter lifespan which leads to increased waste in the environment
    (Chakraborty and Gupta, 2016, Chakraborty et al., 2014, Nižetić et al., 2020).
    Digital transformation initiatives such as smart cities have concerns surrounding
    ICT waste management, energy management and emission management which needs to
    be addressed for achieving long term sustainability and viability (Ismagilova,
    Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). From an IS/IT perspective, IoT and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) could potentially offer solutions for reducing the impact of
    technology projects (Salam, 2020). High ICT-driven initiatives need to plan for
    sustainability by thinking from the perspective of social welfare and e-waste
    impact (Kar, Ilavarasan, Gupta, Janssen, & Kothari, 2019). Wireless communication
    technologies need adaptations so that emissions can be further reduced. AI can
    operate with such technologies to enhance the usage of bandwidth and energy consumption
    to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector Ullah et al.
    (2020). Similarly, AI integrated with blockchain has been found to positively
    impact water management and climate control (Lin, Petway, Lien, & Settele, 2018).
    AI can manage and reduce energy consumption within smart cities (Şerban & Lytras,
    2020). Studies have identified that blockchain applications can improve sustainable
    practices in supply chain management and agricultural practices (Kshetri, 2021).
    Similarly, within nano-technology applications, AI has provided benefits through
    better precision in agricultural water distribution delivering positive impacts
    on efficient use of natural resources. The communication of sustainability related
    messages within social media has greatly increased during the pandemic (Grover
    et al., 2019, Grover et al., 2021, Yadav et al., 2021). The literature has highlighted
    that during crisis periods IS research can provide “signposting” for sustainability
    actions through improved digital monitoring, tackling information flow and paranoia,
    and orchestrating data ecosystems for improved decision making (Pan & Zhang, 2020).
    The focus towards renewable energy has increased dramatically. The IRENA (2021)
    report indicates that jobs in sustainability and cleaner energy are increasing
    exponentially year on year, especially in solar and wind energy. This shift towards
    greener energy consumption is common across industries producing and consuming
    technology products and services. There is evidence that if stakeholders are convinced
    about energy management, their engagement in Green IS/IT programs will increase
    (Nyberg, 2018). The literature highlights the use of theories such as: Institutional
    Theory, Resource Based View, Technology Organization Environment framework, Theory
    of Planned Behavior and Motivational Theory as the dominant models used in the
    IS literature (Asadi & Dahlan, 2017). Lesser used theoretical lenses such as:
    Upper Echelon Theory, Self Determination Theory, Green Theory, Norm Activation
    Model, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Dynamic Capability Theory, Actor-Network
    Theory and Expectancy Theory. could be used to explore future research relating
    to environmental impacts of technology. (Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. Snapshot

    2.2. (RQ2) How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? As early as 2008, Murugesan (2008) provided directions
    towards a greener IS/IT strategy. A holistic focus towards Greener IT entails
    reducing the energy consumption of computational devices. It also gives directions
    on reuse, refurbish and recycling of IS/IT products. Such a focus requires an
    organizational imperative as indicated by Butler (2011), whereby the study draws
    on institutional theory to explain the multitude of forces acting on organizations
    from the institutional, environment and organizational fields for environmental
    sustainability. Reduction of carbon based energy consumption directly leads to
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The study by Simmonds and Bhattacherjee
    (2012) indicates that existing IT infrastructure, alignment of business strategy
    and relative advantages of green IT initiatives, have an overall positive impact
    on the adoption of IT initiatives within firms. Recent IT/IS literature indicates
    that technology can be a solution for better environmental management and sustainability.
    For example, Wang X. (2015), Wang Y. (2015) highlights that IS/IT competence enables
    the integration of technology within the environmental management processes to
    improve performance. The same study demonstrated the positive impact of IT competence
    on IT-environmental management integration. The research by Jnr (2020) indicates
    that there is a significant relationship between integrated technologies and Green
    IS/IT innovation. The study by Ojo and Fauzi (2020) indicates that environmental
    awareness and leadership commitment positively impacts engagement in Green IS/IT
    practices. Further Marques et al. (2019) highlight that universities now consider
    emissions and Green IT principles to reduce the adverse impacts on the climate,
    while designing their curriculum. Audits in Green IT in enterprises help to enhance
    focus towards maintaining environmental orientation and better impacts on climate
    (Patón-Romero et al., 2021). These audits offer a view on the organization''s
    position along the green IT capability maturity model from ISO/IEC 15504 to ISO/IEC
    33000. Within workplace infrastructure management, sensors and actuators are often
    being used for water management and energy consumption in smart buildings (toilet
    management, ventilation and air quality management) and smart devices (like air
    conditioners and lighting systems). These technologies have been observed to have
    brought in wide positive impacts on the climate within the existing literature
    (Zarindast, Sharma, & Wood, 2021). For example, blockchain applications are not
    always energy hungry, and often applications in different use cases such as SolarCoin
    and VerdePay may actually help in reducing carbon footprints (Howson, 2019). Applications
    of analytical models for information management enables more efficient energy
    management in smart cities (Gellert, Florea, Fiore, Palmieri, & Zanetti, 2019).
    Blockchain applications may enable a more efficient IoT ecosystem and thereby
    reduce energy consumption (Sharma et al., 2020). AI technologies such as deep
    learning together with big data analytics have been used for image mining for
    underwater environment management and air quality management (Kushwaha et al.,
    2021, Nair et al., 2021). Driven by the pandemic, working from home has significantly
    increased, which has drastically reduced travel to workplaces, thereby reducing
    the carbon footprint from travel and maintaining office infrastructure. This change
    toward a work from home culture has been facilitated using video conferencing
    and collaboration systems enabled through ICTs (Chakraborty and Kar, 2021, Galanti
    et al., 2021, Richter, 2020). A recent review on AI and its possible impacts towards
    sustainability argue that AI will play a critical role beyond enabling better
    consumption of energy, water, and land usage, and it will facilitate environmental
    governance with greater effectiveness (Nishant et al., 2020). Whilst the literature
    has exhibited an emerging focus on Green IS and sustainability within the information
    management literature, there is still tremendous scope for impactful research
    on many aspects of the use of technology to combat climate change. 3. Multiple
    perspectives from invited contributors This section, in alignment with the approach
    set out in previous studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021a, Dwivedi et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), develops a set of
    unique expert contribution narratives that explore many of the key topics related
    to digital and IS technologies and climate change. This topic has numerous threads
    and interdependencies as many of the invited experts offer their own perspectives
    and viewpoints on the topic. The expert contributions are largely presented in
    an unedited form, as expressed by each of the contributors. The perceived unevenness
    of the logical flow inherent with this approach is countered by the capturing
    of the distinctive orientations of the expert perspectives related to the chosen
    topic (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015). The list of contributions is provided in

    Johan Olaisen 3.1. Behavior and attitudes 3.1.1. Contribution 1 – Climate change
    and information technology – Professor Robert M. Davison 3.1.1.1. Some issues
    I think that IM/IT/IS has a profoundly negative impact on the environment in ways
    that are largely invisible. For instance, the devices that we use, particularly
    batteries, require the inclusion of rare earth elements, notably tantalum. This
    is mined from Coltan. Major deposits of coltan are found in DR Congo (Wikipedia,
    2021) where open cast mines blight the landscape. In addition, hundreds of small
    scale independent miners look for their own spoils. The impact on the environment
    is considerable, and this includes the local wildlife that used to live in the
    area, notably the Eastern Mountain Gorilla. Militias are often employed to protect
    the mines and their all-too valuable minerals, but these militias may abuse the
    local people, wildlife and more (YouTube, 2017). At a more visible level, the
    devices that we use require huge amounts of electricity, whether for the extraction
    and refinement process, the manufacturing process or the simple use of the end
    products. Where does the electricity come from? Well, that depends on where you
    live. You might be fortunate enough to live in a country that depends to a large
    extent on renewable energy resources (or at least gives you the option to source
    your electricity from such sources) – solar, hydro, wind, geothermal or wave for
    instance. But you might also live, as billions of people do, in a country that
    relies on coal or oil for energy production. Thus, to operate your devices, you
    are directly contributing to the coal economy and to further global warming via
    the CO2 that is emitted when coal is burned. How can the negative effect be reduced?
    The answer is simple but painful: we need to keep our existing devices in use
    for much longer than we currently do. We need to avoid the temptation to update
    our devices as soon as the next version is available. Here devices include: phones,
    tablets, notebooks, cameras, electric cars and any other device with significant
    battery use. We can’t eliminate the negative effects but we can reduce them. 3.1.1.2.
    Research agenda I think that a valid research agenda has to include the concept
    of sustainability. Tan B. (2021) are currently editing a special issue of the
    ISJ on IS and Sustainable Development. They note that the 2015 UN Agenda for Sustainable
    Development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated
    targets to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations Department of Economic & Social
    Affairs, 2015). These goals and targets constitute a research agenda in their
    own right, though not all are immediately applicable to IM/IS/IT. Meanwhile, Walsham
    (2012) argues that there is a need to undertake IS research that demonstrates
    how we can make the world a better place. To provide some other context, however,
    Clarke and Davison (2020) noted that almost no IS research, at least as published
    in the Association for Information Systems’ basket of eight journals (EJIS, ISJ,
    ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, MISQ), included the environment as a key stakeholder
    or treated the environmental perspective as a matter of importance. Thus, the
    track record in IS is not particularly rosy. We have a long way to go. 3.1.1.3.
    Education I teach Green IS issues to my MBA students: we identify and discuss
    issues concerning how green IS really is, including many of the issues raised
    in this editorial. We look at the topic from a policy perspective and consider
    what actions organizations can take to ensure that they genuinely adopt a green
    culture and implement green measures. This is particularly relevant to corporate
    social responsibility and the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997). 3.1.2. Contribution
    2 – digital platforms in combating climate change: user engagement tools and digital
    traces of climate footprints – Professor Ioanna Constantiou and Professor Morten
    Thanning Vendelø In spite of the increasing awareness about the consequences of
    climate change, many individuals continue to fail in adjusting their behaviors
    and lifestyles in order to lessen their impact on the climate. While mottos like
    “think globally, act locally” urges people to consider the health of the entire
    planet and to take action in their own communities and cities, they do not seem
    to significantly contribute to combating climate change. Many individuals appear
    to experience difficulties in understanding how their behavioral patterns and
    choices affect the climate of the planet, although the most recent UN Climate
    Report shows that with no changes in greenhouse gas emissions the increase in
    the global temperatures will rise to 2.7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
    (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). Hence, alternative means of influencing
    consumer behavior are required. Digital technologies can support individuals in
    developing connections between their behavioral patterns, and the ongoing changes
    in the global climate as well as identify and choose alternatives to these behavioral
    patterns (Schroder, Prockl, & Constantiou, 2021). Digital platforms can support
    combating climate change by providing marketplaces where transactions can be made
    in more cost efficient and climate friendly ways, promote sustainable product
    innovation or inform consumers about their climate footprints. The abundance of
    data available to digital platforms can be used for activities that promote sustainable
    options and motivating climate friendly behaviors. For example, applications tracking
    user physical activity can quantify climate impacts and thereby nudge users to
    consider more sustainable options of public transportation (e.g., based on CO2
    emissions of different means of transportation). Another area of interest is reduction
    of food waste. A number of digital platforms have recently emerged with related
    visions. Building on the logic of collaborative consumption and social entrepreneurship
    (Schroder et al., 2021), digital platforms such as Eat Grim provide a marketplace
    for selling vegetables and fruits that do not match industry standards based on
    appearance to consumers. Their aim is to change the consumers’ perceptions of
    appearance related quality standards of what is edible and nudge their users to
    eat vegetables and fruits by focusing on other criteria such as freshness, or
    nutrition value of the vegetables and fruits. By redistributing these products
    to their consumers from restaurants or other retail shops, they reduce food waste.
    Another example is the digital platform Too Good To Go that connects customers
    to restaurants and stores, mainly bakeries, that have unsold food surplus. The
    surplus food is sold to consumers at discounted prices instead of being wasted.
    Finally, Plant Jammer is another platform that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    and fight climate change through sustainable cooking and plant-based food. Consumers
    reduce waste in their home by using ingredients that would normally be wasted
    due to lack of knowledge on how to combine through recipes in their daily meals.
    These platforms provide multi sided marketplaces (Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary,
    2016) governed by loose control mechanisms and apply pricing structures for cost
    compensation, hence display low intensity of competition (Constantiou, Marton,
    & Tuunainen, 2017). Based on the data they collect they can develop new mechanisms
    to engage users. Customer engagement, is a multidimensional tool, rooted in marketing
    and social psychology, and described as “the level of an individual customer’s
    motivational, brand-related and context-dependent state of mind characterized
    by specific levels of cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity in direct brand
    interactions’’ (Hollebeek, 2011, p. 790). These dimensions cover three key activities
    that can support consumer transition to more climate friendly behaviors. Techniques
    displaying a quantified climate footprint based on the individual behaviors that
    are tracked by platforms, could stimulate cognitive activities towards combating
    climate changes, for example considering the impact of specific food choices,
    e.g., daily consumption of meat. This can lead to behavioral changes when multisided
    platforms make more environmentally friendly options easily accessible and economically
    attractive as observed with platforms combating food waste. Finally, gamification
    or other nudging techniques that stimulate emotions, either positive or negative,
    can reinforce consumer engagement with different platforms combating climate changes.
    The success of such mechanisms is reliant on increasing levels of user engagement
    with the platform where user behaviors can eventually be replaced with more climate
    friendly ones. 3.1.3. Contribution 3 – faith and climate change – Dr. Iyad Abumoghli
    While the world''s religious and spiritual traditions did not traditionally face
    climate change in the way society has come to know it since the mid-20th century,
    peoples throughout history have always lived through and had to deal with extreme
    and erratic weather events. Comparable notions of climate change have been expressed
    in the world’s different religions through their texts and teachings. There is
    no singular perspective or monolithic view of climate change within highly diverse
    faith and religious traditions. Within the same religion, adherents may hold different
    views and perspectives on climate change and humanity''s relationship with nature.
    However, there are general perspectives developed in consultation with adherents
    of represented faith groups. Naturally, they are taken from those who accept the
    scientific consensus on climate change. The Buddhist perspective on climate change,
    for example, is presented as the ecological consequences of our own collective
    karma. Therefore, it is not just an ecological crisis, but a spiritual one too.
    Within the broad sphere of Christianity, Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si,
    provides a high-level perspective on Catholicism’s views on climate change. He
    argues that climate change is a global problem and that humanity has a moral obligation
    to address it at all levels of society (UN News, 2015). Climate change can be
    explained through the Daoist concepts of Ying and Yang. The carbon balance between
    the earth and sky is off balance causing instability and disasters. Thus, climate
    change can be viewed as a manifestation of humanity’s failure to maintain harmony
    with nature. The Hindu Declaration on Climate Change states that “today we call
    on all Hindus to expand our conception of dharma (duty). We must consider the
    effects of our actions not just on ourselves and those humans around us, but also
    on all beings. Addressing climate change from an Islamic perspective, is about
    assuming the role as trustee or steward (khalifa) of creation that God bestowed
    upon humanity. This trusteeship applies to all life forms and ecosystems, in their
    full diversity and richness, reflecting the glory of their creator. Today, the
    balance (mizan) of nature has been disturbed by human activity and choices which
    have resulted in overconsumption, overexploitation and overuse of resources, ultimately
    leading to environmental degradation and climate change. Climate change is already
    manifesting itself in highly localized contexts, directly impacting Indigenous
    ways of life. Therefore, climate change does not just represent an abstract scientific
    issue, but rather a very real and dangerous threat to livelihoods and culture.
    Adherents from all the world’s religions and faith traditions agree that climate
    change represents an immense threat that must be overcome, for the sake of humanity,
    the environment and all living beings we share Earth with. This common understanding
    has led to an increase in faith, intrafaith and interfaith efforts to address
    it. These serve as an acknowledgment of the overwhelming scientific evidence that
    climate change is indeed human-induced. Faith actors can play a crucial role here
    given that faith permeates into all areas of life and can inspire the behavioral
    changes necessary to address climate change. As a testament to growing faith engagement,
    in the lead-up to COP21, held in Paris at the end of 2015, many Faith leaders
    and organizations called on governments to take climate change seriously and commit
    to addressing it. This formed part of a much broader global advocacy movement
    that helped lead to the creation of the Paris Agreement and the climate measures
    contained within it. In October 2021, in the lead up to COP26, more than 40 faith
    leaders met at the Vatican and submitted a Faith Appeal to the president of COP26
    linking Faith to Science and calling upon nations to increase their ambitions
    and committing their organizations to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
    This process has been only effective in engaging faith leaders over a period of
    seven months through information technology systems and online capabilities of
    applications. UNEP’s Faith for Earth Initiative was founded to accelerate and
    solidify precisely this spirit of interfaith collaboration, ensuring that faith
    actors had a voice at the highest level of environmental governance and greater
    access to the UN system. The interfaith initiative introduces the cultural, spiritual
    and ethical dimensions of sustainable development that faith actors bring into
    the implementation of the SDGs, particularly those related to the environment.
    Since its founding Faith for Earth has hosted and participated in multiple interreligious
    conferences, workshops, webinars and events, encouraging faith actors to come
    together and tackle common issues of climate change and environmental degradation.
    Faith actors can play an important role by providing a moral voice to the climate
    change crisis. Combining spiritual ethics with climate knowledge and science can
    serve to drive behavioral change amongst adherents, more than either one can alone.
    Substantial and widespread changes in public attitudes are essential to tackle
    climate change. Given that faith permeates into all areas of life, authoritative
    faith voices can be strong drivers in motivating people for action. Indeed, given
    that many religions already advocate environmentally friendly behaviors as part
    of their core values such as living with fewer material luxuries, caring for creation
    or dietary restrictions, there are strong traditions to draw upon. Faith groups
    across the globe are bringing religious teachings into thousands of projects on
    the ground to protect people and nature from the effects of climate change and
    pollution. By leading by example, FBOs can inspire positive action in communities
    to begin the transformation to a carbon-neutral sustainable society from the bottom
    up. Faith-based organizations have been using information technology to communicate
    with the world and pass their messages online, either directed to their congregations
    or to others through mainly social media and networks. Sharing publications, articles
    and courses has become easier for the faith communities. Climate change campaigns
    are among the most active ones among the faith communities. 3.1.4. Contribution
    4 – the pros and cons of IM/IT/IS on climate change and future directions – Professor
    Bhimaraya Metri 3.1.4.1. How the IM/IT/IS sector is having a negative impact on
    the environment and how it can be reduced The IS/ICT sector is a net source of
    global greenhouse gas emissions. The data centers used to power digital services
    now contribute approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – on par with the aviation
    sector (UNFCCC, 2016). The digital technology industry is one of the least sustainable
    and most environmentally damaging industrial sectors in the modern world (Junior,
    Majid, & Romli, 2018). If we are aiming to utilize technology as a mitigating
    factor for climate change we need to reform the way technology is used at different
    sectors, causing substantial damages: 3.1.4.2. Replacement rather than repair
    A consistent shift in the consumption pattern which pushes replace over repair
    is causing huge overheads on the environment. Companies like Apple are systematically
    discouraging self-repairs or repair at affordable prices thus pushing for replacement.
    3.1.4.3. Software upgrades pushing hardware replacements Innovation and upgradation
    in the technologies sector are simultaneously pushing the hardware upgrades. These
    upgrades often leave the legacy hardware unusable leading to e-waste. 3.1.4.4.
    E-waste Increasing digitalization is giving rise to the problem of e-waste. Much
    e-waste contains concentrated amounts of potentially harmful products, and this
    shows little sign of abating. In the absence of clear policy on e-waste flow management
    (Frazzoli, Orisakwe, Dragone, & Mantovani, 2010), the world produces about 50
    million tonnes of e-waste, with only 20% of it being dealt with sustainably (UN
    report, 2019, WEF report, 2019). 3.1.4.5. Technology driving electricity demand
    The overall demand for electricity from the digital technology sector is growing
    rapidly (Jones, 2018). It is further predicted that ICT networks could use about
    20% of the world’s electricity by 2025. The World Economic Forum (WEF, 2021) report
    stated, “by 2020, Bitcoin mining could be consuming the same amount of electricity
    every year as is currently used by the entire world”. Currently at the start of
    2020, Bitcoin alone has a carbon footprint of 34.73 Mt CO2 (equivalent to the
    carbon footprint of Denmark), it consumes 73.12 TWh of electrical energy (comparable
    to the power consumption of Austria), and it produces 10.95 kt of e-waste (equivalent
    to that of Luxembourg). Future projections relating to Smart Cities, 5 G and the
    Internet of Things give rise to additional concerns over energy demand Carroll
    and Heiser (2010). The negative outcomes of IT on the environment are further
    going to be increased with the advent of these new technologies. Even proliferation
    of Satellite Constellations could be a challenge (David, 2017). 3.1.4.6. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change Recent reports have
    highlighted that IT/IS can lead to a more efficient and sustainable energy consumption
    using smart grids, smart housing and smart logistics. Statistics suggest a possible
    fifteen percent reduction in the emission of green-house gases- close to the annual
    emissions of China. There are many initiatives to reduce energy consumption and
    carbon emissions. Japan’s $32 million Green IT Project promotes highly energy
    efficient ICTs in three areas. It aims to reduce energy consumption of network
    components and data centers by more than 30%. And Japan is experimenting with
    organic light-emitting diodes to cut the power consumption of displays by 50%
    (GZR, 2020). Technology can also offer cost-effective market-driven solutions,
    using sensors, software and networks. Technologies can also help monitor and evaluate
    climatic conditions and change and may help mitigate natural disasters. We also
    need to have supported policies and regulations for green energy. Supporting demand
    for green technologies is only one step. Certain pacts undertaken by regulatory
    bodies such as the European commission and united nations, also pave the way to
    regularize sustainable technology development. One such pact is the European Green
    Digital Coalition between the European Commission and United Nations Environment
    Programme. We have to ensure that new technology development is cognisant of impending
    climate changes. One of the ways to enable technology development that conforms
    to environment and sustainability goals is for governments to penalize technology
    developers that fail to adhere to global warming constraints. Leaders in the IT
    sector need to ensure that new technology developments and innovations are guided
    by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN. Further, government
    and regulatory authorities may promote climate friendly IT innovations by prescribing
    the necessary guidelines and incentives for better e-waste management and lower
    energy demands. 3.1.4.7. A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS
    and climate change Climate-change mitigating technology is a wide research area
    where researchers are attempting to gain more insights into the technology portfolio
    which can be utilized to mitigate the climate changes such as carbon emission,
    energy consumption and e-waste (McLaren and Markusson, 2020, Wang et al., 2018).
    Some of the other relevant research areas are. • Reuse/ recycle and sustainable
    manufacturing • Closed supply chain and e-waste removal • Reducing waste and efficient
    consumption using technology • Monitoring of natural disasters using technology.
    • Zero power ICT solutions • e-waste management • Circular economy • Green IT
    • Energy Management for data centers and telecommunication networks • Leveraging
    data science and Artificial Intelligence for predicting climatic changes and natural
    disasters 3.1.4.8. How IS/IT education should reflect this There is a need for
    including the impact of IT/IS on climate change in the curriculum across all disciplines
    (Perkins et al., 2018). There is a severe lack of awareness around the topics
    of climate change and how it connects to digitalization and technology transformations.
    There is a very swift adoption of new courses such as industry 4.0, blockchain
    technologies and IoT across premier educational institutions. However, courses
    discussing the flip side of these technologies in the context of climate change
    and sustainability are scarce. In addition to this, courses that introduce climate
    change mitigation technologies can be a good addition to start a conversation
    around climate change issues. 3.1.5. Contribution 5 – the role of online communities
    in supporting digital activism on climate change – Professor Niki Panteli COP26
    gives us the opportunity to reflect on our role as IS researchers on how IS/IT
    can support climate change. I draw on my personal interest and knowledge of online
    communities and digital platforms, to posit that IS has an enabling and empowering
    role in the promotion of climate change. My position in this editorial was triggered
    by an article in which the Swedish teenager and activist Greta Thunberg wrote
    in the Guardian (Thunberg, 2021), where she criticized world leaders for being
    in denial over the climate crisis. Indeed, there seems to be a catastrophic myopia
    among world leaders on current and emerging environmental threats and the challenges
    that climate change is causing to our planet. Instead of government and officials
    leading these debates, transparency of the challenges that humanity faces has
    been achieved by school children, teenagers and young adults around the world.
    The role of IS has been invaluable in providing a platform for these young activists
    to be heard, to form a community, to grow a collective voice and ultimately to
    lead on debates and protests and increase awareness on the climate crisis. A notable
    example of an IS-enabled climate change movement is the “School Strike 4 Climate”
    which was initiated and led by Greta Thunberg. Boulianne, Lalancette, and Ilkiw
    (2020) studied one of the school strikes in 2019 which was linked to this specific
    social movement and found that the online media in particular Twitter were used
    to share diverse sets of information such as local events, tactics for protesting,
    and opinions of climate change and blame of governments and other institutions
    for inaction and compliance on issues related to climate change. According to
    the same study, online platforms are transforming political engagement whilst
    offering the younger generation the means to express their ideas and voice their
    concerns to a global audience. Activism has been portrayed as a collective action
    (Landzelius, 2006), which can be orientated towards challenging the status-quo,
    and putting pressures on world leaders, corporations, communities, groups and
    individuals to make much needed changes. Digital activism can maintain activism
    traditional characteristics namely its collective nature and transformational
    purpose (George & Leidner, 2019), whilst its dynastic feature is that it relies
    on the use of online media and digital platforms with the purpose of reaching
    global audiences and mobilizing large-scale protests worldwide (Askanius & Uldam,
    2011). Online communities (OCs) offer the ground for breeding activism as they
    provide opportunities for individuals who regardless of their location voluntarily
    form a social aggregation through an online platform for sharing interests, knowledge
    and experiences (Rheingold, 1993). OCs can be used for providing a shelter for
    their members (Vaast & Levina, 2015) and a sense of place where members feel empowered
    to freely express themselves and get involved in stimulating discussions (Panteli,
    2016). The growth and sustainability of these communities depends on members’
    involvement. Mutual understanding among members (Ma & Agarwal, 2007) as well as
    group attachment and identification (Panteli and Sivunen, 2019, Ren et al., 2007)
    have been found to be crucial for OC success. In our research on digital activism,
    we studied the case of MedicineAfrica, an online health community (see Chamakiotis,
    Petrakaki, & Panteli, 2021), which had the aim to provide medical education and
    improve clinical practices in fragile, post-war countries. Findings showed that
    it is not so much the technological affordances of digital platforms—namely to
    inform, to network and to organize (Tim, Pan, Bahri, & Fauzi, 2018)—but it is
    primarily their potential to set up an online collective of like-minded individuals
    that allows this form of digital activism to succeed. Similarly, Cardoso, Boudreau,
    and Carvalho (2019) posited that though digital platforms can be used to organize
    collective action, the extent to which these are successful depends on the capacities
    and intents of their members, which the authors referred to in their study as
    resourcefulness and agency. It is not surprising therefore that IS researchers
    have shown an interest in OC members’ behaviors and practices, and how OC users
    interact with and influence each other within this online setting. Founded by
    passionate and enthusiastic individuals, OCs can be used to develop networks of
    support as a way for responding to emergencies (e.g. Nan & Lu, 2014); indeed climate
    change is not just a phenomenon that deserves to be understood, but an emergency
    that requires immediate action. With an understanding that OC knowledge flows
    travel beyond the community itself (Mozaffar & Panteli, 2021), there is a need
    to explore the direction and distance of the knowledge flows generated within
    OCs on climate change, and the impact that these are making on individuals, groups,
    organizations and governments worldwide. Further, digital climate activism offers
    the opportunity to study cross-generational differences on the use of online platforms
    and within OCs. Cross-generational differences have been evident in the use of
    social media platforms (Panteli & Marder, 2017) and a study on these differences
    is particularly relevant and topical with the increasing number of young digital
    activists globally. Research therefore on the interactions within OCs founded
    and led by teenagers and young adults should fall part of the agenda for future
    IS research. This should shed further light on who is indeed leading the climate
    crisis!. 3.2. Education, awareness and changed working practices 3.2.1. Contribution
    6 – Climate change and the emergent role of IS: an agenda for IS against the background
    of COP261 – Dr Rohit Nishant and Dr Thompson S.H. Teo Climate change is an existential
    threat facing humanity today.2 The recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought
    an important realization that humanity needs to be prepared for impending challenges
    such as climate change. Leaders from different countries assembled at the 2021
    United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, between October
    31, 2021- November 12, 2021. Political leaders as well as business leaders are
    expected to commit to ambitious goals and targets relating to emissions reduction.
    This COP26 comes after the recent working group report titled “Climate Change
    2021: The Physical Science Basis” as a part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
    of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
    report has been described as the starkest warning of irreversible and inevitable
    climate change (Harvey, 2021). The report is a call to humanity to come together
    and face this challenge, and academia also needs to focus on climate change. The
    role of IS has become more pronounced due to the increasing digitalization of
    our society, accelerated by COVID-19 pandemic. Exponential technologies such as
    AI and ML have the potential to combat climate change (George et al., 2021). However,
    the success of any technology is dependent on the people and processes surrounding
    the technology. IS, being at the intersection of people, process, and technology,
    is therefore well poised to play a key role in combating climate change. IS research
    has been focusing on socially relevant issues as well as examining green IS (Nishant
    et al., 2017, Watson et al., 2010). These researches have highlighted both the
    positive and negative aspects associated with IS. Nevertheless, recent conversations
    surrounding climate change offer new opportunities and avenues to IS research
    to contribute to this fight against climate change. These conversations and development
    surrounding COP26 are on specific goals and targets, economic models and recognition
    of specific areas as critical in our fight against climate change. Companies and
    different nations are increasingly talking about “Net Zero” where the addition
    of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the environment is nullified by equivalent reduction
    of GHGs from the environment. Companies such as Microsoft are showing their commitment
    to net zero by paying for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However,
    net zero also faces several challenges including measurement (Joppa et al., 2021)
    as net zero requires precise, consistent, and automated measurement. IS research
    can contribute to this endeavor by focusing on how IT used for automated measurement
    can help companies achieve the goal of net zero. It can focus on processes that
    increase the effectiveness of IT as well as the design of IS that facilitates
    automated measurement. Another related development is the Science Based Targets
    initiative (SBTi), which helps companies to set emissions reduction targets in
    line with scientific assessment in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement
    (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level and focus
    on efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degree Celsius).2 Over 1000 companies are working
    with SBTi.3 IS research can focus on understanding the role that the intersection
    of people, processes and IT is playing in SBTi. It can also focus on developing
    an understanding of conditions under which IT is effective in helping companies
    implement SBTi as well as challenges in leveraging IT. Another development is
    the increasing focus on the circular economy as a new economic model. The inherent
    objective is to minimize waste as much as possible relative to a linear economy,
    where products ultimately end up as waste. IS research has started to focus on
    the circular economy, but the focus has been primarily on the potential of IS
    to facilitate circular material flows (Zeiss, Ixmeier, Recker, & Kranz, 2021).
    As data increasingly flows through the digital economy, data flow has its own
    carbon footprint and the proliferation of data can lead to redundant data. IS
    research can focus on how the idea of circular economy affects data generation
    and data flow, and how IS research can help minimize the carbon footprint of IS
    artifacts. Data also forms an essential component of AI/ML. As our society increasingly
    uses AI/ML and other exponential technologies, their own carbon footprint cannot
    be ignored. IS research can help companies and societies to redesign processes
    such that these technologies can be used effectively without damaging the environment.
    In terms of recognition of specific areas as important in the fight against climate
    change, there is also an increasing emphasis on biodiversity. In fact, the COVID-19
    pandemic has brought out an important realization that deforestation and loss
    of biodiversity can trigger new pandemics (Tollefson, 2020). Climate change can
    also facilitate zoonotic spillover (Rodó, San-José, Kirchgatter, & López, 2021).
    IS research has generally not focused on issues relating to biodiversity. Nevertheless,
    projects such as Half-Earth Project Map, that maps biodiversity exemplifies how
    IT can play a key role in conserving biodiversity. IS research can focus on the
    design of IS artifacts that support biodiversity. It can also focus on IS use
    for biodiversity conservation by companies, government, and different agencies
    and explore the factors that contribute to the success of such initiatives. Besides
    research, the IS community can contribute by making students aware of issues relating
    to climate change. Other disciplines such as management are increasingly focusing
    on climate change related issues.4 The IS community has contributed to increasing
    awareness of issues related to climate change through courses on green IS and
    IS for sustainability. The current debates surrounding climate change provide
    an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment. Students are increasingly interested
    in courses on data analytics, AI, and ML. We can make students aware that data,
    AI, and ML also have a carbon footprint, and thus they should be used in an optimal
    manner such that their carbon footprint does not diminish the benefits realized
    from them. In summary, we see that IS research and teaching can make a strong
    contribution to our fight against climate change through a focus on issues that
    have become topical due to COP26 and increasing digitalization of society. 3.2.2.
    Contribution 7 – dematerialization is so material! The contrasting impacts of
    IT on the environment and climate change – Professor Yves Barlette 3.2.2.1. How
    the IM/IT/IS sector contributes to a negative impact on the environment and how
    it can be reduced IT and IS correspond to dematerialization, but only to some
    extent. If we create digital copies of documents and save paper (and trees), we
    still have to store the data we create. Moreover, data which was stored on our
    devices (smartphones and computers) or on DVD/Blu-Rays, USB sticks (e.g., movies
    and music) or just broadcasted (radios and TV), are now increasingly decentralized
    ‘in the cloud’, i.e., data centers. Data exchanges also involve emails, texts,
    and all that we exchange using social media. Even if emails seem “old-fashioned”
    today, some companies can send the same message including 10 MB of attached files
    to 1500 employees, generating 15,000 MB, which will never be deleted for most
    of us. If these are ‘dematerialized’ and almost ‘virtual’ documents, they require
    storage, and instead of removing old data, the size of our mailboxes keeps on
    increasing and is measured today in GB. Hence, streaming and data exchanges have
    become the norm. Instead of waiting for broadcasting by TV channels and watching
    a movie, or by radio listening to a song, each of us can separately obtain the
    content on-demand and stream the same song over and over. The Korean series “Squid
    Game” from Netflix generated such a huge demand, that SK broadband sued Netflix
    over the resulting surge in network traffic (Campbell, 2021). The rollout of 5
    G will multiply by 100 the traffic capacity offered by 4 G and will in turn increase
    the volumes of exchanged data. Although the climate impact of streaming and data
    exchanges may have been overrated, they nevertheless remain significant (Kamiya,
    2020). To solve these problems, education seems to be the main solution, however,
    a tax related to bandwidth consumption could be created for streaming and cloud-based
    companies. This would in turn increase cost for users. Options such as a tax for
    other kinds of companies or even a tax on the users themselves could be created,
    specific to bandwidth consumption and/or storage volume. Storage rationalization,
    also known as “Green storage”, is also a possibility. Google is able to show its
    users their carbon footprint within the cloud (Lardinois, 2021). However, these
    data exchanges and distant storage of data require data centers and data transmission
    networks: First, company IT infrastructures, data centers and data transmission
    networks, including computers and storage, that must be manufactured. The manufacturing
    of computers requires a large amount of fossil fuels, chemicals, and raw materials.
    The mining of raw materials for electronic products includes copper, lead, and
    gold and contributes to increased environmental problems. For example, gold mines
    are the leading source of mercury air pollution in the U.S. (Gerson, Wadle, &
    Parham, 2020). Mining also pollutes the water of surrounding communities. When
    the various devices are discarded, they are sent to landfills overseas in Africa,
    China, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. Computers contain heavy metals like
    lead and toxic chemicals that pollute the soil and contaminate groundwater when
    they are dumped into landfill. Some solutions to mitigate these issues include
    (1) increasing recycling, (2) stopping greenwashing that includes cessation of
    waste recycling to countries that cannot actually recycle and (3) mitigate planned
    obsolescence and increase the reparability of devices. Second, IT devices, data
    centers and data transmission networks need power to operate thereby generating
    significant levels of heat. Several possibilities have been tested, for example
    underwater data centers and data centers located in northern countries. This does
    not reduce the heat generated but at least reduces the required energy for cooling.
    Even if the problem related to heat is not addressed, the use of carbon-free but
    polluting energies such as nuclear, must also be solved. 3.2.2.2. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change I see several aspects:
    • IT/IS permits the use of more efficient products and designs that save raw materials
    and energy. For example, digital twins can help to better design improved products,
    e.g., car batteries (Merkle, Pöthig, & Schmid, 2021). • Processes can be more
    efficient and supply chains can be improved, reducing energy used during manufacturing,
    reducing fuel requirements and food waste during transportation. • Big data analytics
    offer possibilities for precision agriculture, reducing water waste, use of fertilizers,
    pesticides and other pollutants. • Work-from-Home possibilities, reducing business
    trips, encouraging ‘virtual’ companies. • Super calculators allow us to improve
    weather models and offer insights on what factors are the most important to regulate
    climate change. • The solution to controlled thermonuclear fusion power, could
    solve the energetic component of IT/IS impact on climate change. Fusion is only
    possible when scientists are able to compute the shape of magnetic confinement
    devices of Tokamaks and Stellarators (Klinger, 2021) or to perform simulations.
    3.2.2.3. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change • Improving methodological
    innovations in greenhouse gas emissions calculations. • Improving weather models
    to mitigate climate change and risks related to this change. • Development of
    awareness campaigns dedicated to mitigating our personal and professional environmental
    impacts related to IT and IS. • Increasing the conception and use of new big data
    analytics tools to mitigate the impacts of our society on climate change. • Developing
    charters in companies including best practices (see below). • Developing tools
    for smart buildings (lighting, heating, ventilation) and energy management (statistics,
    diagnostics). 3.2.2.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this IS/IT education
    could act in several ways: • Disseminate knowledge and create awareness-raising
    campaigns about the negative impacts of IT/IS on environment and how they can
    be reduced by adopting best practices including for example: • Automatic sleep
    mode and turning of the devices during nights and weekends. • Workers and home
    users should know that ‘dematerialization’ and ‘virtualization’ does not exist
    and that data is always ‘materialized’ somewhere. • Future CIOs and members of
    IT staff should be offered during their education awareness-raising campaigns,
    including the same as above plus IT/IS-specific elements: for example, the fact
    of checking that all audiovisual devices are turned off every evening. The same
    for all the laser printers in a company, even if some monitoring is deactivated.
    Turning off the monitors of their computers, even if some systems must always
    run. 3.2.3. Contribution 8 – emerging technologies to mitigate supply chain disruption
    due to climate change – Professor Manoj Kumar Tiwari Climate change has become
    one of the most important concerns in recent years at nearly all tiers of decision-making.
    Climate change is a set of worldwide phenomena caused mostly by the burning of
    fossil fuels that release greenhouse or heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere
    such as methane, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, and nitrous
    oxide. These factors have resulted in changing global weather patterns, with frequent
    occurrence of hurricanes, droughts and rising temperatures causing habitats to
    vanish, and altering ecosystems. Climate change has a worldwide impact. As a result
    of such calamities, homelessness is on the rise, putting vulnerable communities
    at risk of food insecurity, disease, and civil upheaval. Climate change, as a
    result of global warming, is a universally acknowledged reality that affects human,
    industry, business, and the environment in a variety of ways. Supply chain and
    Logistics providers among all the industries being aware of the consequences of
    climate change are most conscious about the deterioration happening due to variation
    in weather patterns, storms, altered sea routes, and environmental changes will
    all have a significant impact on their operations, forcing them to alter conventional
    business models and trading routes. If logistics companies are on the front lines
    of climate change, they are also huge contributors to the crisis. Transportation
    industry accounts for nearly 25% of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion around
    the world (IEA, 2019). While value addition to the product as it passes through
    the supply chain, each SC link causes environmental deterioration, especially
    climatic pollution, via GHG emission. In return, each channel in the supply chain
    faces opportunities and risks in the form of severe occurrences such as waterlogging
    or windstorms, higher temperature, soil erosion, rising sea levels, storms, impact
    on local weather conditions, increased storm frequency and intensity, drought,
    and so on. As a consequence, both climate change and supply chain activities are
    simultaneously impacted. Mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation (preparedness
    for inescapable circumstances) are two aspects of dealing with climate change.
    Both of these challenges are multidimensional. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    changes are required in power grids, buildings, transportation, land use and industry.
    Given a better knowledge of climate and catastrophic occurrences, adaptation necessitates
    disaster management and resiliency. Presently, Machine learning (ML) has gained
    popularity as a versatile tool for technological advancement. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and ML techniques can contribute to reduce emissions in several ways such
    as by speeding up the development of low-carbon technologies, better demand predictions,
    reducing system waste, remote sensing, improving energy efficiency, vehicle emission
    estimation from smartphone GPS traces, single building optimization, identifying
    behavioral patterns, and planning and operating low-carbon infrastructure. The
    impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is becoming more essential
    as people become more aware of climate change and its obvious implications. It
    provides simple and faster problem resolution using simulations and a large variety
    of different options. Climate change concerns can be monitored, mitigated, and
    adapted with the use of ICTs. Some inventions of ICTs are Wireless Sensor Networks,
    Satellite Technology, GIS, Remote Sensing, Mobile Technology, and Web-based applications.
    Climate change mitigation and adaptation can be more efficient and successful
    with the use of ICTs, if integrated strategically; it contains knowledge centers,
    mobile phones, and interactive media. By educating and raising awareness at the
    community level, sharing theoretical and practical knowledge, and empowering people
    to have access to knowledge and relevant data, it can assist vulnerable populations
    in reducing the risk of climate change. Micro-sensor Wireless Network is among
    the most prominent technologies in the twenty-first century, with a wide range
    of applications. Commercial or human-centric applications, robotics, military
    applications, and environmental monitoring are all using the applications of wireless
    sensor networks. Sustainable Environmental Management Information System (IS)
    can maintain the decision-making process for supportable climate control and develops
    Earth-friendly design. Emergence of big data and AI/ML techniques allows climate
    solution research to design policy and its implementation at the building and
    household scale, street, urban areas, modified to specific circumstances but scalable
    to worldwide mitigation possibilities. Furthermore, the wide application of ICTs
    also adds to the depletion of limited energy supplies and the increase in greenhouse
    gas emissions. It is one of the causes contributing to rising CO2 levels for producing
    ICT machinery and devices, energy usage, and electronic waste recycling. We are
    living in a phase of rapid transformation, where technological advancements are
    transforming the way of our living, at the same time directing us to face several
    challenges in the form of climate change and resource scarcity. Although these
    technologies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions to some extent, they aid in
    the reduction of considerably larger amounts released by all other industries.
    By establishing smarter cities, industrial processes, electrical grids, transportation
    systems, and energy savings benefits, ICT can cut CO2 emissions on a worldwide
    scale. ICT may be used to investigate and manage natural resources in a variety
    of ways, both locally and worldwide. As a result, information and communication
    technologies constitute a critical component in combating climate change and mitigating
    its effects. Some ICT tools used to mitigate climate change are: • Computer-controlled
    devices are used in a variety of ways to reduce energy consumption in the home,
    at work, and in manufacturing; • Telecommunications are critical in response to
    natural calamities caused by climate change; • Sensor networks can be used to
    monitor vulnerable or dangerous environments. • Satellite observations give critical
    information on climate and vegetation trends. Oceans and land can be monitored
    by sensors either on the ground or remotely through satellite. The state of the
    atmosphere can be examined for wind currents and greenhouse gas emissions that
    may indicate the impending arrival of a storm. Data on tsunamis and sea-level
    changes can be communicated via satellite via ocean buoys. • Geographic information
    systems can understand and visualize data. • Better study and modeling of complex
    environmental and climate systems are possible due to increased computing capability
    and innovative techniques. • Distributed (grid) computing helps scholars to dig
    deeper into themes. Natural catastrophes affect around 200 million people each
    year, according to United Nations figures. ICT plays a critical role in providing
    early warnings for natural disasters. It provides essential data on the effects
    of climate change that might lead to disasters, in addition to the usage of sensor
    networks to monitor hazards such as active volcanoes. Among these include increasing
    sea levels, depleting freshwater resources, deforestation, and ecosystem concerns.
    The Famine Early Warning System Network is one example of how ICT may help. Its
    goal is to reduce the possibility of food shortages by alerting people to early
    warning signals of famine. The system monitors and analyses data about climate
    and weather, as well as their impact on crops, utilizing information technology.
    The data is subsequently delivered to decision-makers in the form of monthly food
    security updates, predictions, and alarms, as well as assistance with emergency
    preparedness and long-term policy decisions. A variety of sensor systems created
    for weather monitoring (ocean buoys) and earthquake detection are used in tsunami
    warning systems (seismic sensors). Data is collected and delivered into real-time
    analysis and detection systems via satellite. Grid computing makes it possible
    to share data in order to do in-depth analysis. The Global Earth Observation System
    is available for all policymakers to get access to the data. There are free programs
    that allow us to zoom in on satellite photos that map the world. Geographic information
    systems (GIS) are one of the most powerful — and extensively used — tools for
    visualizing environmental data. Overall, using technology into climate change
    assessment, prevention, and adaptation can help save the ecosystem from damage
    and degradation. 3.2.4. Contribution 9 – facing the negative environmental digital
    impact: time to change values? Professor Frantz Rowe To examine whether and how
    the IT sector can have a negative impact on the environment, following the evolution
    of our awareness of the issues, I will address first the aspect of the question
    which concerns how the use of IT products is affecting the environment, before
    turning to the issue of IT production itself. The world has drastically changed
    since the end of the last century. In the 1980s, the first oil crisis was just
    behind. Society, including researchers with my transportation engineering and
    my economics background, saw enormous benefits in telecommunications to reduce
    transportation negative impacts on the environment such as pollution and CO2 emissions.
    Our first studies on the use of the telephone in households, that had been adopted
    lately in France in the 1970s, demonstrated some substitution effects on urban
    trips. However, the main lesson was that, at the scale of a large city, a) the
    net substitution effect was low since the telephone also induced some trips, and
    b) the main effect of telephone-transportation interactions was an accompanying
    or “management” effect (Claisse & Rowe, 1993). Unless we take and accept restrictive
    measures on our liberties to move, like the recent lockdowns, the effects of new
    communication tools such as video conferencing meetings, will not reduce transportation
    demand. This is notably due to an induction effect linked to the opportunities
    and more largely to a “digital rebound” effect (Coroama & Mattern, 2019), whether
    for business or social life, generated by interactions with communication technology.
    Hence my spontaneous answer to the question - how can (the) IT (sector) have a
    negative impact on the environment? - is that, unless we voluntarily reduce our
    activity and do less, the only significant gains from IT use will occur if we
    can reduce the negative impacts related to the efficiency of transportation systems.
    This means that we should design transportation systems so that their use is more
    environmentally efficient, i.e. they pollute less than others when used and have
    the best possible environmental footprint (for instance in terms of CO2 emissions)
    when produced (Teubler, Kiefer, & Liedtke, 2018). Typically IS researchers can
    contribute to such “green” designs for “greener” use by examining how IT/IS can
    help support the use of such transportation systems and more generally support
    more environmentally efficient supply chains. We looked at this, studying how
    Carrefour had redesigned its supply chain, but gains were not spectacular (Antheaume
    et al., 2018, de Corbière et al., 2016). This revision of the supply chain is
    what we would call a " second order " revision. It involved using IT based solutions
    to improve the use of trucks and supply chain restructuring with an additional
    layer of consolidation centers. It did not involve “first order” transportation
    modes improvements such as the use of trains, or river-boats which generate fewer
    GHG emissions per t.km but may be more expensive, at least to start with. This
    is because what corporations seek is to be more efficient economically, while
    ideally showing that they are environmentally conscious. However, in the large
    retailing industry for instance, becoming environmentally efficient is not their
    main concern. Unless they are forced to do so, they will not really optimize CO2
    emissions or other environmental indicators. A set of interviews on the impact
    of e-commerce on retailers supply chains shows that senior managers just want
    to be politically correct (de Corbière, Durand, & Rowe, 2010). However, we believe
    that the potential of information systems to reduce pollution is very large. Here
    again, we can distinguish between first order and second order changes. First
    order changes might be, for example: “combined truck-train transport, where for
    long distances trucks will travel on train carriages (as is done in Switzerland),
    or assisting with local manufacturing solutions, based on 3D printing, rather
    than subcontracting to a third party in another country. These first order changes
    also involve challenges which IT can help resolve. Second order changes might
    be, for example, to control cargo or to optimize vehicle routes regardless of
    the type of transportation mode considered. Regularly, containers are lost at
    sea and cargo and ships can be better controlled before their cargo falls overboard.
    Satellites, RFID technologies and web portals can be important to support these
    aims. There are many other avenues for improvements in that direction. But again,
    the issue is not just about what type of digital technology we should invest in
    to help traditional businesses reduce their environmental impact; what counts
    is to find appropriate production solutions and institutional mechanisms so that
    firms really aim at reducing harmful emissions in a significant manner and not
    always put profitability first. Like the retail or transportation industry, the
    problem is that the IT sector itself is engaged in a worldwide competition where
    profitability and convenience innovations for the consumer are key. Typical of
    these innovations the smartphone is only 14 years old, but its appearance also
    has very negative implications simply because it needs to be produced and incorporates
    rare materials that are extracted in terrible conditions in some African and Asian
    countries. In short, the ecological imprint of IT may be negative because IT products
    also have drastically changed: by becoming “smart”, and more precisely due to
    the introduction of manipulable screens, our telephones have also become very
    destructive of scant resource (Ritthof, Rohn, & Liedtke, 2002). In parallel the
    speed at which we renew corresponding infrastructures such as 5 G and soon 6 G
    won’t help. Our dream of the world being cleaned from pollution by an immaterial
    economy was just a very naïve dream. Many other examples abound such as servers
    farms for the cloud and other data centers that demonstrate huge environmental
    costs. Worse than that with the internet of things, machine to machine communication,
    automated vehicles and bots in finance may make environmental pollution uncontrollable
    or at least many times superior to that created with human-controlled processes.
    For instance, researchers recently demonstrated that training an artificial intelligence
    could explode CO2 emission costs (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). Not only
    are we exhausting resources, but there are huge geopolitical implications related
    to the sometimes unique locations of these resources on the planet and related
    to where chips or materials for certain of our digital equipment are produced
    (to the extent that children’s lives are destroyed as in Congo, see Lebrun, 2020).
    These geopolitical risks may in turn generate other ecological risks because we
    unfortunately know that wars are never clean. Unless we take and accept measures
    to get sober in what we consume and what we produce, digitization alone may not
    be such a good solution for saving our environment. This goal implies making value
    choices (Rowe, 2018) and requires rethinking the design of our activities at multiple
    levels in an interdisciplinary and systemic manner (Nishant et al., 2020). 3.2.5.
    Contribution 10 – from cradle to grave – impact of IT on climate change and the
    relevant research agenda – Professor Ramakrishnan Raman 3.2.5.1. How the IM/IT/IS
    sector is having a negative impact on the environment and how it can be reduced
    IT and its applications have made business processes efficient, but the rapid
    growth of technology and its applications has also negatively impacted the environment.
    Whilst green IT practices have advocated to minimize the negative impact of IT
    on the environment, there is still a huge scope for changes to be brought into
    manufacturing, logistics and operations, usage and disposal of information technology
    equipment, which can make every process sustainable and environmentally-friendly.
    Manufacturing of Information technology products can be environmentally-friendly
    if the production adopts environmentally friendly processes. Process innovation
    is needed which can help in creating products which use fewer natural resources
    and also reduce pollution. Recycling and reuse of material and zero emission should
    be the goal of every IT manufacturing process. IT manufacturing can become environmentally
    friendly by using energy from renewable sources and also by focusing on energy
    efficiency. Innovation in business processes that can help in achieving zero pollution,
    remove greenhouse gas emissions and also eliminate waste. Focus on conserving
    natural resources can help in making manufacturing of Information technology products
    environmentally-friendly. Logistics and supply chain processes used by the IT
    sector cause hazardous air emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Logistics and
    operations can be environmentally-friendly if manufacturers shift to green suppliers
    and partners who provide green logistics and supply chain processes and also handle
    reverse logistics. If organizations focus on consolidated shipments and reduce
    packaging by redesigning products, it can immensely help in reducing the negative
    impact on the environment. IT products have an impact on the environment even
    during the ‘use’ stage of their life cycle. The energy consumed by the product,
    the lifetime of the product, the heat dissipated and the digital frequency noise
    have a negative impact on the environment. Creating products that are more durable
    and reusable can help the environment. Less resource intensive gadgets which work
    with low power and solar power and IT gadgets will not only help protect the planet
    but also will help in the well-being of all. Responsible and environmentally friendly
    disposal of IT products can help the environment. In several developing nations
    the practise of disposing IT waste in landfills is the most popular disposal method,
    which has a colossal negative impact on the environment. Stringent regulations
    applicable for every end consumer, which mandates safe disposal of e-waste to
    certified e-waste recyclers can help in reducing the negative impact of IT disposal
    on the environment. 3.2.5.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized to improve situation
    regarding climate change Application of IT can immensely help in managing climate
    change. Use of IT while developing smart cities can help reduce annual global
    greenhouse gas emissions. For example, smart energy meters and smart electric
    systems help in managing climate change by optimal use of energy consumption.
    This in turn can also help in smart electric grid management which helps in reducing
    the losses. This is a simple example to showcase the use of smart IT systems which
    can help utility companies, end-users and society at large and also help also
    in managing climate change. Internet and Internet technologies are a force to
    reckon with for managing climate change. IT can infuse intelligence in transportation
    and logistics and make them smart. The Internet of Things (IoT) can make the supply
    chain smart and agile and hence can help in reducing the emission of greenhouse
    gases. Internet and Internet technologies can also help in monitoring the environment
    to reduce energy use in real time. IT can be used to harness and create green
    homes, green industries and hence can help in managing climate change. 3.2.5.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change Information
    Technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are vital in confronting climate change
    problems and help in managing the threats posed by climate change. IT and IoT
    are part of the solution as their applications are being used to cut greenhouse
    gas emissions and they help countries manage climate change. IT and IoT are needed
    for precipitous transfer of information concerning risks of climate change. In
    this context a few questions which need deeper research include - How can information
    needed for decision making be collected and disseminated in an efficient manner
    which can help to advance the integration of climate risks into plans and policies,
    which can be useful for those who need it most? How can a low-cost IoT infrastructure
    be created in the urban and rural areas of developing countries which can enable
    authentic and speedy dissemination of real time data related to greenhouse gas
    emissions? How can IT and IoT be used to enable countries to adapt to climate
    change? 3.2.5.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Education is vital in
    enabling people to understand the impact of climate change on life on this planet.
    Educating and creating awareness can help to change the attitude and behavior
    of people. Education alone can help in ensuring that people start adopting a sustainable
    lifestyle and also develop skills that can help in managing climate change. Education
    can not only inspire people to change their attitudes and behavior, but also helps
    them to make informed decisions which can have an impact on climate change. A
    deep-seated shift in pedagogy is needed for IT and IoT to enhance teaching and
    learning for sustainability. Teaching about climate change needs an interdisciplinary
    and cross disciplinary approach to synthesize diverse ideas. The information about
    climate change and its impact must be introduced within the school curriculum.
    IT must be used to create interactive activities on climate change which can help
    students to understand and learn in a better fashion. Projects related to sustainable
    development and climate change must be introduced at the high school level. IT
    tools which can help measure carbon emission must be taught along with practical
    application of the same. Teaching and learning which has hands-on experiences
    with technology must be emphasized. At the undergraduate and graduate level, educating
    and giving opportunities to students to work on environmentally sustainable projects
    to attain sustainability objectives using IT and IoT technologies can immensely
    help in bringing out of the box solutions to climate change problems. 3.2.6. Contribution
    11 – How has the IT sector negatively influenced the environment? Remedies, role
    of IT education and future research agenda – Professor Nripendra P. Rana 3.2.6.1.
    How information management (IM)/information technology (IT)/information systems
    (IS) sector have any negative impact on environment and how it can be reduced?
    The IT sector is constituted of companies that produce software, hardware or semiconductor
    equipment or the companies that provide Internet or related services (Miller,
    2021). Technological advancement has transformed the way we live our lives. Many
    would argue that the growth of the number of electronic devices such as laptops,
    desktops, high performance computing servers, and other most powerful data-intensive
    computing solutions (e.g., supercomputers) have brought us numerous benefits,
    there is no denying that the proper and continuous functioning of these technologies
    have come at a cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The heavy use of these
    devices present concerns when it comes to resource use, energy use, carbon footprint
    and waste. The negative impact of the IT sector on the environment could well
    be traced right from the manufacturing of these devices as a large proportion
    of materials come from finite natural resources and precious metals. Procuring
    raw materials and precious metals for manufacturing technological devices and
    electronic equipment comes with a high carbon cost usually powered by fossil fuels,
    deforestation, landscape degradation, water pollution and the release of vast
    quantities of carbon dioxide into the air (Mensah et al., 2015). For example,
    silicon, plastic, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, barium are
    some of the most important materials used for manufacturing the technological
    equipment for which the mining of these poses serious threats to our environment
    (Williams, 2010). Similarly, manufacturing of these equipment requires massive
    energy to convert them into complex and sophisticated technological products.
    Subsequently, the transportation of these finished products also comes with a
    high carbon cost. Finally, massive servers and data warehouses that enable these
    technologies to work also consume a vast amount of energy and this threat does
    not stop there. These products also pose setback at the end of their lifespan
    and globally we throw away electronic waste (e-waste) of approximately $62.5 billion
    every year and only one-fifth of the electronic waste generated globally is currently
    formerly recycled, which undoubtedly an enormous threat to the environment (Amos,
    2020, Okafor, 2020). It is therefore very evident that the entire lifecycle of
    technological evolution to disposition adversely affects the environment and technological
    companies are largely responsible for this threat. This negative impact of the
    IT sector on the environment could be reduced to a certain extent by adopting
    the responsible practices of the circular economy, which signifies reusing some
    of the raw materials of the disposed equipment for a more sustainable approach
    to consumption. The governments and local authorities also have the larger responsibilities
    by legislating the circular economy model, promoting eco-friendly manufacturing
    and by adopting a responsible way of sustainable consumption. This could be achieved
    by implementing effective laws and regulations on e-waste (Geissdoerfer, Savaget,
    Bocken, & Hultink, 2017). 3.2.6.2. How can IM/IT/IS be utilized to improve climate
    change? Technological developments – particularly the discovery of use of fossil
    fuels, have contributed to climate change. Rising temperatures are essentially
    blamed by scientists for human-generated gases (primarily CO2), concentrations
    of which have been enhanced by almost 50% since the industrial revolution started.
    Innovations such as carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies are being
    used to reduce CO2. During the time of the Coronavirus pandemic, many office jobs
    were being done from home resulting in reduced emissions of CO2 from transport
    and office buildings (Sky News, 2021). The technological innovations to support
    remote working has been swiftly embraced as businesses endeavored to manage the
    effect of Covid-19. Greater use of data centers and cloud computing services by
    some of the leading technology giants including Amazon, Google and Microsoft are
    also an example of energy efficient services. With many of the latest technology
    efficient products such as smart LED light bulbs, smart outlet and power adapters,
    smart thermostat, etc. responsible for reducing energy consumption available in
    the market not only help households to save decent amounts of money in their annual
    bills but also reduce the CO2 emissions (Oberhaus, 2019). 3.2.6.3. A brief discussion
    on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change? Although the technology
    improvement with an environmental attribute reduces overall CO2 has been discussed
    in the prior research, how the role of technology change in lowering carbon emission
    intensity needs to be further researched for the overall reduction of CO2 (Li
    & Wang, 2017). While the low-carbon energy technologies contribute toward mitigating
    climate change (Schmidt & Sewerin, 2017), there is a need for further research
    on how social-psychological factors, lifestyles, behavioral patterns, etc. will
    help organizations and individuals to adopt such technologies that can reduce
    the CO2 emission and serve toward the climate change. The future researchers could
    also look to explore the adoption of such technologies in different contexts for
    both well-aware and less aware consumers about using such technologies for the
    purpose of supporting climate change action. Future research can also explore
    individuals'' pro-environmental behavior toward using such technologies. 3.2.6.4.
    How IS/IT education should reflect this? Information technology education could
    be a key component of raising awareness of climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    One suggested solution could be the collaboration between the scientists and the
    students at the pre- and post-college levels to make them aware of how modern
    emerging technologies could help reduce hazardous emissions and reduce the threat
    of global warming. The pre-college school system is the right place to disseminate
    such scientific information on the key global climate change issues. School teachers
    should be provided with the necessary advanced level of educational and hands-on
    training from scientists from local research bodies on climate change and governments
    should take the necessary steps to make it a part of the curriculum. Climate change
    is not only the knowledge that should be taught to children right from an early
    age, but they should also be made aware of how to responsibly use technologies
    in a way that helps reduce carbon emissions becoming ambassadors for sustainable
    living. 3.2.7. Contribution 12 – technology, information systems and sustainability:
    a public interest research agenda – Professor Katina Michael and Dr Roba Abbas
    3.2.7.1. The negative impact of technology and information systems on the environment
    The coupling of natural and human systems is defined by highly integrated and
    complex system dynamics resulting from human-nature interactions (Liu et al.,
    2007). This has presented significant global challenges and wicked problems (Buchanan,
    1992, Brown et al., 2010) that require immediate attention in view of sustainability,
    particularly given the centrality of technology and information systems (IS) to
    these interactions. A multifaceted feature of the natural system that is integral
    to all forms of life is biodiversity, which can be considered at three levels:
    genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity (Chapin III et al.,
    2000). Biodiversity is both implicitly and explicitly linked to health and wellbeing,
    in addition to sustainable development programs (Naeem et al., 2016, World Health
    Organization and Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2015).
    Human actions, notably decisions concerning technology and information systems,
    increasingly impact biodiversity. In line with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference
    of the Parties (COP26) Sustainability Governing Principles, there is a pressing
    need to engage in deliberate management of potential environmental impacts to
    encourage inclusivity, health and sustainability (UN Climate Change Conference
    UK 2021). Adverse impacts on the natural world resulting from existing and emerging
    technologies and IS can be described as negative externalities (Dasgupta and Ehrlich,
    2013, Perrow, 1991). The field of environmental economics, among other things,
    involves the study of externalities that generate tangible and intangible costs
    to the physical environment and its inhabitants (Cropper & Oates, 1992). It is
    often difficult to quantify these costs given the reach of an incident, and the
    extent of its irreversible impact. For example, significant oil spills cause major
    externalities that cannot readily be measured, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil
    spill, which was estimated to have spilled 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into
    the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Beyer, Trannum, Bakke, Hodson, & Collier, 2016). There
    are two main types of negative externalities; the first refers to negative production
    externalities that can cause, for example, air or water pollution through manufacturing
    plants powered by technology and other forms of engineering; and the second denotes
    negative consumption externalities that can cause for instance, traffic congestion
    and noise pollution that are generated by systems (Biglan, 2009). Externalities
    caused by technologies and IS may be unanticipated, unintended, and even paradoxical
    (Pringle, Michael, & Michael, 2016). Unanticipated externalities refer to those
    incidents and system failures that were not factored into scenario planning and
    risk management processes during systems design and development, such as the Fukushima
    Daiichi nuclear disaster whereby a substantial wave surged over defences and flooded
    reactors causing major radiation leakage (von Hippel, 2011). Unintended consequences
    of technologies and IS are those that were discounted as potential outcomes of
    a respective system, but nonetheless transpired (Ash, Berg, & Coiera, 2004). An
    example is the use of irrigation systems for crops, which subsequently contributes
    to soil erosion and increased soil salinity (Khan, Tariq, Yuanlai, & Blackwell,
    2006). Conversely, paradoxical externalities emerge from attempts to use technologies
    and IS for advantage and benefit, but where the result is a negative outcome on
    another aspect of the environment. An example is the introduction of Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices to monitor energy systems to lower consumption that requires
    the devices to be powered and over time to be replaced, causing often toxic and
    non-biodegradable e-waste that is disposed of in landfills (Mukhopadhyay & Suryadevara,
    2014). A common element underpinning these types of negative externalities is
    the impact on public resources that are shared by communities (Pigou, 1920). These
    include the ocean and its fisheries and clean drinking water, amongst others,
    leaving individuals and communities vulnerable, potentially compromising their
    health and wellbeing. Furthermore, these undesirable impacts extend to the natural
    system and environment. These impacts can be linked to technologies and IS that
    do not suitably consider socio-ecological and socio-technical considerations,
    and that fail to recognize the value of design, testing and validation, with sustainability
    and people in mind (Chen et al., 2008, Trist, 1981). The mitigation of the undesirable
    consequences of existing and emerging technologies and IS necessitates intervention
    in the form of sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017, Smith et al.,
    2005), moving beyond the existing multi-level perspective (Geels, 2004, Geels,
    2011) toward transdisciplinarity. At the heart of these transitions is the establishment
    and socio-technical (re)design of higher education frameworks resulting in new
    forms of knowledge production, allowing for the design and redesign of human-centered
    socio-technical systems for sustainability, and consequently for human benefit
    (Geels, 2010, Verbong and Geels, 2010). The proposed socio-technical intervention
    would require commitment to a series of stages or flows, as depicted in Fig. 1,
    which we define as the Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle. These include:
    (i) establishing a detailed understanding and conceptualization of the tightly
    coupled natural and human systems in context and in view of interactions and feedback
    loops; (ii) implementing the appropriate sustainability transition through a process
    of socio-technical (re)design; (iii) measuring the effect of the design over time
    in view of the degree to which negative externalities are reduced or mitigated;
    (iv) assessing the impact on human health and wellbeing, in addition to environmental
    sustainability; and (v) iterating to ensure continual evaluation of the tightly
    coupled system given its evolving nature. It should be noted that despite this
    proposed cycle, there will be cases in which paradoxical externalities occur,
    which is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of tightly coupled systems.
    This occurs for two reasons: (i) events in nature are not always predictable no
    matter how “controlled” the socio-technical transitions are through, for example,
    regulation and policy mandates (Smith et al., 2005), and (ii) interventions themselves
    are a form of “technology” that are subject to independent and autonomous forces
    that are “uncontrollable” (Winner, 1978). Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    cycle. 3.2.7.2. Sustainability transitions through transdisciplinarity The proposed
    model suggests that our global challenges and significant problems require a transdisciplinary
    lens, beyond a multi-level perspective, in which design interventions are required
    in the form of sustainability transitions. Within this model, the information
    systems discipline has a significant and mediating role given its socio-technical
    orientation and appreciation of the open systems paradigm (Scott and Davis, 2015,
    von Bertalanffy, 1950, Watson et al., 2010). For instance, step (ii) in Fig. 1
    would markedly involve a redefinition of technological and information system
    design and development processes (Schoormann, Stadtländer, & Knackstedt, 2021),
    characterized by the emergence of a supportive human-centered, transdisciplinary
    educational framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015) oriented toward a public interest
    technology (PIT) research agenda (Abbas et al., 2021a, McGuinness and Schank,
    2021, Michael and Abbas, 2020). Transdisciplinarity, in the context of the proposed
    sustainability transitions, typifies trans-institutional, trans-sectoral and trans-national
    frameworks bringing together at a minimum industry, government and academia toward
    the production of knowledge (Crow & Dabars, 2017, p. 474; Hadorn, 2008). This
    involves recognition that while all problems are local and community focused,
    their impacts are increasingly global, given the age of entanglement we now live
    in (Hillis, 2016 as cited in Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 381), and the tight coupling
    of natural and human systems, as described above. In considering sustainability
    transitions more specifically, the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design
    Cycle would promote Public Interest Technology (PIT) research, empowering citizens
    and communities (Pitt, Michael, & Abbas, 2021). It would additionally emphasize
    the importance of directing attention to highly integrative basic and responsive
    (HIBAR) research (Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 376), which is still lacking internationally,
    despite the creation of globally oriented goals such as the United Nations Millennium
    Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Health
    Organization, 2015). In transitioning to HIBAR research and practice that requires
    PIT processes and innovations, we are seeking to recognize negative externalities
    and to continually strive to reduce them by introducing alternative socio-technical
    design options in each selection environment (Nelson & Winter, 1977, pp. 61–70).
    3.2.7.3. A public interest technology research agenda for sustainability A preliminary
    phase in operationalising the proposed design cycle and implementing sustainability
    transitions is the strategic realignment of IS, and/or the higher education system
    to proceed toward the production of knowledge and socio-technical innovations
    that are purpose driven and in the public interest (Abbas & Michael, 2021), facilitating
    an integrated and responsive approach to addressing our global challenges and
    key problems (Melville, 2010). Capturing first principles from foundational theories
    and frameworks across disciplines, including IS, and merging them to form a transdisciplinary
    lens will allow for the creation of models and simulations that afford a high-level
    view or conceptualization of existing major forces and counterforces (Frodeman,
    2014, Scholz, 2020). Achieving such a capability commands stakeholder engagement
    in the provision of data to an emergent knowledge system, encapsulating multi-level
    perspectives (local-national-global) within socio-cultural, business, techno-economic
    and institutionally-relevant policy contexts (Köhler et al., 2019). We suggest
    that the role of emerging technologies and IS, as they relate to this knowledge
    system, be embedded within a PIT framework (see Abbas, Pitt, & Michael, 2021,
    Fig. 1), represented as a complex, open socio-technical ecosystem that is informed
    by the landscape of technological and IS developments. The framework also acknowledges
    the corresponding application areas and the link to financing models, stakeholder
    engagement (balancing lived experience and professional expertise), transdisciplinary
    theorizations/conceptualizations and operationalisation to achieve the goal of
    sustainability toward human health and wellbeing (Abbas et al., 2021). 3.2.7.4.
    The role of IS/IT education The subsequent and corresponding phase in operationalising
    the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle relates to the elimination
    of disciplinary silos in higher education institutions, that have existed since
    scientific endeavor was acknowledged as the foundation of the Age of Enlightenment.
    Through the deliberate reconfiguration or redesign of university structures, new
    transdisciplinary agendas can be positioned to respond to global challenges (Crow
    & Dabars, 2015, ch. 5; Gholami, Watson, Hasan, Molla, & Bjorn-Andersen, 2016).
    In order to ensure our long-term sustainability as a species and a planet, university
    design must undergo a rapid rethink, becoming more adaptive and agile but also
    closely aligning to public and planetary challenges (Crow & Dabars, 2020). The
    transition to transdisciplinarity, even interdisciplinarity, remains fraught with
    risk principally with respect to forming meaningful ties between Computing, Informatics,
    Business (including Information Systems) and Engineering schools in addition to
    other non-STEM domains of knowledge. A harmonization is required not only within
    the STEM disciplines, but going beyond traditional collaborative fields to incorporate
    action-oriented endeavors through the creation of Schools dedicated to Sustainability
    or Life Sciences (Tejedor, Segalàs, & Rosas-Casals, 2018). Here the traditional
    research university is challenged to apply itself to real-world problems. However,
    irrespective of the inevitable difficulties, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated
    the importance of solidarity toward collective action, harnessing the knowledge
    produced from both professional expertise/practice and the lived experience. The
    IS discipline is in a prime position to offer information and knowledge management
    expertise to support transdisciplinarity, and it is our obligation to actively
    implement sustainability transitions and responsible systems design (Monson, 2021),IS
    research (Pan & Zhang, 2020) and innovation (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten, 2013)
    in the interest of sustainable futures (Hadorn et al., 2006, Hess and Ostrom,
    2007). 3.3. Impact on people and communities 3.3.1. Contribution 13 – promoting
    IT innovation to improve the global environment: towards establishment of global
    co-creation & co-evolution models – Professor Mitsuru Kodama 3.3.1.1. IT innovation
    through convergence The leading core technologies in the cutting-edge technology
    fields of IT, energy, automobiles, electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology,
    pharmaceuticals and materials science, etc. have become dispersed among individuals,
    companies and organizations across the globe. The integration of these superior
    core technologies is a source of innovation of new products and services. (e.g.,
    Kodama, 2007). Across various fields in society, IT innovation is changing working
    practices, lifestyles, the way products are made and resources are used in production
    activities. IT technology is being incorporated into a variety of advanced devices
    and contributing directly and indirectly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IT
    innovation is driving energy-efficient manufacturing by promoting energy-saving
    investments and measures. Such IT innovation will bring about “convergence” -
    the fusion and integration of different technologies and services and the building
    of business models across different industries. Meanwhile, with the adoption of
    the Paris Agreement, a new international framework for the reduction of greenhouse
    gas emissions and other measures from 2020, all participating countries, including
    those that are developed, emerging and developing, are strongly urged to take
    measures to combat global warming. Specifically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been trending globally in recent years while
    collaboration and fusion of the IT industry with various other industrial fields
    is transforming various businesses, social activities and the lives of people.
    Backing the evolution of these innovative technologies is the convergence of IT
    and electronics technologies, including sensing and location information technologies,
    energy management systems (HEMS, BEMS, FEMS, etc.), energy-saving devices and
    data utilization. Furthermore, smart communities such as smart towns and smart
    cities, into which many countries are currently pouring efforts, are attracting
    attention as next-generation social systems that connect homes, buildings, and
    transportation systems with IT networks to make effective local use of energy.
    IT solutions including energy management systems such as HEMS, BEMS and FEMS to
    optimize operation smart meters, renewable energy and EVs, etc., and CEMS to integrate
    the management of those as well as transportation systems such as ITS are becoming
    indispensable in smart communities. The development of these innovative technologies
    will greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and enable a dramatic
    increase in energy reduction benefits. Furthermore, XR technology, which has a
    promising future, will contribute directly and indirectly to global environmental
    issues by minimizing the physical resources generated, utilized, and consumed
    in various processes in social, economic, and management activities. Therefore,
    IT industries in every country need to contribute to global society by further
    strengthening technological and business partnerships with various industries,
    supply chains and venture businesses to promote new technologies and businesses
    through convergence strategies that will open up the future while understanding
    environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures. To date, the
    advances of IT have shortened the time and space in business processes and supply
    chains across a whole range of industries, accelerated decision-making and raised
    business efficiency, and have given birth to new business models that transcend
    and converge dissimilar industries (Kodama, 2020, Kodama, 2021). IT innovation
    promotes industry-wide co-creation & co-evolution to improve the global environment
    and increases the possibility of forming dynamic “global ecosystems” as new value
    chains (see Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (897KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global IT innovation through IT- leadership. Through such
    convergence, what actions should companies, public bodies, government organizations,
    and a country as a whole take in terms of strategy building and organizational
    reform to create new business models that integrate different technologies and
    create IT innovations across industries? What kind of national leadership and
    management is required to achieve this? These are just a few of the many practical
    issues facing many stakeholders around the world, including those in academic
    research. 3.3.1.2. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS While individual industries,
    companies, and governmental organizations in each country have their own strategies,
    the key concept of organizational behavior to adapt to (or create) the convergence
    worldview is new “strategic knowledge integration” at the global level. Organizational
    platforms that support such global strategic knowledge integration are global
    IT community formations. Global IT communities are important organizational platforms
    for evolving the core knowledge in one’s own country while at the same time actively
    exploring and integrating the best knowledge from around the world with the core
    knowledge of one’s own country (see Fig. 2). To drive global strategic knowledge
    integration, the most crucial issue is not only to integrate the diverse knowledge
    of different organizations within a company, but also to form global IT communities
    with superior stakeholders including customers around the world and integrate
    the best knowledge in the external environment, an ecosystem consisting of globally
    dispersed knowledge, with the knowledge in the organizations within a company.
    The key word to accelerate such global knowledge integration inside and outside
    an organization is “IT collaboration”. In forming global IT communities across
    the world, “collaborative dynamic capabilities” (Kodama, 2018) to appropriately
    generate, evaluate, and use common knowledge (i.e., lexicon, meaning, and interests)
    (Carlile, 2004) regarding environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures
    among diverse stakeholders, are a trigger to realize IT collaboration. In addition,
    the “IT-leadership” of national leaders is crucial to accelerate new strategic
    knowledge integration through IT collaboration through the formation of global
    IT communities across a wide range of countries. For this purpose, “holistic leadership”
    (Kodama, 2017) through the holistic thinking and actions of world leaders will
    be a particularly important factor of management. However, existing studies in
    the IM/IT/IS fields have shed little light on the details of the theoretical concepts
    and practical processes of global IT community formation. Furthermore, there is
    very little accumulated research on IT collaboration. The holistic IT-leadership
    of leaders will play a role in forming and developing the organizational platforms
    of global IT communities. Hence, the cultivation of such leaders will become a
    pressing issue going forward. 3.3.2. Contribution 14 – smart city initiatives
    to maximize information value for sustainability – Professor Brenda Scholtz The
    growing population, particularly in urban areas, has put pressure on researchers
    and society to address challenges surrounding the global lack of scarce resources
    and the negative impact on the environment (Khatoun and Zeadally, 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2020). The technological footprint of companies and individuals has exacerbated
    this problem since technologies are mainly reliant on fossil fuel, thus the more
    technology used, the more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, creating
    global warming. Technology manufacturers and implementers therefore need to consider
    adopting practices of environmentally sustainable computing. This phenomenon can
    be viewed as sustainability in technology or Green IT, where the priority must
    be to reduce the negative impact of an organization’s technological footprint.
    On the other hand some argue that providing individuals and organizations with
    access to information and technology can assist people with living more conveniently
    and easily; for example reducing travel and our carbon footprint. This phenomenon
    can be referred to as sustainability by technology, whereby we need to reduce
    the negative impact of companies and their value chains by enabling sustainability
    use cases or initiatives. The interplay of sustainability in technology and by
    technology must therefore be addressed by all stakeholders in industry and academia.
    One solution to achieving this interplay is to utilize the capabilities of information
    management (IM) and the related field of information systems (IS), which are reliant
    on the acquisition of information, the custodianship and distribution of that
    information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through archiving
    or deletion thereof. However, valuable information can only be provided to users
    if access to data is available. The Economist has described data as “the oil of
    the digital era”. However, others, such as the Centre on Regulation in Europe,
    argue that this “often-used analogy between data and oil is misleading.” Their
    argument is that data, unlike oil, is not scarce and therefore it cannot be likened
    to oil (MacCarthy, 2018). One thing that everyone agrees on, is that the digital
    economy cannot live without data and that it remains an immeasurably valuable
    and unexplored asset. More than 90% of the world’s data has been created in the
    last two years – more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. We are experiencing
    an information explosion. Herbert Simon, the Nobel prize-winning psychologist
    and economist, stated way back in 1971 that “In an information-rich world, the
    wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever
    it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious:
    it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates
    a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among
    the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” (Bélanger, Van
    Slyke, & Crossler, 2018). The potential value of data, information flow and technology
    to address the effective management of scarce resources has been the driver of
    the Smart City concept (Ismagilova et al., 2019). According to Albino, Berardi,
    and Dangelico (2015): “A Smart City is based on intelligent exchanges of information
    that flow between its many different subsystems. This flow of information is analyzed
    and translated into citizen and commercial services. The city will act on this
    information flow to make its wider ecosystem more resource-efficient and sustainable.
    The information exchange is based on a Smart Governance operating framework designed
    to make cities sustainable”. The promotion of a Smart Environment is one of the
    core dimensions of a Smart City (Van der Hoogen, Scholtz, & Calitz, 2020). The
    success factors that are linked to this dimension are the attractiveness of natural
    conditions, environmental protection policies, having a sustainability strategy
    for resource management, and making sure that a city is ‘future proof’. A sustainability
    strategy should enable an integrated view of socio-economic, political and environmental
    visions; thus focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
    Nations. Future-proof refers to the ability of something that allows it to continue
    to be of value into the distant future such that the item does not become obsolete.
    Another core dimension for a Smart City is that of Smart Policy, meaning that
    any Smart City initiative should align with the strategy of the city, the country
    (government laws), intergovernmental agreements and of course global policies
    (Garg et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). Policies here include environmental policies
    and those related to information governance and therefore IM. The privacy of personal
    data and information is causing much concern and therefore acts and regulations
    are important in the context of a Smart City. In South Africa the Protection of
    Personal Information Act (POPIA) was implemented in 2013 to protect the information
    and privacy of people, but was only enforced on 1 July 2020 (POPIA, 2020). The
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European equivalent to the POPIA
    for South Africa (GDPR, 2018). In addition to these acts, companies are also pushed
    to have their own information governance and management policies and guidelines.
    Another dimension that is closely linked to climate change issues is that of Smart
    Mobility. This dimension focuses on factors that involve sustainable, innovative
    and safe transport systems that are accessible locally, nationally and internationally
    (Calderón et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). IoT is an integral part of Smart
    Mobility and is regarded as an enabling technology of big data (Bibri, 2019).
    However, big data is only valuable once quality data is produced, which is required
    for intelligent decision making to contribute to sustainable smart cities. The
    Smart City definition illustrates the importance of information exchange within
    a Smart City and therefore the importance of the provision of open data and the
    creation of open data hubs. Smart Technology and ICT-infrastructure is considered
    a support dimension of a Smart City since it is integral to all the other dimensions.
    It refers to the different types of smart technologies that are used in a Smart
    City and since these technologies produce and utilize data, it also involves relating
    all the data in smarter ways. Some of the opportunities for smart cities are that
    the data is in a digital format through IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    machine learning technologies, making real-time collection, processing and sharing
    easier and therefore, decision making and solution development is becoming faster
    and more advanced (Allam & Dhunny, 2019). Providing access to quality data through
    the related strategy of information governance is becoming more and more critical.
    Information governance is the overall strategy for information and provides a
    balance between the risks of the information with the value that this information
    can provide. Data quality forms part of governance, since it is focused on the
    integrity and value of the information itself. When the factors of a Smart City
    concept are integrated, such as ICT, urban infrastructure, open data with data
    governance, and stakeholder participation, equitable and sustainable solutions
    can be developed to face city challenges (Yadav et al., 2017). Stakeholder participation
    is emphasized in the Smart People dimension of a Smart City and it is here that
    the importance of skills, qualifications and education is addressed. The lack
    of skills lies in the areas of IT/IS and Computer Science graduates in general,
    but in particular with regard to Data Science, AI and machine learning competencies.
    Higher education has started addressing the need for these competencies in the
    recent IS2020 curricula guidelines (IS2020, 2020). Competencies related to sustainability
    and environmental issues are also included in the IS2020 guidelines as social
    and ethical considerations. In Germany and South Africa modules related to Green
    IT, and environmental information systems have been introduced in recent years.
    So whilst some progress has been made, much more effort and investigations need
    to take place to introduce more competencies regarding sustainable technologies,
    data management, data analytics and data science into IS/IT and CS degree programs.
    Much research has been done on the topics of smart cities, Green IT and ICT for
    sustainability. However, reported empirical studies on IS for meeting the SDGs
    are still considerably low, particularly with regard to sustainable management
    of water and sanitation (SDG 6); access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
    modern energy for all (SDG 7); and conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas
    and sustainable behavior (SDG 14). In Africa and other developing countries these
    three SDGs are far from being met, where access to clean water and energy are
    major problems for the vast majority of the population. There is also a lack of
    valuable information and empirical research regarding emerging smart cities, especially
    in developing countries (Backhouse, 2015, Estevez et al., 2016). This lack of
    information prevents stakeholders from making informed decisions, such as how
    to manage the city resources more efficiently or how to attract potential investors.
    3.3.3. Contribution 15 – wider issues in IS research on climate change – Professor
    Rahul De’ In The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, noted
    writer Amitav Ghosh (2018) points to the absence of writing on the destruction
    of nature and habitats through the devastation wrought by Imperialism and the
    rise of industrial capitalism. He calls this absence in the canon of English literature
    the ‘great derangement’ where thinkers and intellectuals are oblivious to the
    plainly visible damage done to the planet. This neglect of climate change continued
    in writings in history and politics. Ghosh calls for an awakening to recognize
    and give voice to the scale of the ‘unthinkable’ impact of this phenomenon. Ghosh’s
    call resonates in IS research, where this phenomenon is recognized as a ‘critical
    challenge’ for researchers and practitioners (Gholami et al., 2016; Eliot and
    Webster, 2017). The call is for more extensive research on climate change and
    its impact on the world, where ‘grand challenges’ require a wider understanding
    of the phenomena and a scoping that includes ideas and concepts outside of current
    disciplinary concerns (Winter & Butler, 2011). Following this reasoning, three
    possible issues are presented in this brief essay that can address the scale of
    climate change concerns, and, which also resonate with prior IS research. These
    ideas have to do with engaging with issues of the postcolonial condition; a focus
    on the impact of climate change on ordinary people; and its impact on women. 3.3.3.1.
    Focus on postcolonial condition Prior research in IS has examined the postcolonial
    condition prevailing in former colonies of large imperial nations of the West,
    which includes most of the developing and less-developed world (Lin et al., 2015,
    Ravishankar et al., 2013). This condition essentially refers to the power asymmetry
    between former rulers and the ruled, and defines the cultural and political practices
    of both, even though there is no present-day colonial presence. The postcolonial
    condition is perpetuated largely through multinational corporations and global
    agencies. Global actors, such as large multinational corporations and multilateral
    agencies (like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), have a massive
    and disproportionate effect on world affairs. Their beliefs, policies, and practices
    affect millions of people directly and indirectly, as they influence governments
    and the actions that governments take. These institutions have a strong influence
    on the uptake of information technology in many nations, through efforts such
    as electronic governance, ICT for development, and spread of technologies to reduce
    the digital divide (De, Pal, Sethi, Reddy, & Chitre, 2018). They also have a strong
    influence on industrialization, deforestation, energy consumption patterns, and
    the overall adoption of modern technologies. Prior research has shown that many
    “development” projects ultimately harm subaltern people, who are the poor and
    marginal groups, rather than benefit them (Ferguson, 1994), and scholars often
    doubt the very benefits of development in such situations and contexts (Escobar,
    2011). Green IS research that is concerned with recording and analyzing the impact
    of climate change (Melville, 2010) must also document the postcolonial conditions
    and the impact of multilateral agencies. When agencies fund, say, construction
    of roads or dams or massive irrigation projects, the impact on the environment
    must be documented and the particulars of local politics, struggles, and contestation
    must be recorded. Crowd-sourcing technologies may be used to both record the different
    perspectives of people, and also to arrive at a possible consensus (Malone & Klein,
    2007). 3.3.3.2. Focus on people Though there is considerable work on Green IT
    and Green IS from the perspective of organizations and how they can manage their
    consumption and production patterns (Dedrick, 2010, Khuntia et al., 2018, Melville,
    2010), the emphasis must also include the manner in which ordinary people in urban
    and rural areas, in remote mountainous regions, on isolated islands, and in forests
    are affected, and how they are using IT to both learn about and counter the effects
    of climate change (Watson et al., 2021). The focus can be on local and indigenous
    approaches to adapting to climate change, and how digital technologies can support
    those, with information and feedback. One problem that can be addressed through
    both design science and action research is that of measuring the changes that
    are slowly and inevitably happening, and how people are adapting to them. These
    changes are in local climate conditions, in soil composition, in levels of water
    tables and aquifers, and in the extent and survival of local flora and fauna.
    These changes may be viewed from multiple perspectives of resource depletion for
    businesses or from that of people’s livelihood, and the impact on local sustainability
    (Clarke & Davison, 2020). 3.3.3.3. Focus on gender Theorizing about climate change
    around issues of mitigation and impact cannot be “gender blind” (Pearse, 2017).
    In rural areas, the brunt of droughts, flooding, soil degradation, river erosion,
    salinization, and loss of food crops, is felt largely by women (Alston, 2015).
    With these drastic and adverse changes in agricultural conditions, there follows
    shortages in food, nutrition deficiency for both women and children, loss of livelihood,
    and increase in debt (Chandra, McNamara, Dargusch, Caspe, & Dalabajan, 2017).
    Though both men and women suffer the consequences of extreme climate events, it
    is women who are worse off as national policies do not fully account for them,
    and relief measures are not easily accessible to them. When climate change events
    force populations to migrate, women are worse off as they lose their local social
    networks, are subject to abuse, and are unable to secure livelihoods on foreign
    soil. The gender imbalances are exacerbated and become entrenched (Alston, 2015).
    Prior research in IS has established the imbalanced access that women have to
    both ICT devices and facilities in developing regions (Rashid, 2016). As they
    are most prone to adverse effects of climate change, research has to both reveal
    these deprivation issues, and find ways to address them. 3.3.3.4. Conclusion IS
    research has an opportunity to sidestep the great derangement in literary culture
    by both exposing the causes and consequences of climate change, and finding ways
    and means to address them. Some work has already started on understanding concerns
    of postcolonial dominance, identifying issues of ordinary people, and understanding
    the particular challenges faced by women. Future research will likely build on
    this. 3.4. Responsible digitalization 3.4.1. Contribution 16 – corporate digital
    responsibility: the powerful offspring of sustainability and digitization – Professor
    Michael Wade 3.4.1.1. Two dominant trends Two of the most significant global business
    trends over the past several years have been sustainability and digitization.
    Sustainability revolves around the natural world, most notably humanity’s impact
    on our planet. Digitization, by contrast, focuses on the virtual world. Without
    obvious common roots, these two megatrends have largely developed independently
    of one another (Naujok, Fleming, & Srivatsav, 2018). I recently had a conversation
    with the Chief Sustainability Officer of a consumer goods company and when I asked
    him about digital and sustainability, he looked back at me blankly. However, this
    is likely to change. If we expand the definition of sustainability to include
    responsible and ethical practices of all kinds, not just those that impact the
    planet, we see plenty of intersection points. Examples include cyber-security,
    data privacy protection of employees and customers, digital diversity and inclusion,
    ethical algorithms including AI, technology component recycling, right to repair,
    ethical gig economy practices, and there are many others. Unfortunately, our research
    suggests that most organizations today are unprepared to effectively respond to
    these challenges. If they do so at all, it is in a fragmented manner. This opens
    up new and interesting avenues for research. 3.4.1.2. A new field of corporate
    digital responsibility It is time to bring these disparate and fragmented elements
    together under a single umbrella so that they can be addressed in a consistent
    and complementary manner. We refer to this new consolidated focus as Corporate
    Digital Responsibility (CDR) (Lobschat et al., 2021). CDR can be regarded as a
    subset of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), an already established entity
    in many organizations. Corporate digital responsibility is defined as a set of
    practices and behaviors that help an organization use data and digital technologies
    in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally responsible (Wade,
    2020). 3.4.1.3. Each CDR sub-categories contains a number of areas Social Corporate
    Digital Responsibility revolves around an organization’s relationship to people
    and society. The important topic of data privacy protection of customers, employees,
    and other stakeholders is included here. It also incorporates aspects of digital
    diversity and inclusion, such as bridging an increasing divide between digital
    haves and have nots across geographies, industries, social classes, and age. There
    are also societal impacts of inaccurate A.I. decision-making algorithms that can
    lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, as has been noted among many recommendation
    engines (Noriega, 2020). Other technologies can also have harmful effects on society.
    Facebook, among others, banned so-called deep fake videos that realistically apply
    false or misleading statements to real people. Economic Corporate Digital Responsibility
    relates to the responsible management of the economic impacts of digital technologies.
    Much has been said about the replacement of human jobs by robots and other digital
    technologies, and this is certainly a relevant part of economic CDR. Yet, it also
    relates to the creation of new jobs in a digital world that are enriching, purposeful,
    and interesting. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the so-called gig
    economy creates jobs that are often uninteresting, repetitive, and underpaid (Tan
    Z.M., 2021). There are also questions regarding the sharing of the economic benefits
    of digitization with society through taxation of digital work, and fair compensation
    of data monetization to the original owners. Finally, Environmental Corporate
    Digital Responsibility concerns the link between digital technologies and the
    physical environment. There are many issues here, including the responsible recycling
    or disposal of old computer equipment. The extension of obsolescence cycles by
    one year, for example, can have an enormous impact on the environment.5 There
    are also issues regarding the limiting of power consumption, including reducing
    the use of electricity to support bitcoin mining. 3.4.1.4. A call for a multi-disciplinary
    focus on CDR Many organizational processes, practices, and projects exist to address
    digital aspects of social, economic, and environmental responsibility. Yet, they
    are rarely coordinated or optimized. Some, like cybersecurity, tend to be the
    responsibility of IT departments, others, like workforce automation, may fall
    under the purview of operations, and yet other elements may sit with HR, legal,
    engineering, R&D, or particular lines of business. Without effective coordination,
    organizations leave themselves open to risks, and may miss out on rewards. Research
    too, is required to better understand the dynamics of CDR from both theoretical
    and empirical perspectives. This research will need to be multi-disciplinary since
    CDR covers aspects of many different fields, including IS (the coordination of
    technology and people), IT (the ethical design of technologies themselves), operations
    (the development of systems and practices to embed CDR in organizational processes),
    organizational design (how to set up structures to effectively govern CDR activities),
    strategy (how to align CDR with other organizational objectives), and OB (how
    to train people to act in responsible ways). In summary, as the sustainability
    and digitization trends continue to grow, Corporate Digital Responsibility will
    become increasingly relevant for organizational performance, both to mitigate
    risks as well as find new sources of advantage. As researchers, we need to get
    ahead of this trend not only to better understand it, but to influence its development
    through the creation and dissemination of tools, frameworks and best practices
    to practicing managers. 3.4.2. Contribution 17 – digitalization and the myth of
    sustainability: some critical reflections – Professor Suprateek Sarker Digitalization
    is all around us, and we are all well aware of the value digitalization brings
    to help improve many facets of human existence. Indeed, when we think about digitalization,
    most of us see the positive impacts digitalization has had, and can potentially
    have, on the environment. After all, in digitizing business processes, we drastically
    reduce, even eliminate the consumption of paper, which saves trees, and in turn
    contributes to better environmental outcomes. We also think of how, through metering,
    we are able to encourage consumers to consume less electricity, which again contributes
    to better environmental outcomes (e.g., Wunderlich, Veit, & Sarker, 2019). Perhaps
    a more high-profile example that we can all relate to pertains to the new generation
    of automobiles, that have been described as “computers on wheels” (Wade, 2016).
    Digitalization vehicles can help to optimize fuel and/or battery usage, and hence
    result in less pollution of the environment. Furthermore, metaphors like ‘cloud’
    imply something floating and delicate” and green, and add to our sense that digitalization
    is at the heart of our battle to save the environment (Crawford, 2021, p. 41)
    and can have a significant role in addressing climate change. Yet, many argue
    that the above represents a grossly biased picture, and is a consequence of the
    largely pro-digitalization, “digital utopia” narrative which includes the myth6
    of digitalization’s contribution to sustainability, that is promoted by tech companies,
    sections of the business press, and those fascinated by the wonders of digitalization.
    Crawford (2021), among others, provides a critical commentary on the “mineralogical
    layer” (p. 32) underlying digital technologies and AI that made me acutely aware
    of the environmental effects associated with digitalization. She notes that “seventeen
    rare earth elements,” that are part of virtually every digital device/technology
    surrounding us, have to be extracted from mines. Mining of such minerals is not
    only associated with slavery, conflicts, and human exploitation very often, but
    also results in dangerous waste. Specifically, she quotes David Abraham who writes
    “. 99.8% of earth removed in rare earth mining is discarded as waste… that are
    dumped back into the hills and streams” and this leads to “pollutants like ammonium…”
    (pp. 36–37). Particularly alarming is the estimate by the Chinese Society of Rare
    Earths that refining one ton of these elements “produces 75,000 liters of acidic
    water and one ton of radioactive residue” (p. 37). The amount of consumption of
    water and electricity by data centers and other components of the digital infrastructure
    is also shocking, but is largely hidden from view or consciousness of the average
    consumer or decision-maker, who is led to believe that digitalization is “clean”
    and a key part of the solution for the environmental crisis (pp. 42–45). Along
    similar lines, Wade (2016) suggests that in addition to batteries and their deleterious
    environmental impacts, “rare metals are sprinkled throughout vehicles, mostly
    in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.
    But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive
    mines… and processed in less-than-green ways.” The point of highlighting the above
    issues is not that digitalization needs to stop. The point is to make people aware
    that there are environmental trade-offs that we are implicitly making when we
    use digital technologies. Indeed, by many accounts, the clean paperless image
    has been carefully cultivated, and it distorts the assessment of environmental
    impacts in one direction, in favor of further digitalization. As IS researchers
    who embrace the sociotechnical view (e.g., Sarker, Chatterjee, Xiao, & Elbanna,
    2019), we are aware that the need for efficiency, effectiveness, and economic
    value needs to be balanced with a consideration of humanistic outcomes. Given
    the critical role that the environment, especially in the form of climate change,
    is seen to play in shaping human wellbeing (even threaten survival), we need to
    consider environmental outcomes as an undeniable aspect of humanistic outcomes
    of digitalization. While outlining a research program is not feasible in a short
    editorial segment, there are a few points I would like to make, that may have
    implications for research and teaching: As researchers and teachers, we need to
    develop and communicate a balanced picture of digitalization, and not unreflectively
    perpetuate the “digital utopia” narrative. We must reflect on the culture that
    our societies have developed, of technology infusion in human processes as a natural
    course of development of organizations, economies, and societies. We need to develop
    frameworks and metrics that will help managers and technology consumers assess
    the economic value and convenience with respect to the true costs. Just as we
    have metrics to capture the economic value of digital technology implementation,
    we need to develop and incorporate the use of environment-related criteria and
    metrics as part of the proposal and justification process for any significant
    digitization initiative. At a very basic level, we need to ask why we need digital
    technology infusion in a certain aspect of life, and whether it is warranted when
    a holistic assessment is done. And, we need to develop conceptual and analytic
    tools to be able to carry out such assessments, even if such analysis is initially
    far from perfect. Obviously, the environmental damage resulting from the harnessing
    of digital technologies is a systemic issue involving many different stakeholders,
    and IS scholars cannot solve the problems themselves, but we need to actively
    consider how we may be part of the solution. We need to become aware of the issues,
    make the environmental costs transparent in our communication with stakeholders,
    conduct revelatory studies of the hidden environmental costs of certain technologies
    that are extolled, create models that incorporate benefits and costs including
    environmental costs, and, most importantly, make our students aware of the one-sidedness
    of the pro-digitalization narrative. We need to incorporate environmental impact
    analysis of digitalization initiatives as part of the IS curriculum, and foster
    an environmental consciousness among the students with respect to digitalization.
    Undoubtedly, a lot of research will be needed to enable decision makers to link
    environmental costs to a particular decision pertaining to digitalization. Many
    of us talk about responsible AI – here, my objective is to encourage responsible
    digitalization, and the responsibility is regarding environmental impacts of digitalization.
    As we set out on this path, I reiterate that our goal will not be to single-mindedly
    promote or oppose digitalization, but to “right-size” the extent of digital infusion
    in any initiative, after careful consideration of benefits and costs, where costs
    will not only consider the immediate tangible financial implications but also
    environmental costs over time that humanity will be left to bear. 3.4.3. Contribution
    18 – systems for sustainable growth – Professor Maung Sein and Dr Leona Chandra
    Kruse “Stark realities, critical choices […] Years, or even decades, of progress
    have been halted or reversed.” These alarming statements began this year’s Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) report, underlining the gloomy consequences of COVID
    19 related crises. The prospect, however, is not all doom and gloom. Digital transformation
    has been accelerated in various governmental and business sectors, and we need
    to continue harnessing the potentials of information systems to address key societal,
    economic, and ecological issues. Supported by well-designed information systems,
    researchers, economic actors, policymakers, and civil society can join forces
    to rebuild a more resilient and sustainable future. Perhaps no issue is more crucial
    now than the threat of climate change. This is not just an isolated threat: it
    directly challenges our conceptualization of sustainable growth and sustainability
    itself. We view sustainability as a synergy across people, planet, and profit,
    following the SDGs. We place a particular emphasis on a holistic view of information
    systems (IS) for sustainability which entails the study of designing, engineering,
    using, and disposing of information systems in order to minimize their environmental
    impact as well as to promote sustainability-related practices. This holistic view
    embraces different initiatives across various computing and informatics disciplines
    in the spirit of transdisciplinarity and multilateralism. In the following, we
    will delve into the role of IS in this crucial discourse on the threat of climate
    change. We will first set the scene by providing our perspective on IS and sustainability.
    We will then propose specific approaches that the IS research community can take
    to address the issues we raise. We will conclude our editorial segment by discussing
    issues related to evaluating the initiatives and frameworks aimed at meeting sustainability
    challenges. 3.4.3.1. Setting the scene The thirteenth SDG persuades us to “take
    urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,” and this year’s report
    continues to urge us on how “rising greenhouse gas emissions require shifting
    economies towards carbon neutrality” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 20). For us,
    this urging means exploring new and alternative approaches to minimize the environmental
    impact of information systems, in addition to our ongoing measures. We observe
    several ongoing transdisciplinary movements to this end. One of them, computing
    within limits, aims to reshape computing research by acknowledging a need for
    limits (LIMITS, 2021). This movement is guided by three core ideas: aiming for
    a steady-state economy and acknowledging the limit of growth, considering models
    of scarcity in order to promote resilience, and reducing energy and material consumption
    while avoiding the rebound effect (Nardi et al., 2018). Rethinking the status
    quo in our design and computing assumptions can help us shape the way forward.
    Minimizing the environmental impact of information systems, however, concerns
    not only the design and use period. We need to anticipate what happens in the
    post-use period, that is, minimizing and managing e-waste. This is echoed by the
    twelfth SDG: “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” However,
    this year’s report shows that “electronic waste continues to proliferate and is
    not disposed of responsibly [.] Each person generates about 7.3 kg or e-waste,
    but only 1.7 kg was recycled” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 19). 3.4.3.2. Design
    science research for sustainability What can the IS community do to meet the enormous
    challenges posed by the threat of climate change in particular and to sustainability
    in general? The simple answer is that research needs to make this a key area to
    address. Understanding the phenomenon, explaining the mechanisms of climate change
    and predicting its consequences are agendas that continuously engage researchers
    from across the disciplines. We propose that the IS community can significantly
    contribute to these ongoing initiatives through designing artifacts (systems,
    prototypes, methods or frameworks). While designing systems in a way to best accomplish
    a particular purpose (combating climate change in our case here), lies at the
    very core of what we do in our discipline, our call here is to take a design science
    research (DSR) approach in our research. DSR aims at creating new prescriptive
    knowledge through building methods and artifacts to improve the world in some
    way, however incremental. The DSR paradigm is fundamentally a problem solving
    paradigm. It is not atheoretical tinkering – artifacts are developed based on
    theoretical and conceptual foundations, drawing upon the knowledge base for explanation
    research – and in the process creates theoretical and conceptual knowledge that
    are of prescriptive nature such as design principles that are transferable to
    other contexts. While care is taken to ensure rigor, the very fact that the artifacts
    developed through DSR are to solve problems faced by the society makes it relevant
    by definition. 3.4.3.3. Sustainability as value for design DSR is perfectly placed
    to meet the threats to sustainability. Among the papers and prototypes presented
    in the 2021 edition of the premier conference of the DSR community (Design Science
    Research in IS Technology – DESRIST), one is an excellent illustration of what
    the IS community can do. Hillebrand and Johannsen (2021) developed a chatbot called
    KlimaKarl “to Promote Employees’ Climate-Friendly Behavior in an Office Setting”.
    The App can be classified under “persuasive technology” that has been used successfully
    in the health sector to promote healthy living (e.g. weight management) through
    behavior change. Obviously such systems cannot force behavior change but can definitely
    informate users. A system of this genre can prove to be useful in the particular
    case of wind powered energy in Norway. While there is a broad support for developing
    green energy, many localities vehemently oppose constructing windmills in their
    areas. Systems can be effective in helping citizens see a balanced view and hopefully
    reduce opposition to windmills. DSR, like any research approach, is not value
    free (Iivari, 2010) and consequently, “the values of DSR should be made as explicit
    as possible” (p. 44). The burden of explicating the value of the designer and
    his/her goal in designing the artifact is essential to help the user understand
    the possible deleterious outcome or the unintended dark side of the technology.
    This is a particular sensitive issue with the use of persuasive technology in
    a debated issue such as sustainability. 3.4.3.4. Green practices within DSR Finally,
    environment-friendly practices such as green computing and green coding can be
    incorporated in the design of artifacts, whether as a DSR project or routine design.
    These practices help to minimize the environmental impact of the resulting information
    systems. The IS research community is also a user of IT. We need to be mindful
    of the potential e-waste of our research endeavor and ingrain e-waste management
    in our daily behavior. Some of the points in this editorial indeed represent critical
    choices which must be made in the face of the stark climate realities. 3.5. Role
    of data, technology and IS governance 3.5.1. Contribution 19 – climate change
    and role of information technologies – Professor Babita Gupta 3.5.1.1. Information
    technologies and climate change Information technologies require energy at every
    stage of its life-cycle and contribute to the carbon footprint. However, IT is
    also helping reduce net carbon emissions in various industry sectors. Technology-enhanced
    working using the video conferencing and cloud-based collaboration that has accelerated
    during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a double-edged sword (Frontier technologies,
    2020). While these technologies helped the environment by significantly reducing
    the impacts of travel and commuting, they also increased carbon emissions since
    the backend infrastructure, such as massive data centers, is enormously energy-intensive.
    Current estimates of information and communication technology (ICT) impact range
    from 1.4% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions, highlighting the need for accurate
    data on ICT’s impact on the environment (Cunliff, 2020, Murugesan, 2021, Robertson,
    2021). Several information technologies are poised to play a critical role in
    monitoring, managing, and mitigating climate change-related phenomena and increasing
    environmental resiliency. For example, artificial intelligence and robotics are
    being utilized for automated detection and monitoring of environmental hazards,
    remote sensing to track deforestation activities and marine life, monitoring biodiversity,
    traffic flow optimization, estimating real-time precipitations, and managing flood
    risks and emergency planning. Increasing occurrences of extreme weather events
    are affecting food production and distribution globally. Advancements in information
    technology utilizing multi-source spatial and temporal data, robotics, drones,
    Internet-of-Things (IoT), etc., are being explored in the agriculture and transport
    industry. For example, precision agriculture technology is an environmentally
    sustainable strategy for optimizing water input, weed control, disease eradication,
    pest reduction, and yield enhancement to avert water and food insecurity and optimize
    the food production chain. Data centers are the backbone for managing big data,
    cloud computing, AI, blockchain, and IoT. They also have massive power consumption
    needs contributing to climate change. Researchers and innovators are exploring
    novel technologies such as liquid cooling that improve heat-dissipation efficiency
    and reduce their impact on the environment to reduce the carbon footprint of data
    centers and other IT infrastructure. 3.5.1.2. Role of higher education in building
    environmental resiliency Higher education institutions can provide knowledge and
    resources to the learners and create awareness, inspiring the next generation
    to navigate the complexities of climate change. Education and training can encourage
    learners to think about technological and behavioral changes to reduce and mitigate
    environmental impact within their local sphere of influence and macro level. Institutions
    offering information systems and related programs are beginning to incorporate
    pedagogical practices in their curriculum that engage students to reflect on organizations’
    sustainable and responsible technology adoption and use practices. Educational
    institutions can create partnerships with community stakeholders to accelerate
    carbon-neutral business practices and build environmental resiliency. Several
    universities are forming coalitions committed to climate action, such as the University
    Climate Change Coalition, to leverage scientific knowledge and expertise for climate
    change solutions. In addition, universities are offering programs that emphasize
    environmental justice and equity, such as responsible business MBA and hospitality
    and sustainable management. 3.5.1.3. Research agenda and climate change The estimates
    for carbon dioxide levels in the year 2021 are at 417 parts per million. Bringing
    it down to the safer threshold of 350 parts per million would require the removal
    of about 2000 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the next century (Fork
    and Koningstein, 2021, Frontier Technologies to Protect the Environment and Tackle
    Climate Change, 2020). This reversal of climate change would require everyone’s
    effort, including researchers in the IT, information systems, and related areas,
    to develop a robust and practical research agenda: Methodologies to assess the
    sustainability of ICT Infrastructure. • Develop an actionable set of metrics that
    can measure the reliable and precise impact of an information technology infrastructure,
    an IT project, or a portion of the cloud in terms of its carbon budget and footprint
    • Develop reporting mechanisms, models, and infrastructure that would make it
    easy for companies to evaluate their as well as their supply chain partners’ emissions
    and environmental impact. Sustainable, greener technologies. • Strategies grounded
    in organization behavior and culture that persuade companies to shift from fossil-fuel-based
    electricity to using cleaner, renewable energy solutions in their IT projects,
    technology infrastructure, and data centers • Creating mechanisms for designing
    sustainable technologies compliant to be carbon-neutral in the ICT industry by
    2050 • Models for integrating disparate data and prediction models and forecast
    systems for weather, traffic, demand, patterns of consumption, and real-time inventory
    that companies can use to optimize their supply chain and reduce waste and carbon
    footprint • Best practices to make the entire life cycle of IT greener, including
    energy-efficient hardware and software that has reusable code and is optimized
    for the green hardware. Resource recovery and reducing e-waste. • Research on
    e-waste management and strategies for e-waste prevention, smart recycling, and
    resource recovery, without shifting the e-waste burden to still-developing economies.
    Use of behavioral theories to engage stakeholders in climate change solutions.
    • Research on the role of social media and models grounded in behavioral theories
    that can prevent or at least reduce the impact of misinformation on public perception
    of climate change • Strategies to empower consumers so that the collective consumer
    sentiment about climate change imperative can incentivize companies to pursue
    carbon net-zero more actively as a goal • Research on digital and social media
    best practices to increase consumer awareness of the impact of their purchasing
    choices and decisions on environmental sustainability and design strategies that
    nudge consumers to adopt behavior that reduces their carbon footprint. Role of
    governance in climate change innovations. • Research on the role of governments
    in enabling effective guidelines, policies, legislation, incentives, R&D collaborations,
    and regulations about emission standards versus companies setting voluntary targets
    for achieving carbon neutrality within the critical time frame. • Research on
    the role of policy governance within the organizations when implementing IT projects
    and the evaluating impact on the environment. • Research on the role of social
    media and other digital tools to influence leaders in government and businesses
    to embrace sustainable consumption and production. 3.5.2. Contribution 20 – climate
    crisis response: climate crisis response: complex information governance for social
    sustainability – Professor Deborah Bunker "Climate change is destroying our path
    to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited
    resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course."
    – Ban Ki-moon (2012). We are amid an existential climate crisis which has been
    building since the onset of the industrial revolution (Jonsson, 2012). Information
    systems (IS) scholars continue to debate our contributions to tackle climate change
    and sustainability. In response to the global climate crisis, we are being called
    upon to “develop suitable theoretical frameworks to underpin the investigation
    of complex phenomena and complex problems” on a societal level (Hasan, Smith,
    & Finnegan, 2017, p. 298). In response to any crisis, however, we know that to
    develop and deploy resources effectively, an IS must produce an accurate, reliable,
    and trustworthy assessment of the situation at scale (Bunker, 2020). The key to
    achieving this ''situational awareness'' is the development and implementation
    of an accepted approach to complex information governance for response to societal
    problems and crises (Bunker, 2020, Smith and Stirling, 2008, Nüttgens et al.,
    2011). How the value, authenticity; accuracy; reliability; and legality of information
    is determined, controlled, and assured through acceptable governance mechanisms,
    is at the heart of how information is represented and used to develop situational
    awareness and support sustainability goals for climate action ". the ways in which
    these representations are articulated into knowledge that structure our overall
    understandings" (Smith & Stirling, 2008 - p. 2). Complex information governance
    has, however, been shown to be difficult to assure as seen in the financial market
    failures of 2001 and 2008 and more generally in the response to the current COVID-19
    pandemic. Information governance is defined as "a collection of competences or
    practices for the creation, capture, valuation, storage, usage, control, access,
    archival, and the deletion of information and related resources over its life
    cycle" (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakos, & Krogstie, 2020). IS research on information
    governance, however, has mainly focussed on big data analytics and organizational
    innovation for formal IS. Far less is known about information governance in complex
    scenarios where formal IS and informal social IS might combine to jointly produce
    situational awareness on which to frame a response. Yet we know of many cases
    where trusted situational awareness, dynamic organizational collaboration and
    multi-stakeholder decision support have been produced by combining formal and
    informal IS. These include adoption and use of: – a cloud-based, freely available
    IS used by environmental non-government organizations (ENGO), for eco-collaboration
    activities in a structurally dynamic manner based on the NGO national context
    i.e., Thai, Lebanese, Australian (Aoun, Vatanasakdakul, & Bunker, 2011). – a combined
    open social media platform and proprietary job scheduling system to communicate
    with and organize a student volunteer army during the Christchurch Earthquakes
    (Bunker, Ehnis, Seltsikas, & Levine, 2013); and – an open social media platform
    for dynamic communication, coordination, and collaboration activities during Hurricane
    Harvey (2017) by emergency management agencies, media organizations, journalists,
    private individuals, celebrities, politicians, and influencers who took on the
    roles of information starters, information amplifiers and information transmitters
    (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020). These cases highlight an
    emerging need for development of effective complex information governance approaches
    for IS, using dynamic organizing principles. Lee, Zhu, and Jeffery (2019) researched
    information governance and data management for these types of platform ''ecosystems''.
    While they focussed on data governance and practices, they did not directly address
    the complexity of information governance where trusted situational awareness/consensus
    is developed at a societal level from a combination of formal and informal IS.
    In order to conceptualize and understand complex information governance for development
    of trusted situational awareness and response at scale, transitions may hold the
    key i.e. dynamic co-evolutionary processes that evolve from the "interplay of
    many unlike, particular processes" (Kemp, Parto, & Gibson, 2005, p. 23). Transitions
    present us with an opportunity to develop approaches for complex information governance
    as they are "aimed and guided in an iterative, forward-looking, adaptive manner,
    using markets, institutions and hierarchy (the three basic forms of coordination)"
    (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 23). These three forms of coordination are critical ''global
    levers'' for climate action so consensus regarding information governance at a
    transitional level is crucial for achievement of situational awareness, development
    of sustainability response/goals and resulting action. The key components or mechanisms
    of complex governance for social sustainability include: policy integration, common
    objectives, criteria, trade-off rules and indictors, information and incentives
    for practical implementation and programs for system innovation (Kemp et al.,
    2005). “The most significant challenge is to ensure that multi-player governance
    regimes embody capacity for sustainability-oriented co-ordination, direction and
    re-direction” (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 18). This can be achieved through the nature
    and dynamics of autopoiesis or self-producing/constructing physical systems (Bunker
    et al., 2013, Mingers, 2002, Mingers, 2004). These systems are: self-producing;
    contingently maintained (so that they don''t breakdown); structurally open but
    organizationally closed; structurally determined; able to be structurally coupled
    to other systems by mutual specification and/or co-evolution; and able to embrace
    embodied cognition and self-reference/recursion to enable self-construction/production
    (Mingers, 2002, p. 280). Transitional processes combined with the nature and dynamics
    of autopoietic systems, provide IS scholars with a theoretical basis for complex
    information governance development. The use of both formal organizational IS and
    informal personal/social IS in disaster management and crisis response, has been
    rapidly co-evolving at scale over the last decade (Ehnis & Bunker, 2020). While
    IS scholars have mainly focussed on information governance approaches for formal
    organizational IS, the self-producing/constructing attributes of hybrid IS which
    combine elements of the formal and informal have been largely ignored. The negative
    aspects of social systems and platforms and their combination/integration with
    formally managed and governed IS, have presented society with many problems (Elbanna,
    Dwivedi, Bunker, & Wastell, 2020). There is, however, potential for their management
    and use to effect positive outcomes for social sustainability and the response
    to the global climate crisis, if approaches to complex information governance
    are developed and implemented by IS scholars and practitioners. Currently there
    is a global focus on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
    (STEM) education, but more recently there have been calls for a reframing of STEM
    from techno-science, towards a science of reconnection with nature (Smith & Watson,
    2020). IS courses and training can therefore, make a valuable contribution to
    the development of complex information governance for social sustainability at
    scale by developing and delivering units of study that focus on: 1) complex information
    governance and leadership for social sustainability - frameworks, concepts, descriptions,
    rules and communications approaches based on transitions and autopoietic systems;
    2) how to work in large and diverse teams - understanding, implementing and accommodating
    approaches to complex information governance; 3) and understanding the information
    governance of global supply networks and logistics for sustainable development
    goals. 3.5.3. Contribution 21 – climate change – IT – Data Science perspective
    – Ms Jeel Dharmeshkumar Shah The world’s climatic conditions seem to deteriorate
    every day, and the evidence from the research(Shaftel, 2021) held at NASA further
    bolsters this claim. The researchers at NASA further believe that the unprecedented
    warming trends today are the effect of human actions. Since most of these actions
    involve the development or use of technology, it certainly plays a significant
    role in climate change. The world today seems to be in a state of quandary. Whether
    to restrict the use of technology or invest in further research in the same field
    is a concern. However, in this case, I believe that the cause is the solution-
    just like the snake venom that is fatal for humans but is also proven to be medicinal
    and used to save lives. When the problem is so complicated, the solution must
    also be four-fold; we must take the System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. We must
    be able to analyze the dependencies of various systems - such as human, environmental,
    physical and information systems- which the SoS framework can enable. This could
    be a holistic approach to finding possible solutions to this complicated issue
    as it provides a good understanding from all viewpoints. Data Science is a required
    field for this discussion as it can analyze all forms of data and help automate
    crucial decisions. ‘Green Technology’ is expected to transform our society. The
    Climate Group, in their report, estimates that smart technologies such as smart
    homes/buildings, smart transport and logistics, intelligent agriculture management
    systems and smart electricity grids are a few of the various ways that can help
    reduce greenhouse emissions. It is Data Science that makes these technologies’
    Smart’ or ‘Intelligent’. While Big Data provides a platform for processing large
    chunks of heterogeneous data, Data Analytics and AI help analyze this data and
    identify trends (with the help of machine learning to identify main features and
    make predictions). This intelligence is then used in business to make informed
    and calculated decisions. Cloud computing can further be used to accelerate the
    process, and IoT could help apply these efficiently in a practical scenario. Analyzing
    the foot-fall data of various public transport systems, for example, could help
    identify efficient routes, and this ‘Smart Transport System’ would then optimize
    its fuel consumption and aid in reducing carbon footprints. Another such example
    would be a ‘smart air conditioning system’ that collects, compares and analyses
    weather and usage data to develop plans that optimize economic and environmental
    savings—solutions such as these help tackle issues regarding the sustainability
    of the climate. Various techniques followed by the Data Scientist aid this kind
    of analysis. Classification is one such technique that draws meaningful information
    and differentiates the data based on similarities found in its attributes. Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) can also be utilized in many practical scenarios for cause
    and effect analysis. One such example is the study carried out in the United States
    that used this technique to identify the factors affected due to differences in
    hydro-climatology of two different streams. This study successfully inferred how
    the differences affected the average runoff, flow stability(from baseline) and
    frequency of floods in the two areas (Poff, Tokar, & Johnson, 1996). Further improvements
    in the climate model were also made in 2003 (Knutti, Stocker, Joos, & Plattner,
    2003) to increase its efficiency with larger datasets. Calculations from this
    model revealed that almost half the members surpassed the surface heating range
    that the IPCC estimated earlier. In such challenging scenarios, neural networks
    can help extensively. It is all used to explore the general trend in climate change
    and its mechanisms to identify the hidden correlation/attributes in the data that
    is otherwise not decipherable. The use of Solar energy has become increasingly
    popular today as it is a renewable source of energy. One of the major drawbacks
    of this form of energy is that its availability widely depends on meteorological
    conditions. The efficiency and performance of a solar power plant would depend
    on these changing conditions. Jang, Bae, Park, and Sung (2016) has discussed how
    we can leverage images captured by the satellite to train a SVM (Support Vector
    Machine) model and predict the motion of clouds. This could be a brilliant way
    to determine when the plant would be most productive and when it would require
    backup. In this way, data analytics could help manage climate changes for uninterrupted
    and effective energy production. Climate change also significantly affects coral
    reefs that are important for the ecosystem as they provide food and shelter for
    their inhabitants. Thermal stress due to the warming of the ocean could cause
    infectious diseases, while frequent intense storms could lead to the destruction
    of the reefs. A rise in sea levels could lead to sedimentation, whose runoff can
    destroy the corals, while fluctuations in precipitation lead to an increase in
    runoff that could make the water murky and restrict the light. One such study
    (Franco, Hepburn, Smith, Nimrod, & Tucker, 2016) conducted in 2016 used the Bayesian
    Network approach to evaluate how climate change disturbances affected the coral
    reefs. The study revealed interesting results identifying the factor that contributed
    the most to the carbonate budgetary state of the reef and concluded that the change
    in the state of the reef was mainly due to the decrease in water quality (Franco
    et al., 2016). Data Science offers a plethora of such techniques that can be applied
    in the majority of challenging scenarios. It can help in the acquisition of environmental
    data as well as monitoring and analyzing it. This can help take immediate actions
    in case of an emergency or check if an industry is compliant with the pollution
    control requirements. Remote sensing and continuous data monitoring improve data
    availability that is the foundation for Data analysis. Risk analysis is another
    critical feature that can be used in combination with IoT enabled devices to send
    real-time alerts in case of high-risk prediction. These alerts and controls maintain
    safety by keeping a check on potential hazards. Results drawn from such analysis
    could also aid in finding sustainable alternatives. These advantages are very
    beneficial for governance, and the government has collaborated with the IT industry
    in developing and launching schemes that help alleviate the environmental conditions.
    The ‘National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)’ was established in 2020 by the central
    government that is predicted to reduce 20–30% of particulate matter concentration
    in 4 years by 2024 (NCAP, 2020). Another such flagship scheme introduced by the
    government is the ‘Namami Gange Programme’ that aims to reduce water pollution,
    conserve effectively and revive river Ganga (Namami Gange Programme, 2020). With
    the enormous number of benefits and applications, Data Science, in my opinion,
    has not yet reached its full potential. This is because ‘Data’ forms the foundation
    of Data Science, and without accurate and complete data, ambitious goals can be
    challenging to achieve. A recent paper published on the 10th of October 2021 (Callaghan
    et al., 2021) successfully collected enough evidence to conclude- based on mapping
    of 10000 attributes- that almost 80% of the land area globally is affected by
    climate changes caused by human actions. This is an excellent insight although
    the researchers also identified the ‘attribution gap’. Though the paper could
    draw important information about global climate models, it failed to understand
    the impact of climate on low-income countries. This was because they were unable
    to collect enough data from these regions. Shruti Nath, a researcher at Climate
    Analytics, said, “Developing countries are at the forefront of climate impacts,
    but we can see in our study there are real blind spots when it comes to climate
    impact data. Most of the areas where we are not able to connect the dots attribution-wise
    are in Africa. This has real implications for adaptation planning and access to
    funding in these places” (Mercator, 2021). Although curation of data and its quality
    remains a problem, my belief in the potential of this field stays unaltered. Though
    there are many hurdles on the way, Data Scientists are working hard in fighting
    these challenges and coming up with new and improved solutions every day. 3.5.4.
    Contribution 22 – the IS/IT in addressing the challenges of climate change – Dr
    Matti Mäntymäki 3.5.4.1. Need of increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT Digital services, platforms, and infrastructures consume significant
    amounts of electricity globally. On the other hand, digital infrastructures consume
    electricity. From this vantage point, for example Bitcoin can hardly be considered
    an environmentally sustainable technology. Moreover, the upgrade from HD to 4–8 K
    quality in video has an effect on the energy consumption of the devices such as
    smartphones and tables used to watch the videos. Considering the global smartphone
    penetration, energy consumption of smartphones is a significant sustainability
    issue. All in all, this calls for increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT development and operations. This in turn requires that sustainability
    impact of digital services, platforms, and infrastructures be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion. 3.5.4.2. Reducing digital waste through
    IS/IT design As the volumes of data being created, transmitted, and stored have
    skyrocketed also the volumes of ’digital waste’, i.e. unused digital content,
    have surged. To provide some perspective of this phenomenon, CO2 emissions of
    YouTube in 2019 was evaluated to equal a city size of Glasgow.7 A well-known example
    of how IS/IT design could reduce CO2 emissions is not to show video for users
    who are only listening to audio. This idea of digital waste reduction videos could
    be taken a step further by default by asking the user if he/she wants to see the
    video in addition to the audio content. In addition, energy efficiency can be
    considered in website design. Typically, today’s websites are dynamic. While this
    design approach offers benefits in terms of user experience, it basically requires
    that the server hosting the website creates the website for the user. A static
    website that is stored on the server and updated on a 12-hour or 24-hour interval
    is considerably more power efficient. 3.5.4.3. Research-based decision-making
    to accelerate adoption of ‘green initiatives’ Resulting from the increased innovation
    around Greentech, there will be various new technological solutions to address
    the challenges of climate change. The effectiveness and impact of technological
    tools is dependent on their successful implementation as well as adoption and
    use by the users. The academic IS community has worked on technology adoption
    for decades and the individual-level technology adoption has evolved to be one
    of the most mature areas of academic IS research (Venkatesh, Davis, & Morris,
    2007). Hence, the IS community is well-equipped to contribute to the deployment
    of various technological solutions targeted to fight climate change. 3.5.4.4.
    Sharing economy and circular economy as a means towards more resource-effective
    societies The sharing economy is one way for existing resources to be used more
    efficiently (Sutherland & Jarrahi, 2018). Sharing economy at scale is typically
    executed through digital platforms. Digital platforms such as Uber are famous
    for leveraging data, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence to predict
    and balance supply and demand. Another mechanism toward a more resource-efficient
    society is the circular economy. It is evident that executing a circular economy
    requires implementation of digital infrastructures where the physical and digital
    elements go hand-in-hand (see Lee, 2008; Rajkumar, Lee, Sha, & Stankovic, 2010).
    3.5.5. Contribution 23 – the value of information management in the built environment
    to tackle climate change – Mr Henry Fenby-Taylor The built environment is made
    up of sectors that have an outsize responsibility when it comes to the future
    of our planet. It provides us with our economic infrastructure – power lines,
    roads, railways, utilities, as well as our social infrastructure of homes, schools,
    hospitals and so on. Yet it also contributes around 40% of the UK’s total carbon
    footprint, according to the UK Green Building Council. There is a real sense of
    urgency that this needs to change. Industry leaders are increasingly in consensus
    that they need to prioritize how they mitigate and adapt to climate change, as
    well as reduce emissions. 3.5.5.1. Unlocking the value of data Critical to tackling
    climate change in the built environment will be the use of Information Management.
    It is currently a vast, largely untapped resource that will be pivotal in transforming
    the decision making process. At its core, Information Management is about making
    efficient use of resources – it’s about transforming information about the lifecycle
    of built assets into actionable intelligence. Effective information management
    gathers information across the lifecycle of assets from design to creation to
    operation. At each of these stages, data is collected that informs better decision
    making, enabling reductions in waste, time and cost, more efficient use of resources,
    improved design and safety and increased infrastructure resilience – all essential
    for reducing carbon emissions from our built environment and serving those it
    was intended for. Although we have the technology to collect large amounts of
    data it needs to be structured, managed and shared in an effective way to make
    it valuable. The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), through the National
    Digital Twin programme (NDTp) is creating the Information Management Framework
    which is a collection of open, technical and non-technical standards, guidance
    and common resources to enable secure and resilient sharing of data across sector
    and organizational boundaries. There are already some excellent examples of successful
    green Information Management in practice. The Energy and Carbon Reporting Framework
    developed by the CDBB, WMEBoom and the Construction Innovation Hub defines when
    operational energy and emissions need to be analyzed and reported during the lifecycle
    of built assets. This tool is providing organizations like NHS Scotland and their
    supply chain the ability to effectively identify and therefore control the energy
    and carbon impact of their built assets. It also supports the Construction Leadership
    Council''s CO2nstructZero programme which sets out how the construction sector
    can meet the Net Zero challenge. 3.5.5.2. Sharing data to improve climate resilience
    The sharing of data is an important part of the process. At the NDTp, the Climate
    Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) provides a practical example of how connected
    data and greater access to the right information across organizational and sectoral
    boundaries can improve climate adaptation and resilience. Collaborating on CReDo
    are Anglian Water, BT and UK Power Networks who will use their asset and operations
    data as well as weather data on a secure, shared basis to inform an increased
    level of infrastructure resilience. CReDo will integrate data between energy,
    water and telecoms networks to improve climate resilience decision-making across
    infrastructure systems. 3.5.5.3. Fit for the future Although it is clear we should
    be pushing towards a green information economy, there remain hurdles - we need
    a workforce with the appropriate skills who can make it happen. Our work at the
    CDBB has a socio-technical focus and part of this is balancing the technology
    with the people aspect. That is why we commissioned a Skills and Competency Framework
    report, a joint collaboration between Mott MacDonald, Lane4 team and the Construction
    Innovation Hub, that sets out the key roles and skills needed. It is a very practical
    framework that allows organizations and individuals to assess their own needs
    and consider how to address them. 3.5.5.4. A shift in culture Data is no longer
    a commodity to be hoarded, but a resource to be shared. If industry and government
    are serious about tackling climate change there needs to be collaboration and
    there needs to be interoperability between information management systems, so
    that we use all the data we have in a relevant, impactful way. 3.5.6. Contribution
    24 – What can information technology and systems researchers and educators do
    to mitigate climate change? – Dr Wu He To respond to climate change, a significant
    threat to the United States and the world, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences,
    Engineering and Medicine has convened a committee of experts and published a report
    in 2021 to highlight the need for transforming the world''s energy system to one
    with net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2050 (NASEM, 2021). The report
    emphasizes the need to invest in new technology, expand innovation toolkits, and
    reduce the cost of existing technology in a socially just way. My Views on the
    above four questions: 3.5.6.1. Energy Use and Technology The information management,
    information technology, and information systems sectors highly depend on computers,
    sensors, and a wide variety of physical and electronic devices. However, the production
    and use of computers, sensors, storage devices, and other electronic devices require
    a tremendous amount of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and causing
    harm to the environment. For example, data centers consist of a large number of
    servers and computing resources interconnected by high-speed networks, which need
    to work nonstop 24 × 7. Data centers have to rely on cooling systems to ensure
    all those machines do not overheat. Such cooling systems consume a lot of energy.
    The United States Data Center Energy Usage Report (Shehabi et al., 2016) indicates
    that data centers in the U.S. alone likely consumed approximately 73 billion kWh
    in 2020. Energy efficiency strategies and technologies, including AI and data
    analytics, could help monitor data centers’ energy usage and significantly improve
    energy conservation to reduce cost and carbon emissions. Google has reported using
    AI to reduce energy consumption in its data centers by as much as 40% (Evans &
    Gao, 2016). 3.5.6.2. Potential of information technology on mitigation of climate
    change Information technology has great potential to increase the energy efficiency
    of buildings, transportation systems, manufacturing, supply chains, power grids,
    infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling sustainable solutions for energy consumption
    and usage. Low-cost internet of things (IoT) sensors and devices (e.g., smart
    thermostats, smart humidifiers, smart air purifier, smart air conditioner, smart
    fans, smart blinds, and so on) have been used to reduce energy consumption and
    achieve long term cost savings by tailoring climate-control according to real-time
    needs and lifestyle of people and their schedule (either in the building or away).
    Teleconferencing, telemedicine, e-commerce, and e-learning technologies are playing
    a role in reducing unnecessary travel and thus reducing total emissions into the
    environment. These sensor-based technologies can continuously collect massive
    amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and other relevant parameters
    and adjust based on optimal standards or human preferences and needs. Big data
    analysis and visualization can be leveraged to unlock insights that will help
    individuals, organizations and communities track electricity consumption patterns,
    identify energy leaks, improve energy use efficiency, and find creative ways to
    conserve energy and adapt to climate change faster and better. 3.5.6.3. Suggested
    research agenda on climate change Several potential research ideas on climate
    change for information management, information systems, and technology researchers
    are listed below: • Conducting empirical research to collect first-hand evidence
    and develop evidence-based guidelines and suggestions to help practitioners design
    and implement Green IT(green information technology) and Green IS (green information
    systems) initiatives within their organization. Green IS (green information systems)
    refers to the use of information systems to achieve environmental objectives.
    In contrast, Green IT (green information technology) refers to the practice of
    environmentally sustainable computing and emphasizes reducing the environmental
    impacts of IT production and use (Dedrick, 2010). Green IT/IS can help reduce
    the negative consequences of technology production on the environment and contribute
    to sustainable solutions, including environmentally sustainable business processes,
    practices, and end products in organizations and communities (Boudreau, Chen,
    & Huber, 2008). • Studying the adoption of energy-saving IT in locations like
    home, businesses and communities, and assessing the impacts of information technology
    innovations on human behavior, mitigation of climate change, and relevant policymaking.
    • Conducting design-based research on designing and developing AI-based techniques,
    modeling and simulation, decision support tools, games, visualization, and other
    technologies or approaches that help the general public visualize and understand
    possible impacts of climate change. • Studying the use of games, mobile apps,
    augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality and other technology innovations
    in promoting environmentally sustainable behavior that contributes to climate
    change mitigation. Such studies could help understand the role of human behavior
    in achieving climate change mitigation strategies, reveal insights why people
    choose to engage in specific environmentally sustainable behavior or not, develop
    innovative approaches, policies, best practices, and solutions to climate change
    (Douglas & Brauer, 2021). 3.5.6.4. IT/IS education on climate change This generation
    and future generations need to understand the impacts of climate change on our
    daily lives and society. IT/IS education could play a critical role in helping
    individuals and communities in the understanding of the science behind climate
    change and what steps are needed to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming caused by climate change and human activity. IS/IT educators could use
    project-based or problem-based learning approaches to engage students to explore
    specific climate change issues and community-related climate datasets (e.g., heat,
    cold, rain, drought, snow, wind, river, lake, ocean, water quality, air quality,
    and coastal flooding) and to assess the impact of potential solutions by leverage
    existing software, tools and techniques such as data analysis and visualization,
    modeling and simulation, augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality, and
    AI techniques. When students are asked to use technology tools to explore specific
    climate change issues and datasets of interest or relevance to their local communities,
    they are more likely to become interested and engage in active learning for systems
    thinking, complex problem-solving, creativity, and evidence-informed decision-making.
    In the meantime, they will become familiar with these software, tools, and techniques
    through learning by using them to analyze data and solve problems in a meaningful
    way. Students will have a chance to develop interdisciplinary skills to interpret
    complex data analysis and visualization results into informed decisions and sound
    policies. The ability and skills to interpret data and communicate results to
    support the decision-making process are important for IT/IS students to become
    effective decision makers or problem-solvers in their careers. IS/IT educators
    are recommended to come up with concrete learning activities, to develop technology-related
    case studies, tutorials, projects, and exercises on the topic of climate change,
    and to encourage their students to work on collaborative or hands-on projects
    using open-source resources, including various datasets and open-source software
    and tools available on the Internet, such as CODAP, R, Python, and more. There
    exists significant levels of climate change, open-source projects on GitHub, which
    is an excellent way for IT/IS students to learn, practice, and contribute. 3.6.
    Technology and IS research agenda 3.6.1. Contribution 25 – holistically missing:
    climate change and information systems research – Professor Samuli Pekkola 3.6.1.1.
    Introduction and related activities In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and
    Communications recently published a climate and environmental strategy for the
    information and communication technology sector (Ojala & Oksanen, 2021). The strategy
    defines ICT related objectives and measures for carbon-neutral Finland, paying
    attention to ICT infrastructures and their energy efficiency, making recommendations
    on energy aspects in software and service procurement, considering material flows
    and recycling of the devices, suggesting energy consumption statistics on data
    centers, and increasing awareness of energy specific issues of software and hardware.
    These areas and objectives, and their measures are evidently impactful on climate
    change. They increase awareness and provide general goals. Unfortunately, the
    strategy pays no attention to how the use of ICT impacts on climate and environment.
    The use aspect is touched, for example, in the European Commission’s ICT for Sustainable
    Growth (2021) program, where, similarly to Estonia (2018), UK (Howes, 2020), and
    Norway (2016), the point of foci is on sustainable economics, not on sustainable
    ecology, environment, green ICT, or climate change – whatever term is adopted.
    This means that, in practice, environmental issues and ICT are approached either
    sporadically with a narrow view and disconnected contexts, or indirectly in the
    context of economic growth and prosperity. Similarly, IT/IS literature sees environmental
    issues as something that the ICT managers should consider in their work. For example,
    Esfahani, Rahman, and Zakaria (2015) and Singh and Sahu (2020) summarized the
    green IS studies focusing on the benefits, adoption, design and implementation,
    or initiation of green IS projects. Loeser (2013) takes a more concrete approach
    and lists a variety of different contexts for green IS initiatives. Wang X. (2015),
    Wang Y. (2015)’s meritorious literature review parallels these and poses a set
    of research questions, all aiming to understand the green IS initiatives. In general,
    it seems that IS literature focuses the adoption of ideas of climate change into
    the IS activities and context. Comprehensive understanding about how to apply
    and use IT/IS to improve the situation regarding climate change seem to be scarce.
    3.6.1.2. Towards a holistic understanding of IS and climate change The absence
    of comprehensive approaches is surprising especially after the lessons from COVID-19.
    For example, the amount of traveling decreased up to 90% in California due to
    stay-at-home orders (Schilling 2020). At the same time, air quality improved significantly
    (Eregowda, Chatterjee, & Pawar, 2021). People have learned new ways of working,
    learning, and living, without a need to travel to work, school, or anywhere. Although
    these settings of distant working, online learning, and online shopping, traveling,
    and leisure have been studied (c.f. Dwivedi et al., 2020; Pan & Zhang, 2020),
    the approach is again contextual: how to use IS in online meetings or education,
    how to provide or acquire goods, food, or services online, and how to manage and
    govern the IT (Herath & Herath, 2020). Contextual approach becomes problematic
    with the interconnectivity of systems and the systems of systems. For example
    during the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning tools have turned out to be quite
    efficient in conveying learning contexts to distant learners, although some learning-related
    difficulties have been identified (Chen and Roldan, 2021, Xie et al., 2020). Yet
    the difficulties may go beyond the learning contexts. Online activities have been
    reported to increase loneliness, disconnectivity with fellow students and teachers,
    distraction, mental problems, and increased workload (Maqableh and Alia, 2021,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). These negative issues may have unpredictably long-lasting
    effects on learners: for instance, do they know the topics, have they made friends,
    and have they learned to interact in face-to-face situations? The quality of an
    online learning environment may have an impact on the rest of the learner’ life.
    Similarly, targeting green IS/IT activities locally may, or may not, be beneficial
    from the viewpoint of climate change. They may have unintended consequences similarly
    to online learning: activities seemingly beneficial in the short term may possibly
    be harmful in the long run. This notion leads to following research topics: •
    What are the long-term effects of green ICT investments? To climate and environment?
    To people: employees, learners, travelers, and their ways of doing, working, and
    living? To institutions? To firms and other organizations? To other parts of the
    system? • When do the benefits of green ICT investments exceed its investment
    costs? The example of an electric car illustrates this: building an electric car
    is more environmentally harmful than building a petrol car, but the tide turns
    when the car is used enough. What is this turning point for a green IT/IS investment?
    And most importantly: • How can ICT be used to improve the situation regarding
    climate change? Interestingly, we are studying how the ideas and isms of climate
    change and green ICT are adopted, but not how ICT should be used to reduce climate
    change. This has been touched by sustainable economic endeavors, but aren’t there
    any other values in addition to economic issues? 3.6.2. Contribution 26 – information
    technology and climate change – Professor Rameshwar Dubey Irresponsible human
    activities are well reflected in the form of rising sea levels, forest fires,
    extinction of some rare species, the meteoric rise in floods in many parts of
    the world, and fast-shrinking levels of safe drinking water. These are clear indications
    that human influence on climate systems is clear and growing (Wright & Nyberg,
    2017). Whyte (2020) argues that it is now too late to avoid dangerous climate
    change. The negative effects of climate change have attracted significant attention
    from the world''s top leaders, industry, media, and policymakers (Banerjee, 2001,
    Kolk and Pinkse, 2008, Mees et al., 2019). Some scholars argue that “climate change
    threatens irreversible and dangerous impacts,” that may have serious negative
    effects on people and ecosystems (Whyte, 2020), and to address the pressing global
    threat, there exists a unanimous call for an immediate reduction in carbon emission
    levels (Park, Byun, Deo, & Lee, 2015). Although the COVID-19 crisis has caused
    severe discomfort and impacted human lives in significant ways, studies have identified
    signs of some positive and visible regional effects on the planet (Khan, Shah,
    & Shah, 2021). This could be easily explained by a change in behaviors during
    lockdown that has reduced human activities such as transportation, irresponsible
    consumption, production, and industrial activities. In the last two years, there
    is some evidence of an improvement in the quality of air, water and the environment
    looks greener and cleaner than it used to be (Everard et al., 2021). This change
    has been possible due to the role of emerging technologies, (Dwivedi et al., 2020,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). Many scholars have found positive effects from emerging
    technologies on environmental sustainability: big data and predictive analytics
    capability (Dubey et al., 2019), blockchain technology (Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis,
    & Shen, 2019), AI (Nishant et al., 2020), and cloud computing enabled supply chain
    design (Shee, Miah, Fairfield, & Pujawan, 2018). However, the COVID-19 crisis
    has further accelerated the debate on “how information technology capabilities
    or information management scholars” can help tackle climate change (He, Zhang,
    & Li, 2021). Despite the general optimism in the role of environmentally friendly
    technologies or emerging technologies in tackling climate challenges, some developed
    and developing economies, industry and global corporations still remain skeptical
    about the role of information technology in tackling the climate change crisis
    (Teräväinen et al., 2014). Wright and Nyberg (2017) argue that the organizations
    in pursuit of their economic gains have in the past lobbied against carbon emissions
    initiatives and further delayed constructive action. Despite the rich body of
    literature on the corporation''s initiative towards mitigating the carbon emissions
    problem (Banerjee, 2001, Wright and Nyberg, 2017), organizational/ management/
    information technology scholars have an important role to play particularly in
    addressing the climate change crisis. There is a need for theory-driven research
    that provides an in-depth understanding of both the causes and possible solutions
    to tackle climate change. We note some clear research gaps in the academic literature
    and posit the following research questions that may help bridge the gaps in our
    understanding and the expected role of the information technology /emerging technologies
    in tackling the climate change crisis: a. How AI-enabled predictive analytics
    techniques may help identify some of the economic activities in some parts of
    the world which are contributing to carbon emissions? b. How the use of distributed
    ledger technology (DLT) and AI can help identify the role of some corporations
    involved in unethical practices that led to contamination of water bodies and
    deforestation? c. How the use of AI enables predictive analytics to detect issues
    during logistics and transportation within developing economies thereby contributing
    to a reduction in carbon emissions? d. How AI-enabled technologies can help build
    swift trust and collaboration among the stakeholders engaged in tackling the climate
    change crises? 3.6.3. Contribution 27 – blockchain and climate change – Dr Daniela
    Andreini Of all technologies in place in the market, the one I know best is the
    blockchain. This technology has environmental, social and economic impacts, and
    in these few words, I would like to focus on the ecological aspects. 3.6.3.1.
    How IM/IT/IS sector has any negative impact on the environment and how it can
    be reduced Like any other technology, blockchain creates a digital ecosystem composed
    of multiple hardware devices, program files, and different actors'' data files.
    Another critical component of the ecosystem is interacting and exchanging cryptocurrencies,
    files, information, etc. The sustainability of the blockchain is controversial;
    for instance, O''Dwyer and Malone (2014) stated that the energy consumption of
    the Bitcoin mining network is comparable with the Ireland electricity consumption.
    In the same way, we can think about the energy and infrastructural consumption
    of all the IM/IT/IS systems that cause enormous energy and infrastructural consumption
    and thus a tremendous environmental impact. 3.6.3.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized
    to improve situation regarding climate change At the same time, other authors
    demonstrated that the artificial intelligence and IT ecosystem could find more
    efficient ways to create and exchange information and virtual services. For instance,
    for what concerns bitcoins, Dimitriou and Karame (2013) demonstrated that in mining
    bitcoins, if a miner can create a block more efficiently and speedily than another
    one, the system will substitute the less efficient miner with the most productive
    and profitable one. This mechanism drives the entire system towards a more effective
    way to use and consume energy and infrastructures. Thus, the IM/IT/IS systems
    can be the sources and the solution of energy consumption and dispersion. 3.6.3.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change The
    cost and climate impact of blockchain are strictly related to its diffusion. For
    instance, in this historical moment, the substitution of traditional currencies
    with bitcoins in our monetary system would be too expensive in energy consumption,
    and thus it could not be sustainable. Therefore, in finance, for instance, more
    research is needed to understand how the two monetary systems can coexist efficiently.
    The same thing can be extended to other IM/IT/IS systems: virtualized and physical
    transactions should coexist to balance environmental, social, and economic systems.
    3.6.3.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Experimentation in education
    is relevant, and more educational systems should turn into laboratories, where
    institutions should offer problem-solving driven teaching methods. 3.6.4. Contribution
    28 – towards a relevant agenda for environmental issues within KM/IM/IS/IT – Professor
    Johan Olaisen The climate crisis is the largest threat to civilization we have
    ever faced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018
    made the science very clear. There are significant climate impacts all around
    the world even if we limit warming to the recommended 1.5 C. The report also showed
    there are significant increases in impacts and damages between 1.5 and 2.0 C.
    These results were fully supported by the IPCC science report (2021). We are building
    our living standards upon coal, gas, and oil, and few of us want to change our
    lives, and new global generations are coming that want our living standards. Every
    corporation wants to be green and practice sustainability even if the reality
    of the image is most often an illusion or just a fashion (Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbd). What is the research situation within knowledge management
    (KM), information management (IM), information technology (IT) and information
    system (IS) research? We investigated all academic papers 2016–2020 (N = 481)
    delivered at the European Conference for Knowledge Management (ECKM). We found
    that less than 5% of the papers investigated climate issues and concluded that
    the KM/IM/IT/IS potentially harms environmental-climate issues owing to neglect
    (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd). All research consists of problem, knowledge,
    and methodology sentences. We get traditional pragmatic business-as-usual research
    when there is an over-focus upon methodology and knowledge sentences and a low
    focus upon problems. We must start to ask the research questions about environmental
    and sustainability issues. Through verification and falsification (Popper, 1974),
    research is expected to come up with theories, paradigms, perspectives (Kuhn,
    1962) that explains and explores practices that we may evaluate, giving us either
    empirical research or critical research (what is acceptable/not acceptable) or
    constructed research (what is adequate and what is not adequate). Most research
    is empirical, and to get more focus upon environmental issues, we must get more
    constructed and critical research setting up the green and sustainable agenda.
    We must ask the essential questions about if the academic papers involve acceptable
    or not acceptable climate solutions or if the papers are adequate or not adequate
    for relevant climate issues. Fig. 3 presents the model of the climate crisis issues

    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Towards an agenda for handling the climate
    crisis in information research. Research deals with four paradigms: the empirical,
    the materialistic (political), clarified subjectivity, and action papers. Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb found that nearly all papers
    might be classified as empirical and as a form of clarified subjectivity papers
    in harmony with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. We must invite
    papers in conflict with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. These papers
    will be representing the materialistic political and action paradigms. We must
    ask how research papers, often in conflict, contribute to climate issues. To get
    green and sustainable papers, we must get more problem-focused research on climate
    issues, more critical and constructed papers, more exploring papers built upon
    sensitizing concepts and less upon definitive concepts, and more political and
    action-based papers. Most of all, we need editors and conference chairs dedicated
    to climate issues asking for adequate and critical papers on this topic that might
    be political, action-based, and problems often based in conflict with existing
    issues, knowledge, and methodology. A political economy paradigm for the climate
    crisis in information research is a complement to presently prevailing concepts.
    KM/IM/IS/IT research and papers might be utilized to be a knowledge café, outlet,
    and center for environmental issues and perspectives. We might develop an environmental
    paradigm for relevant KM/IM/IS/IT research. We might define another future for
    societies and organizations. We might be giving the picture of a pluralistic sustainable
    future and even a utopia (More, 1973). We already have the experience through
    AI and robotics forming the fourth industrial revolution and solving the environmental
    issues is the fifth industrial revolution based upon the perspectives from KM/IM/IS/IT
    research. The paradigms within information research focusing upon the climate

    use in the climate crisis. The objective and agenda of IS/I/IT/KM research strategy
    for sustainability are to help to promote knowledge, information, systems, and
    technology that will: • Resolve national and global challenges relating to sustainability
    in corporations and societies • Facilitate industrial development that enhances
    sustainability and increases green competitiveness • Promote the innovativeness
    and creativity for sustainable solutions • Such objectives will include areas
    like: • Reduced climate change and effective adaptation measures • Preservation
    of ecosystems services and lower environmental impacts • Sustainable cities, corporations,
    regions, and transport systems • The circular knowledge economy The IPCC, 2018,
    IPCC, 2021 have mentioned five areas: Food and ecology, Sustainable cities, Energy
    and material, Health and wellbeing, Transportation. IT/IS/IM/KM are mentioned
    as essential for all these areas, and there is a need for developing the areas
    into issues for journals and conferences. The identified focus for research within
    information research is in Scandinavia sustainable private and public cases where
    the green and sustainable practices are documented. These cases should be developed
    into model cases for KM/IM/IS/IT. The cases should be used as action research
    cases promoting a sustainable practise (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).
    The Scandinavian impact model might look like Fig. 5: Download : Download high-res
    image (118KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The Scandinavian impact
    model of information research. An important issue is how KM/IM/S/IT in higher
    education should reflect the environmental issues. Education that ensures future
    competencies upon sustainability, reuse, and environmental issues is essential.
    Environmental, green, and sustainable practices are an essential part of green
    education. Green KM/IT/IM/IS practice in action will be significant to get the
    students to participate in the transformational changes. The students must understand
    how different practices influence the environment. I have developed an executive
    program at BI (Oslo) “Sustainable leadership-in-action," where sustainable practices
    are discussed and reflected upon through collaboration with Norwegian businesses
    and the participants'' experiences and where the students project paper is an
    empirical paper reflecting and learning from green practices with a synopsis as
    a reflection upon how they have implemented sustainable practices in their organizations.
    Ideally, should environmental issues be a part of all programs. KM/IM/IS/IT are
    innovative and creative tools for the solutions to environmental issues. Let COP26
    also be the starting line for new objectives, areas, and education within KM/IM/IS/IT.
    We have every tool we need within information research to help to reduce and tackle
    the climate crisis. Let us all contribute!. 4. A brief overview of full opinion

    Ågerfalk et al. (2022), explores the Scandinavian perspectives on three current
    research projects where digital transformation is posited as offering a positive
    force in the fight against climate change and its impact on the world. The research
    viewed the climate change challenges from a stakeholder-centric perspective, emphasizing
    the criticality of closely involving people to engender the necessary change required
    in the design of digital technologies and the requirement for green IS researchers
    to engage in a collaborative context. It is vital that emerging technology focussed
    solutions, designed to combat climate change, take account of the necessary ethical
    dimensions and values from the onset to negate the potential scenario of technological
    innovations exacerbating the climate change problem. These aspects are analyzed
    by Brooks et al. (2022) where the opinion article highlights the importance of
    technologies delivering the required socio-economic impact through climate engineering
    solutions. Via a review of the relevant literature, the research reveals the disjointed
    nature of ethical dimensions in many cases, lagging behind emerging technological
    innovations. The study advocates a rebalancing of emphasis where ethical dimensions
    are an integral element of the climate engineering process. The opinion article
    by Laukkanen et al. (2022) argues for the usefulness of virtual technologies for
    changing human consumption behavior toward more sustainable consumption behaviors.
    The article argues that such technologies could provide greater opportunities
    to influence consumer decisions than the present digital environment. The article
    details a discussion on technology-assisted sensory marketing, cognitive and emotive
    aspects of virtual reality, and outlines applications of virtual reality technologies
    to encourage sustainable consumption. The opinion article led by Papadopoulos
    and Balta (2022), highlights the low levels of existing studies that focus on
    the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and impact of climate change, positing the
    potential opportunities for more sustainable operations and supply chains. The
    study assesses the challenges faced by operations and supply chains, asserting
    the contribution from BDA in providing a valuable role in the development of solutions
    to the myriad of climate related problems. Environmental sustainability from a
    technology acceptance perspective, is discussed in Papagiannidis and Marikyan
    (2022), where the opinion article highlights the dichotomy of technology negatively
    impacting the environment, whilst helping to manage and save precious natural
    resources. The research offers insights to the technology acceptance process from
    the sustainability perspective, arguing for a change in approach from researchers
    to be more cognisant of the impact of systems on the environment, thereby engendering
    environmentally compliant behaviors. Researchers have highlighted the valuable
    role of smart and climate intelligent cities in the transition from current high
    emission urban infrastructure. The opinion article by Pee and Pan (2022) calls
    for resilient urbanization to weather the impending climate shocks that are likely
    to materialize as a direct result of global warming. The research posits the role
    of IS research and its potential contribution to energy and resource optimization
    and the role of IS in the contribution to mitigating many of the current climate
    change related challenges. The opinion article by Pan et al. (2022) offers an
    Australia focussed perspective to approaching the climate change crisis highlighting
    the role of innovative technologies with huge transformative potential such as
    AI, analytics and IoT to tackle global warming whilst adhering to sustainable
    development goals. The researchers posit a research agenda that focuses on: climate
    resilience, climate-conscious citizen science, and substantive ESG strategies
    that can positively impact global warming. The key challenges related to redesigning
    the necessary human processes to eliminate environmentally harmful activities,
    while maintaining humans’ fundamental value proposition are discussed in the opinion
    article by Trkman and Černe (2022). The opinion article discusses a future world
    where humans transition from digitalization to a human digitalization, recognizing
    the critical role of government and research institutions for this change. The
    researchers highlight the role that technology can have in identifying, planning,
    enabling and executing the required changes in human behavior, as well as measuring
    and communicating their impact. 5. Discussion and recommendations This section
    elaborates on the expert contributions presented in Section 3, to reveal the key
    emphasis and emerging themes relating to digital technology, IS and climate change.
    We highlight the implications for government and society, and develop a number
    of key recommendations for policy, practice and education. 5.1. Expert Contribution

    inputs. 5.2. Emerging Issues and recommended actions Whilst the views on the extent
    of the role of digital technology and IS in combating climate change vary amongst
    the contributors, there is general consensus that technology is an integral component
    of the overall solution, whilst at the same time - a fundamental aspect of the
    problem (Muregesan, 2008; Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). There exists a realization
    amongst many of the contributors that a more sustainable implementation of technology
    in all its forms, needs to be at the forefront of solutions to get to net zero,
    the mistakes of old cannot be repeated once more. A number of the submitted articles
    reference the negative impact of human behavior and people''s attitudes in their
    day to day use of technology, positing the necessity for a transformative change
    in the way technology is developed, used and recycled. The expert input by Professor
    Davison illustrates these points specifically, highlighting the study by Clarke
    and Davison (2020), where the study asserts that very few studies within the IS
    research discourse, viewed the major challenges from the environmental perspective
    or included the environment as a key stakeholder. Professors Constantiou and Vendelø
    develop a narrative that highlights the potential use of technological solutions
    to facilitate the necessary change in human behaviors, citing how technology could
    be used to: identifying climate impact of transportation options, reduction in
    food waste via collaborative consumption and education on sustainable cooking.
    Behavioral influences from the community perspective in the context of faith and
    youth activism, are discussed in the expert inputs by Dr Abumoghli and Professor
    Panteli respectively, highlighting the important role of technology in building
    active communities that challenge the status quo. The expert input from Professor
    Metri cites the study by Junior et al. (2018) to highlight the woeful record of
    environmental sustainability from the technology industry, where the article posits
    the necessity of embedding the UN SDGs within technology design considerations
    and the potential of penalties for organizations that fail to change behaviors.
    The educational awareness and requirements for changed working practices, are
    discussed within a number of submitted articles, where these aspects are viewed
    from the technological perspective and impact on progress to net zero. The expert
    inputs from Professor Barlette and Drs Nishant and Teo identify the need for the
    IS community to educate more effectively to instil a greater awareness of the
    impact from technology adoption and the delicate balance between benefits toward
    net zero and contributing to the problem. The impact of climate change can be
    effectively monitored via the use of technology leading to a greater awareness
    amongst people to change their behaviors. These points are discussed in the expert
    input from Professor Tiwari where the article asserts the benefits of education
    at a community level, to empower people to gain access to knowledge and relevant
    data and assist vulnerable populations in the fight against climate change. The
    manufacture of technology based products relies on the use of precious and finite
    natural resources, at significant cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The
    expert inputs by Professors Rowe, Raman and Rana illustrate some of the negative
    impacts on the environment from the use of technology and the necessity for organizations
    to change their working practices to be more cognisant of the impact from the
    choices we make, the effect on the planet and support for the transition to environmentally
    friendly products. Professor Rana further emphasizes the need for education not
    just on climate change but also on how to use technology in a responsible way
    to help reduce carbon emissions and become ambassadors for sustainable living.
    The expert inputs by Professor Michael and Dr Abbas discuss the importance of
    a transition from current IS design practices to a more sustainability focussed
    approach and framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015), presenting a socio-technical sustainable
    design cycle for responsible systems design. A number of the expert contributions
    discussed perspectives relating to the impact of people and communities, where
    key aspects of technology can be used to ensure humans live and work with a “lighter
    touch” to conserve precious resources and attain net zero via the innovative use
    of IS infrastructure (Elbanna at a., 2020). The expert input by Professor Kodama
    references the increasing focus on smart communities in the form of smart cities
    where next generation social systems connect homes, buildings and transport, within
    an environmentally supportive infrastructure, highlighting the criticality of
    an emphasis based on IT collaboration to deliver meaningful change. The smart
    city contribution to reduced emissions is discussed by Professor Scholtz, where
    the contribution highlights the smart environment dimensions of smart cities (Van
    der Hoogen et al., 2020), and the necessity for addressing the necessary skills
    and educational requirements to ensure people can interact with smart infrastructure,
    thereby attaining the intended benefits and sustainable outcomes. The expert input
    from Professor De’ discussed the issues surrounding Green IS initiatives (Dedrick,
    2010; Khuntia et al., 2018; Melville, 2010), and how digital technologies can
    counter the effects of climate change. The article highlights the need for a greater
    emphasis on gender rebalancing to counter the poor access to technology from women
    in developing nations and the disproportionate effect that environmental change
    has on women. Studies have posited the need for a greater focus on responsible
    digitization and corporate digital responsibility (Crawford, 2021; Lobschat et
    al., 2021). These aspects are discussed in the expert inputs from Professor Wade
    and also Professor Sarker where both articulate the need for organizations and
    consumers to take a more holistic view on the use of technology across the full
    lifecycle, highlighting the need for a more balanced, realistic and wider debate
    on environmental tradeoffs. The article by Professor Sein and Dr Chandra Kruse
    advocates a Design Science Research (DSR) approach from the IS community when
    developing sustainability and global warming solutions. This approach aims to
    create new knowledge through building methods and artifacts that are aligned with
    improving societal problems via the greater adoption of green practices. The literature
    has posited the role of technology in the monitoring and governance of climate
    change progression, via the extensive use of IS systems and remote sensing devices
    to provide the necessary data to scientists and decision makers at a global level
    (Bunker, 2020, Nüttgens et al., 2011). The expert input by Dr Mäntymäki highlights
    the need for a greater awareness of the sustainability impact of digital services,
    platforms, and infrastructure and that these systems be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion to mitigate the surge in unused digital
    content - so called digital waste. The expert inputs from Professor Gupta, Professor
    Bunker and from Mr Fenby-Taylor elaborate on these crucial aspects where they
    posit the benefits of improved data innovation practice, transitional approaches
    to complex information governance and effective information management to engender
    a culture shift in the use of data in all its forms, more collaboratively, thereby
    delivering impactful change. The expert input by Ms Shah highlights the critical
    role of data science processes to inform decision makers, monitoring of potential
    environmental hazards and accurate modeling of global warming scenarios. In the
    contribution from Dr He, he discussed the role of data analysis and climate change,
    where the role of sensor-based technologies was highlighted in the collection
    of huge amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and develop insights
    to conserve and improve energy use. A number of the submitted expert inputs discussed
    topics associated with IS and digital technology research, commenting on the current
    position and potential agendas for the future. The expert input from Professor
    Pekkola criticised the narrow approach taken by organizations and public bodies
    where environmental issues and ICT are approached from disparate perspectives
    in the context of economic growth and prosperity. The article from Professor Dubey
    posits the need for theory-driven research utilizing AI based approaches to provide
    a better understanding of the causes of climate change and potential solutions.
    The impact of blockchain technology and the environment was discussed in the submission
    from Dr Andreini, where the article asserts the need for a research agenda better
    aligned to understanding how the traditional and cryptocurrencies can coexist
    more effectively. The article from Professor Olaisen critiqued the current IS
    literature, finding that a very small percentage of studies actually investigated
    climate issues, asserting the need for researchers to start to ask the necessary
    research questions, on key aspects of the environmental and sustainability issues.
    5.3. Recommendations for research The expert contributions detail a number of
    research recommendations on many aspects of technology and digital products. One
    of the key emerging themes from the contributions is the call to explicitly include
    the environment as a key stakeholder. This is referenced in the expert inputs
    by Professors Davison and Sarker and implicitly supported in many other contributions,
    where a more honest and informed perspective is required, advocating a research
    agenda that focuses on impacts as well as benefits from a responsible IS perspective.
    Many of the contributions highlight the need for further research on the role
    of IS in improving systems and processes in the transportation, agriculture and
    manufacturing industries to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and deliver
    accurate data to make better, more informed decisions. A number of contributions
    detail the critical role of IS and digital technologies in the provision of key
    data that can inform decision makers on the progress of global warming initiatives.
    Some of the topics discussed within the expert input by Professor Raman articulate
    many of the perspectives on this topic, highlighting the need for more research
    to improve the collection and dissemination of data on climate risk and use of
    sensor based IoT technologies within developing countries to alert authorities
    on emission levels. The expert input from Professor Rana supports a greater level
    of research focus on the socio-psychological behavioral factors surrounding the
    adoption of digital technologies, that can help inform researchers on how people
    adapt to new interactions and systems that reduce emissions. The theme of multidisciplinary
    perspectives on IS and sustainability for research agenda, is discussed by a number
    of experts including the need for greater focus on global IT collaboration. Viewing
    these perspectives from a transdisciplinary lens is advocated in the contribution
    from Professor Michael and Dr Abbas, where they posit the benefits of creating
    models and simulations within an overall sustainability framework that can encapsulate
    multi-level perspectives on the provision of data and technology interaction.
    A number of articles have referenced the role of smart technologies, smart cities
    and smart mobility, within the overall transition to a more sustainable digital
    infrastructure where people can interact with IS more effectively throughout their
    daily lives. However, as highlighted by Professor Scholtz, the focus on aligning
    smart initiatives to the UN SDGs seems to be an underdeveloped research area that
    could inform further research on key topics of sustainable water management, sanitation
    and access to sustainable energy sources. This sentiment is further explored in
    a number of articles, but particularly the call for greater multidisciplinary
    perspectives on CDR as highlighted by Professor Wade, asserting the need for a
    better understanding of the dynamics of CDR from theoretical and empirical perspectives.
    The problem of e-waste is discussed within a number of articles and further research
    in this area is explicitly called for. The article from Professor Gupta discusses
    a number of these key points that are detailed within many expert inputs, calling
    for greater research on improved strategies for dealing with this problem that
    negates the need for shifting the problem to emerging economies. The pivotal role
    of data and data science has been referenced in many submissions but particularly
    in the from Ms Shah where the article discusses the criticality of accurate data
    and empirical studies to inform key decision makers. Further research and insight
    is needed, through evidence-based initiatives to ensure the effects of global
    warming are effectively communicated to governments and organizations to ensure
    timely decisions are made and relevant resources are made available in the critical
    areas. 5.4. Recommendations for education The need for a greater educational awareness
    amongst IS researchers and users, seems to be a common thread within the submitted
    articles. A number of articles advocate a more holistic emphasis and informed
    debate on the environmental impact of technology, as well as its benefits in helping
    to mitigate further global warming and attainment of net zero by 2050. Many of
    the experts advocate a more balanced perspective within the IS and technology
    curriculum, to ensure students better understand the impact of behaviors. A number
    of articles also posit the need for better education on technologies that directly
    mitigate climate change, highlighting that this core topic seems to lack focus
    within many institutions. Technology has a critical role to play in the changing
    of human attitudes and behaviors toward sustainability. IS can educate and inform
    people about the carbon footprint to explore new innovative ways to perform everyday
    activities but in a more sustainable way. The article by Professors Constantiou
    and Vendelø illustrates how digital platforms can engender collaborative consumption
    and social entrepreneurship, educating people to redistribute unwanted products
    and reduce waste as well as influence consumers via sustainable cooking and plant
    based food. A number of experts have detailed the role of IS in the context of
    educating people through online communities. The contribution from Professor Panteli
    emphasizes this aspect, positing the role of young people and their digital activism
    in influencing a change in behaviors, whilst Dr Nishant and Professor Teo discuss
    the need for IS educators to increase awareness on green IS and the sustainability
    aspects of technology. It is clear from the submitted articles that education
    is a key component of the transition to net zero and ensuring that all stakeholders
    (industry and individuals) have the necessary knowledge to engender changes in
    behavior, is a key component of the transition. 5.5. Recommendations for practice
    and policy The UN COP26 conference gained commitment for a number of key initiatives
    that could have a significant impact on global warming. The key commitments included:
    at least 100 countries (including Brazil) agreeing to end deforestation by 2030;
    Led by the US and EU - 80 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by
    2030; Although commitment could not be gained from China, the US, India and Australia
    - 23 nations made new commitments to phase out coal power, including five of the
    top 20 users: Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, Chile and Ukraine; India
    committed to attaining net zero by 2070 (COP26, 2021). Governments have a critical
    role in combating global warming from the legislative and policy perspective,
    but to ensure the targets set for 2050 have a realistic chance of being achieved,
    we need change at a societal level. The IS and technology industry has a critical
    role to play in the monitoring of progress toward net zero, but also a pivotal
    role in the development of innovative solutions to better manage emissions and
    offer people alternatives to current carbon based practices. Many of the contributions
    have highlighted the crucial role of organizations adopting a green philosophy
    and demonstrating a firm commitment to CSR and CDR policies and working practices.
    A number of the experts have discussed the realities of technology contributing
    to the global warming problem due to the high levels of waste and inability for
    manufacturers to adopt a greater sustainability focus on manufacturing materials,
    processes and poor emphasis toward product repair, not replace - so called e-waste.
    The expert input by Professor Metri cites the 2019 UN and WEF reports that 50
    million tonnes of e-waste was produced in that year, with only 20% being dealt
    with sustainably and the rest ending up as landfill. Many articles discuss these
    aspects, highlighting that the IS industry has much to do in this area. Organizations
    have their part to play to align with the goals and commitments from COP26, but
    successful outcomes rely on support from government and institutions to create
    the necessary environment and policy infrastructure, thereby enabling the technology
    industry to make the right long term decisions for the environment and society.
    6. Conclusions The UN climate change conference – COP26 held in Glasgow UK, is
    seen as one of the last chances for governments and key decision makers to make
    the firm commitments needed to ensure global temperatures do not exceed 1.5 °C
    above pre-industrial levels by 2050. The use of technology and IS is an integral
    component of many of the proposed mitigation measures, as governments and societies
    around the world take the necessary steps in transitioning to net zero. This multi-contribution
    editorial study offers a technology focussed and IS perspective on the climate
    crisis where many of the multi-faceted complexities facing governments, organizations
    and decision makers are discussed. In alignment with the approach set out in previous
    studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), each of the invited experts offers their
    own unique viewpoints to explore many of the key topics related to climate change,
    IS and digital technologies. The major technology and IS focussed themes that
    have emerged from the invited experts include: the impact of technology on behaviors
    and attitudes; Education, awareness and changed working practices; Impact on people
    and communities; Responsible digitalization; Role of data, technology and IS governance;
    Technology and IS research agenda. We present this opinion paper as a timely perspective
    on this critical topic where we have discussed the multifaceted role of digital
    technology and IS in combating climate change. The expert contributions highlight
    the urgent need for education initiatives that offer a more holistic and balanced
    perspective on the opportunities for technology based solutions but also communicate
    the realities of the negative impact from e-waste and the shifting of the problem
    to poorer emerging nations. The developed countries throughout the world have
    a responsibility to develop solutions for problems of their own making and a greater
    focus on responsible digitalization has to be the right direction to engender
    sustained change. We advocate a greater awareness from individual consumers as
    well as manufacturers, on the “lived in” realities of environmental tradeoffs
    and key value choices (Rowe, 2018), as we continue to utilize technology as an
    integral component of our daily lives. Decision makers need to be cognisant of
    these key choices, as greater use is made of technology in all its forms to deliver
    net zero by 2050. References Abbas et al., 2021a R. Abbas, S. Hamdoun, J. Abu-Ghazaleh,

  explanation: The study aims at incorporating the latest technological advancements
    into coffee cultivation processes. It employs "Internet of Things" (IoT) and wireless
    sensor networks to monitor and control environmental variables affecting coffee
    quality. The specific parameters tracked include moisture levels, temperature,
    and humidity. Upon detecting extreme measurements, the system will generate alerts
    to facilitate timely mitigation strategies.

    \  [157] \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nIt is clear that support for the \nagricultural\
    \ sector in Colombia has not \nbeen the most appropriate over the years; \ngovernment\
    \ assistance for farmers is not \navailable or often based on policies and \n\
    procedures that are poorly defined or that, \nin \nmany \ncases, \ndepend \non\
    \ \npolitical \ninterests \nfor \ntheir \napproval \nand \nimplementation. \n\
    For that reason, there are countless \ndrawbacks \nwhen \nthe \nharvesting \n\
    and \nproduction processes are optimized. Our \ncountry has an enormous agricultural\
    \ \npotential, but government support is very \nlimited or nonexistent, and other\
    \ factors \n(such as the high price of agricultural \ninputs and high interest\
    \ rates for farm \ncredits) end up discouraging investment in \nthe field. Nevertheless,\
    \ the rise of new \ntechnologies has enabled the improvement \nand automation\
    \ of industrial processes in \nall fields of production, including coffee.  \n\
    For that reason, aided by technology, \nan agricultural sector such as the coffee\
    \ \nindustry has the potential to take the \ncountry’s productivity to new horizons,\
    \ in \naddition to providing countless benefits for \nproduction processes and\
    \ the optimization \nof final products [1]. \nPrecision \nAgriculture \n(PA) \n\
    covers \nmultiple \npractices \nrelated \nto \nthe \nmanagement \nof \ncrops,\
    \ \ntrees, \nflowers, \nplants, etc. One of its most interesting \napplications\
    \ is the control of pests and \ndiseases [2]. By means of strategically \nplaced\
    \ \nsensors, \nparameters \n(such \nas \ntemperature and relative humidity of\
    \ the \nsoil, temperature and humidity of the \nleaves, and solar radiation) can\
    \ also be \nmonitored in order to quickly detect \nadverse \nsituations \nand\
    \ \nestablish \nthe \nappropriate treatments. Another great \nadvantage of the\
    \ use of this technology is \nthe \ntimely \ndetection \nand \noptimal \napplication\
    \ of pesticides only in those areas \nwhere it is really necessary [3]. \nOne\
    \ of the most significant problems \nthat currently arise in agriculture is the\
    \ \nconstant monitoring and control of the \nenvironmental variables that affect\
    \ its \nactivities, from the sowing process to \nobtaining the final product.\
    \ Therefore, PA \nenters the stage because it can be \nimplemented in any type\
    \ of crop and labor \nas long as there is spatial variability (i.e., \nusable\
    \ spaces), regardless of the area \nwhere it will be carried out. \nIn a very\
    \ general way, the specific \naspects of PA can be adapted to each \nproductive\
    \ system and variables such as \nclimate, temperature, humidity, soil type, \n\
    genetic material, and management system \n[4]. \nColombia is known for producing\
    \ the \nbest soft coffee in the world. Its production, \naccording to reports\
    \ by the National \nFederation of Coffee Growers (the entity \nthat \nrepresents\
    \ \nColombian \nproducers \ninternationally), has grown by 26 % \ncompared to\
    \ 2011. That makes the Latin-\nAmerican \ncountry \nthe \nthird \nlargest \nproducer\
    \ of coffee beans worldwide. The \nFederation, along with coffee growers, has\
    \ \npromoted aspects like the renovation of \ncrops and sowing special and organic\
    \ \ncoffees, \namong \nother \nstrategies, \nto \nencourage the cultivation of\
    \ the grain [5]. \nFor that reason, in this work, we \npropose the design, development,\
    \ and \nsubsequent implementation of a wireless \nsensor system applying the concept\
    \ of the \nIoT (Internet of Things) [6], in order to \nestablish a set of measurements,\
    \ alerts, \nand controls to improve the production and \nquality of coffee crops\
    \ [7]. \nThe design and development of this \nsensor system offer traditional\
    \ farmers an \ninvaluable agricultural technification tool, \nwhich allows them\
    \ to increase their \neconomic \nbenefits, \nreduce \ntheir \nenvironmental \n\
    impact, \nand \ntherefore \nimprove their quality of life. From another \nviewpoint,\
    \ PA tends to result in a higher \nquality product thanks to its well-known \n\
    optimization of resources; moreover, it \nApplication of the Internet of things\

    \ predictive element to avoid \npossible crop losses due to lack of \nmanagement,\
    \ \nsupervision, \nor \ntimely \nactions. \n \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\
    \ \n2.1 Conceptual Background \n \nThe Internet of Things continues to set \n\
    the pace in many aspects, areas, and \nprocesses of scientific and technological\
    \ \ndevelopment throughout the world. In \naddition, it is expected to do so,\
    \ at least, \nover the next ten years, and, according to \nforecasts, billions\
    \ of devices connected to \nthe internet are expected to be monitoring \nand controlling\
    \ various aspects of daily life \n[8]. \nAgricultural production is affected by\
    \ \nsoil, \nclimate, \nand \ncrop \nmanagement \ncomponents, which interact and\
    \ create \nmore than 50 factors that influence it in \ndifferent ways [9]. These\
    \ components \npresent spatial and temporal variability, \nwhich, in many cases,\
    \ is also reflected in \nthe production [4]-[9]. \nHowever, with the modernization\
    \ of \nagricultural \npractices, \nnew \nchallenges \narise, mainly regarding\
    \ the concept of \nenvironmental and economic sustainability \nof production process.\
    \ In the face these \nnew challenges, the research, extension, \nand innovation\
    \ departments in sectors \nrelated to agriculture have responded by \ndeveloping\
    \ technology that can be used to \ndevelop techniques to quantify and manage \n\
    the natural variability of the producing \narea in a different way [10]. \nSoil\
    \ and crop characteristics vary in \nspace (distance and depth) and time. \nWhere\
    \ A is a set of techniques aimed at \noptimizing the use of agricultural inputs\
    \ \n(seeds, agrochemicals, and of the coffee \ncorrective) based on the quantification\
    \ of \nspatial \nand \ntemporal \nvariability \nof \nagricultural production.\
    \ Such optimization \nis achieved with the distribution of the \ncorrect quantity\
    \ of these inputs depending \non the potential and the needs of each \npoint in\
    \ the managed areas [5], [10]. \nIn another work, an instrumentation \nsystem\
    \ \nwas \nimplemented \nin \nthe \ngreenhouse La Aldana, an agro-ecological \n\
    unit \nat \nthe \nUniversity \nof \nQuindío, \nColombia [11]. Said system measures\
    \ \nphysical variables such as temperature, \nrelative humidity, \nand soil moisture.\
    \ \nSubsequently, these data are controlled \ninside the greenhouse and simultaneously\
    \ \nmonitored wirelessly; then, depending on \nthe \ndata, \nthe \nsystem \nautonomously\
    \ \nactivates a hysteresis drip control system \nthat rationalizes the use of\
    \ irrigation \nsystem water. \nBy means of the Internet of Things and \nthe application\
    \ of PA, this technological \nsolution (focused on monitoring a coffee \ncrop)\
    \ offers a high level of control, through \nthe deployment of a set of devices\
    \ that \ncollect information and transmit it for \nsubsequent analysis and comparison\
    \ with \nestablished parameters, in order to make \ntimely decisions [12]. For\
    \ that purpose, the \nsystem takes a series of variables related \nto the percentage\
    \ of soil moisture, ambient \ntemperature, and relative air humidity as \nbaselines.\
    \ The permanent control of these \nvalues seeks to provide an invaluable tool\
    \ \nto \nminimize \ncoffee \ngrowers’ \narduous \nmanual work of controlling and\
    \ monitoring \nextensive coffee crops; furthermore, such \nvariables also determine\
    \ the quality of the \ncrops that are produced [11], [12]. \n \n2.2 Research Methodology\
    \ \n \nThis applied study includes hardware \nand software components that must\
    \ be \ndesigned \nand \ntested. \nTherefore, \na \nmethodology should be proposed\
    \ in order to \nfollow the scientific method and integrate \nand develop electronic\
    \ devices and their \ninteraction with a software application, \nwhich will be\
    \ available on the internet in \nthe future. The methodological phases of \ncan\

    \ \n2.4 Components \nof \na \nwireless \nsensor \nnetwork \n \nAccording to [15],\
    \ the components or \nelements of a wireless sensor network are: \nSensors: These\
    \ devices are responsible \nfor taking the information from their \nenvironment\
    \ \nand \nconverting \nit \ninto \nelectrical signals that are delivered to a\
    \ \ncontrol system. Eventually, they can be of \nany type and measure any type\
    \ of variable \n(light, temperature, wind, pressure, and \nhumidity, among others).\
    \ \nActuators: These devices, following the \norders of the control system, perform\
    \ a \nseries of actions that affect or have an \nimpact on the real world (e.g.,\
    \ opening a \nvalve, closing a membrane, lighting a \nbulb). \nSensor nodes: They\
    \ receive the data \ncollected by the sensor through their data \nports and send\
    \ the information to the base \nstation. Sensor nodes must have a low \npower\
    \ processor, as well as a radio \ntransceiver with the same feature; for that\
    \ \npurpose, optimized software must be \nadded, which requires some resources,\
    \ \nmaking the power consumption even more \nrestrictive. \n \nIntermediate nodes:\
    \ These devices \nare in charge of extending the reach of the \nnetwork, \ncircumventing\
    \ \nobstacles \nto \nwireless \ntransmission \nand \nproviding \nalternative routes\
    \ for the transit of the \nmessages that are sent to the gateway. \nGateway: This\
    \ is a key device in the \nsystem because it serves as an interface \nbetween\
    \ the application platform and the \nnodes that make up the network. It also \n\
    allows the connection between the system \nand the environments because it handles\
    \ \ndifferent types of protocols and can operate \nin the upper layers of the\
    \ OSI model \n(transport, presentation, application, and \nsession), thus enabling\
    \ the conversion of \nprotocols to interconnect networks with \ndifferent high-level\
    \ protocols. \nWireless network: A medium for \ntransmitting information, typically\
    \ based \non the 802.15.4 standard (ZigBee). \nBase station: It is responsible\
    \ for \nconnecting and coordinating intermediate \nnodes in order to collect data\
    \ from the \nnetwork; it is usually made up of a PC or \nan embedded visualization\
    \ system. \nThe architecture of a sensor node, \naccording to the IEEE 802.14\
    \ Standard, \ncan be visualized in Fig. 2. \n \n \nFig. 2. Architecture of a sensor\
    \ node applying IEEE 802.14.4. Source: [16]. \nApplication of the Internet of\

    \ ZigBee protocol  \n \nThe ZigBee Alliance was formed by an \nassociation \n\
    of \nindustries \nthat \nwork \ntogether \nto \ndevelop \nstandards \nand \nproducts.\
    \ ZigBee is the name of the \nspecification of a set of high-level wireless \n\
    communication protocols designed for low-\npower digital broadcasting applications\
    \ \nbased on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for \nwireless personal area networks\
    \ (Wireless \nPersonal Area Network, WPAN) operating \nat 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and\
    \ 2.4 GHz. \nZigBee technology is integrated into a wide \nrange of products and\
    \ applications for \ncommercial, industrial, and government \nconsumers [10],\
    \ [15]. \nIn the Fig. 3, we can visualize the \nconnectivity between the gateway,\
    \ the \nsensor nodes and the online platform in \ncharge of receiving the data.\
    \ \nThe objective of this technology is not to \nattain very high transmission\
    \ speeds (it \ncan only reach a rate of 20 to 250 Kbps in a \nrange of 10 to 75\
    \ meters), but to implement \nsensors whose transceivers offer very low \npower\
    \ consumption. In fact, some devices \ncan operate for 2 years powered by the\
    \ \nsame two AA batteries. Therefore, ZigBee \ndevices spend most of their time\
    \ in a stand \nby state, that is, sleeping to consume much \nless power [18].\
    \ Fig. 4 presents the protocol \nstack of the ZigBee standard. \nIn order to select\
    \ a technology to \ntransmit information in wireless networks, \nmany aspects\
    \ should be considered, such \nas transmission rates, costs, distances \nbetween\
    \ \nnodes, \nand \nmaintaining \nthe \nbattery charge of the devices outdoors.\
    \ The \nZigBee standard was selected for the \nfollowing technical characteristics;\
    \ thanks \nto \nwhich \nit \nstands \nout \nover \nother \nalternatives: \n-Low\
    \ consumption that enables the use \nof \nconventional \nalkaline \nbatteries\
    \ \n[15], [18]. \n-Low \ndevice, \ninstallation, \nand \nmaintenance costs. \n\
    -High performance and low latency for \nlow duty cycle devices work, very suitable\
    \ \nfor sensors and controls. \n-Easy \nintegration \nwith \nother \ntechnologies\

    \ of wireless networks \n \nThe word “topology” can describe two \naspects of\
    \ wireless networks:  on the one \nhand, at the physical level, how the \ndifferent\
    \ hardware-level devices that make \nup the WSN network are distributed; and,\
    \ \non the other hand, at the logical level, how \nthe data is transmitted throughout\
    \ the \nnetwork. That is why it is so important to \ndefine the physical and logical\
    \ topologies \naccording \nto \nthe \nsolution \nto \nbe \nimplemented. \nIn addition\
    \ to the classical mesh of \nWSNs, \ntwo \nother \ntopologies \ncan \nbe \nadopted:\
    \ In star networks, each wireless \nnode \ndirectly \ncommunicates \nwith \na\
    \ \ngateway \ndevice \nthat \nacts \nas \na \ncommunication \nbridge \nwith \n\
    a \nwired \nnetwork. In cluster trees (an emerging and \ncommon intermediate solution\
    \ in WSNs), \nthe \nrouters \ncommunicate \nwith \nthe \ngateway; the sensors\
    \ only need to establish \nthe point-to-point communication with the \nrouters\
    \ and, therefore, they can remain \nsimple and low- power while improving the\
    \ \nrange and redundancy of the network itself \n[20]. \nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ defines two \ntypes of devices: Full Function Devices \n(FFDs) and Reduced Function\
    \ Devices \n(RFDs). FFDs contain the complete set of \nMAC services and can operate\
    \ as a PAN \n(Personal Area Network) coordinator or as \na simple network device.\
    \ In turn, RFDs \ncontain a small set of MAC services and \ncan operate only as\
    \ a network device \n[5], [20]. \nSaid standard assumes the use of star, \ncluster\
    \ tree, and point-to-point topologies, \nand \nit \nprovides \nthe \nstructure\
    \ \nfor \nprogramming in the application layer. Its \nobjective is to support\
    \ the development of \napplications for wireless networks that \nrequire secure\
    \ and stable communications \nwith low data rates and reduced energy \nconsumption\
    \ [17]. \nIn Fig. 5 the star topology consumes the \nleast energy, but it has\
    \ limitations such as \nthe radio transmission distance between \neach \nsensor\
    \ \nnode \nand \nthe \ngateway. \nMoreover, it does not offer an alternative \n\
    communication path in case one of the \nsensor \nnodes \nhas \nobstructed \nthe\
    \ \ncommunication path, which would lead to \nthe loss of the information of that\
    \ node. In \nsaid topology, all the sensor nodes are \nidentical and the gateway\
    \ is in charge of \ncapturing the information or sending data \nbetween them.\
    \ The gateway is also used to \ntransmit data outside the network and \nmonitor\
    \ the network [3], [20]. \nApplication of the Internet of things through a network\

    \  \n \nFig. 5. shows the proposed architecture \nfor the sensor network that\
    \ will allow the \ncontrol and monitoring of a coffee crop. For \nthat purpose,\
    \ a plot of less than 1 hectare \nwas defined as the cultivated land, located\
    \ \non Santa Ana Farm in Pueblo Tapao, \nDepartment of Quindío, Colombia. \nThe\
    \ sensor nodes are responsible for \nmonitoring environmental variables such \n\
    as soil temperature and humidity, ambient \ntemperature, \nand \nrainfall \nindex,\
    \ \nprecipitation level using a rainfall meter \n[21].  \nA gateway can also be\
    \ seen in Fig. 5. Its \nrole is to send the information collected by \nthe sensor\
    \ nodes to the coordinator node \nresponsible \nfor \nestablishing \nthe \ncommunication\
    \ with the central unit, \nwhich is composed of a computer with \ninternet \n\
    connection \nthat \nuploads \nthe \nreceived information to a cloud storage site\
    \ \nfor processing and further analysis. \n \n3.1 Components of the proposed sensor\
    \ \nnetwork  \n \nThe network proposed in this work \nincludes multiple sensor\
    \ nodes, whose \nobjective \nis, \nbasically, \nto \nbe \ndata \nacquisition units\

    visualized in Fig. 6. The measurements of \nthe variables are transmitted to the\

    \  [167] \n4.  COFEE \nAND \nITS \nENVIRONMENTAL \nVARIABLES \n \nIn this section,\
    \ we discuss a series of \nenvironmental variables that, in one way \nor another,\
    \ affect coffee planting and \ncultivation. Such variables are analyzed in \n\
    order to obtain essential information \nthrough the sensor network, the object\
    \ of \nstudy of the present work. \n \n4.1 Temperature \n \nThe optimal temperature\
    \ for Arabic \ncoffee cultivation is between 19 and \n21.5 ºC. \nIn cold climates,\
    \ where the average \ntemperature is less than 19 ºC, coffee \nvarieties develop\
    \ less, their production is \nlower, and the harvest is distributed \nthroughout\
    \ the year. \nIn hot climates, where the average \ntemperature is higher than\
    \ 21.5 ºC, the \nproductive life of coffee trees is shorter, the \nharvest can\
    \ be reaped earlier and is more \nconcentrated, the attack of rust is more \n\
    severe, and pests such as the coffee berry \nborer and leaf miner increase. \n\
    Air humidity or relative humidity. \nThis component of the climate presents \n\
    high variations between day and night. In \ncoffee growing areas, the air is usually\
    \ \nhumid [27]. \n \n4.2 Winds \n \n- They are responsible for transporting \n\
    water vapor and clouds, changing some \ncomponents of the climate such as rainfall,\
    \ \ntemperature, and solar radiation. \n- In general, the most suitable areas\
    \ for \ncoffee cultivation are characterized by \nweak winds. \n \n4.3 Rains \n\
    \ \n-Between 1,800 and 2,800 millimeters \nof rain per year, well distributed\
    \ among \nthe 12 months, are considered appropriate \nfor \ncoffee \ncultivation.\
    \ \nAt \nleast \n120 \nmillimeters per month are required. \n-Periods of abundant\
    \ rain favor the \npresence of diseases such as pink and \nleaky. \n-Excess rains\
    \ can also affect the \nflowering \nof \nthe \ncoffee \nplantation, \ndiminishing\
    \ it or damaging it. \n-Droughts can cause the leaves of the \ncoffee tree to\
    \ fall off, due to lack of water, \nand the attack of pests (such as the red \n\
    spider mite, the leaf miner, and the coffee \nberry borer) to increase [28]. \n\
    -In the Colombian “coffee-producing \nregion”, the crop is harvested most of the\
    \ \nyear thanks to its particular distribution of \nrainy cycles, unlike in other\
    \ regions and \ncountries \nwhere \nthere \nis \na \nsingle \nconcentrated harvest\
    \ cycle. \n-This rainfall regime is the result of the \npassage, twice a year,\
    \ of the Intertropical \nConvergence Zone (ITCZ), which is located \non the equator,\
    \ where the trade winds \nfrom \nthe \nNorthern \nand \nSouthern \nhemispheres\
    \ converge. This phenomenon \ngenerates two periods of intense rains \n(from March\
    \ to May and from October to \nDecember) that benefit the entire coffee \nproduction\
    \ cycle [9]-[28]. \n \n4.4 Soil for cultivation \n \n-The soil is essential for\
    \ coffee trees \nbecause it provides the support, water, and \nnutrients they\
    \ need for their growth, \ndevelopment, and production. \n-It is produced by the\
    \ disintegration \nand slow decomposition of rocks, mainly \ncaused by the action\
    \ of water, temperature, \nand \nwinds. \nIn \nsome \nregions, \nthese \nprocesses\
    \ are accompanied by ash from \nvolcanoes. With the passage of time, the \nresulting\

    \ AND DISCUSSION \n \nDistance \ntests \nwere \nconducted \nto \ndetermine the\
    \ maximum range of the \nXbee-Pro S2 C wireless modules in order to \nensure reliable\
    \ data transmission without \nsignal \nlosses \nor \nattenuation; \ntheir \nmaximum\
    \ range was found to be 100 \nmeters in outdoors. \nEstablished \nthat \ncoffee\
    \ \ncultivation \nmanagement is quite complex, taking into \naccount the variability\
    \ of species, terrains, \nand specific environmental conditions that \nultimately\
    \ affect the production process \nand final grain quality [16], [29]. \nIt \n\
    was \ndetermined \nthat \nthe \ndevelopment \nand \nimplementation \nof \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks are now more \nfeasible due to the low costs of sensors, \n\
    programmable cards, and communication \nmodules, as well as open-source hardware\
    \ \nand software which do not require users to \npay for licenses [5], [16]. All\
    \ those factors \nmake WSNs profitable for coffee growers. \nIn \nthis \nstudy,\
    \ \nthe \nincidence \nof \nenvironmental variables on the cultivation \nand \n\
    production \nof \nthe \ngrain \nwas \ndetermined by establishing how they affect\
    \ \nthe final quality of the crop.  \nIt was established that, through the \n\
    Ubidots platform, information is uploaded \nto the cloud, allowing users to access\
    \ this \ninformation from any device that has an \ninternet connection and can\
    \ graphically \nvisualize the behavior of variables and \nalert signals in case\
    \ of parameters are \nfound outside normal ranges [16]-[26]. \nIt was determined\
    \ that the application \nof the IoT to PA is an excellent tool for \nmonitoring\
    \ and controlling environmental \nvariables, allowing the introduction of \ntechnology\
    \ into agriculture and, more \nspecifically, into coffee cultivation. \nThe WSN\
    \ proposed here \nwill be \nimplemented on Santa Ana Farm, in \nPueblo Tapao,\
    \ which is located 15 Km from \nthe city of Armenia, the capital of the \nDepartment\
    \ of Quindío, Colombia. The \nmain characteristics of the farm can be \nseen in\
    \ Table 2. \nAdditionally, the Lucy 3 programmable \ncards in each sensor node\
    \ are programmed \nto receive the values sent by each of the \nsensors, process\
    \ said data, and send them \nto the monitoring center, where the \nmeasured values\
    \ will be analyzed. It will \nalso be determined if the values lie within \nthe\
    \ programmed ranges, in order to be able \nto trigger the alert system in case\
    \ they \nexceed their specific allowed ranges. The \ntechnical specifications\
    \ of the internal \ncomponents of the programmable cards are \ndescribed below\

    \ \nand \ncomponents of wireless sensor networks \nand proposed their use in various\
    \ crops in \nColombia. \nBased \non \nthe \nparameters \nanalyzed here, we could\
    \ established that \none of the main problems in coffee crops is \nintense humidity,\
    \ which, in the practice, \naffects the performance of the sensors and \ntheir\
    \ measurements. This is reflected in \nthe fact that the intensity of the signal\
    \ \nreceived from the Zigbee devices fluctuated \nmore than in sites with dry\
    \ climatic \nconditions.  \nThere is evidence of coffee growers’ \nlittle knowledge\
    \ of technology and its \napplications in agriculture, due in part to \ntheir\
    \ lack of education and their heritage \nof traditional methods for growing and\
    \ \nproducing coffee. Among the fundamental \nfactors that affect coffee crops,\
    \ soil quality \nwas found to be one of the most important \nbecause on it depends\
    \ the growth speed \nand development of the trees; the start, \nquantity, and\
    \ quality of the production; the \ncrop’s resistance to the attack of pests and\
    \ \ndiseases; and the duration of the trees’ \nproductive life. \nZigbee technology\
    \ was proposed for this \nproject due to its low cost compared to \nother wireless\
    \ technologies with similar \ncharacteristics. \nThis study was a first approach\
    \ to how \nto establish warning signals according to \nestimated parameters, since\
    \ the measuring \nranges of the environmental variables are \ndetermined by the\
    \ agronomist who assists \nthe crop. Unfortunately, the tests and \nimplementation\
    \ \nof \nall \nthe \nestimated \nsensorization for the project were not \ncompleted.\

    Abstract: Sensors have been used in various agricultural production scenarios
    due to signiﬁcant

    advances in the Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT), leading to smart agriculture.
    Intelligent

    control or monitoring systems rely heavily on trustworthy sensor systems. Nonetheless,
    sensor

    failures are likely due to various factors, including key equipment malfunction
    or human error. A

    faulty sensor can produce corrupted measurements, resulting in incorrect decisions.
    Early detection

    of potential faults is crucial, and fault diagnosis techniques have been proposed.
    The purpose of

    sensor fault diagnosis is to detect faulty data in the sensor and recover or isolate
    the faulty sensors so

    that the sensor can ﬁnally provide correct data to the user. Current fault diagnosis
    technologies are

    based mainly on statistical models, artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning, etc.
    The further development

    of fault diagnosis technology is also conducive to reducing the loss caused by
    sensor failures.

    Keywords: agricultural Internet of Things; sensors; fault diagnosis; deep learning

    1. Introduction

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used in various ﬁelds, such as intelligent
    health-

    care [1], smart agriculture [2], smart transportation [3], the smart home [4],
    and the smart

    city [5,6]. The agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) has been widely used
    in agricul-

    tural scenarios such as ﬁeld planting, livestock and poultry breeding, aquaculture,
    facility

    horticulture, and agricultural product logistics traceability as an important
    development

    direction of “Internet +” agriculture to realize the comprehensive perception
    of the agri-

    cultural production process, intelligent decision analysis, and early warning,
    and ﬁnally

    achieve the goal of precision agriculture and intelligent agriculture. The Ag-IoT
    has been

    used for a long time in many countries, and the technology is relatively mature.
    The United

    States began to use computers for intelligent irrigation and production management
    in

    the 1980s. Ag-IoT coverage on large farms in the United States has reached 80%.
    In 2004,

    Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications proposed the U-Japan plan,
    which

    included Ag-IoT technology developed primarily by NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and Mitsui.

    China proposed the “Sensing China” strategy in 2009 [7], and related research
    and the

    application of Ag-IoT also began to develop rapidly.

    Sensors, the core of Ag-IoT, are primarily used to collect various data in the
    agricultural

    production process. Furthermore, sensors can be integrated with other systems
    to enhance

    automatic control capabilities. However, agricultural sensors are prone to frequent
    faults due

    to poor deployment environments and remote deployment locations. For example,
    when

    a temperature and humidity sensor is biased or drifts, the irrigation system will
    not work

    correctly [8]. If the sensor in the robot system fails, it may face paralysis
    [9,10]. Incorrect

    detection values of sensors will lead to wrong decisions in intelligent agriculture
    systems [11,

    12]. Unmanned aircraft may lose control or even crash due to problems with the
    gyroscope

    and accelerometer [13]. Due to the influence of the external environment, sensor
    aging is also a

    source of sensor failures, leading to incorrect decisions [14] and failure to
    transmit information

    normally [15]. In different application scenarios, sensor failures can cause significant
    human,

    economic, and environmental losses and reduce the quality of IoT service.

    Since Beard [16] proposed fault diagnosis technology in 1971, experts and scholars

    have conducted extensive research in sensor fault diagnosis. Figure 1 depicts
    the research

    progress of sensor fault diagnosis technology [16–26]. Early sensor fault diagnosis
    methods

    relied on experience and simple ways to pinpoint the location and cause of a problem,
    such

    as sensor redundancy, function redundancy, and characteristics tracking [27].
    Sensor redun-

    dancy is the use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameter, the linear
    combination

    of the measured values of several sensors is converted into an estimated value,
    and the final

    comparison of the measured value with the estimated value is used to determine
    whether

    faults occur. This method, however, raises hardware costs. Functional redundancy

    systems  to  enhance  automatic  control  capabilities.  However,  agricultural 
    sensors  are 

    prone to frequent faults due to poor deployment environments and remote deployment 

    locations. For example, when a temperature and humidity sensor is biased or drifts, the 

    irrigation system will not work correctly [8]. If the sensor in the robot system fails, it may 

    face paralysis [9,10]. Incorrect detection values of sensors will lead to wrong decisions in 

    intelligent agriculture systems [11,12]. Unmanned aircraft may lose control or even crash 

    due to problems with the gyroscope and accelerometer [13]. Due to the influence of the 

    external environment, sensor aging is also a source of sensor failures, leading to incorrect 

    decisions [14] and failure to transmit information normally [15]. In different application 

    scenarios,  sensor  failures  can  cause  significant  human,  economic,  and 
    environmental 

    losses and reduce the quality of IoT service. 

    Since Beard [16] proposed fault diagnosis technology in 1971, experts and scholars 

    have conducted extensive research in sensor fault diagnosis. Figure 1 depicts the research 

    progress  of  sensor  fault  diagnosis  technology  [16–26].  Early  sensor  fault 
    diagnosis 

    methods relied on experience and simple ways to pinpoint the location and cause of a 

    problem, such as sensor redundancy, function redundancy, and characteristics tracking 

    [27]. Sensor redundancy is the use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameter, the 

    linear  combination  of  the  measured  values  of  several  sensors  is  converted 
    into  an 

    estimated value, and the final comparison of the measured value with the estimated value 

    is used to determine whether faults occur. This method, however, raises hardware costs. 

    Functional redundancy uses information from each sensor in the system to determine 

    whether  there  is  a  fault  via  the  relationship  between  sensors  in  heterogeneous 
    and 

    homogeneous locations. Characterization tracking determines whether the sensor values 

    are within acceptable limits.

    systems.

    With the widespread adoption of Ag-IoT and the rise of machine learning, a new

    method for sensor fault diagnosis has emerged. A fault diagnosis model that has
    been

    trained with a large amount of data has a faster and more accurate effect [28].
    In particular,

    as deep learning exhibits powerful data representation learning and analysis capabilities,
    it

    can meet the requirements of high-order, nonlinear, adaptive feature extraction
    for sensor

    fault diagnosis [29]. A sensor fault diagnosis method based on Ag-IoT can overcome
    the

    limitations of early sensor fault diagnosis by fully using more technical support,
    such as

    machine learning, statistical analysis, and signal processing, to realize remote
    real-time

    online fault diagnosis, even without the presence of maintenance personnel. The
    system can

    diagnose itself and recover or isolate the corresponding fault, allowing the sensor
    network

    to continue operating normally after the fault occurs while improving the intelligent
    level

    of fault diagnosis [30].

    This paper offers an overview of Ag-IoT sensor fault diagnosis technology. First,

    sensor networks and sensors are introduced, and the current state of sensor research
    is

    reviewed. The sensor fault is investigated using Ag-IoT characteristics. The common
    fault

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    root causes, fault types, and sensor fault characteristics are discussed. The
    methods and

    strategies for detecting sensor faults are thoroughly examined. Finally, the future
    direction

    of sensor fault diagnosis development is discussed.

    2. Background of Sensors and Sensor Networks in the Ag-IoT

    2.1. Sensors and Sensor Networks

    Smart agriculture requires the deployment of various sensors on farmland, crops,
    ani-

    mals, and agricultural equipment. High-quality, high-resolution, high-reliability
    professional

    agricultural sensors must be designed and developed to sense the physiological
    markers

    of agricultural production environments, animals, and plants. According to the
    different

    detection objects, sensors can be divided into many types, such as gas sensors,
    temperature

    and humidity sensors, illuminance sensors, nutrient element sensors, and so on.

    Sensor networks are broadly classiﬁed into two types: wired sensor networks and

    wireless sensor networks. Wired sensor networks do not meet the requirements of
    remote

    deployment areas, wide monitoring areas, and low cost due to the shortcomings
    of complex

    wiring and the high cost of wired sensors. In comparison, wireless sensor networks

    have the advantages of ﬂexible installation and low cost, and they are being used
    in an

    increasing number of agricultural ﬁelds. The self-organization of a large number
    of wireless

    sensors forms a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A WSN can remotely transmit data
    from

    various detection objects in the monitoring area to terminal users in real time
    and quickly.

    It can be deployed in remote areas to overcome wired limitations. A WSN consists
    of

    sensor modules, processor modules, wireless communication modules, and energy
    supply

    modules. The sensor module collects environmental information and converts the
    collected

    signal to digital analog; the processor module ﬁlters and processes the data;
    the wireless

    communication module sends the collected information to the sink node or base
    station;

    and the energy supply module is in charge of the entire wireless sensor’s energy
    supply,

    including power supply, solar power, and wind power. Wireless sensors are typically

    dispersed at random throughout the monitoring area. The collected data are transmitted

    multi-hop between nodes before being wirelessly transmitted to the base station
    [31]. With

    the advances in communication technology, many different types of wireless networks

    have emerged, as shown in Table 1. The deployment nodes of agricultural sensors
    can be

    adjusted to meet the various service requirements of agricultural applications.

    2.2. Agricultural Internet of Things

    The world recognizes the IoT as the third wave of the world’s information industry

    after computers, the Internet, and mobile communication networks. It can realize
    a com-

    prehensive network of people and people, people and things, and things and things.
    As

    agriculture enters the 4.0 era, the current planting and breeding industry are
    showing the

    characteristics of scale and reﬁnement through the integration of agriculture
    with emerging

    technologies such as the IoT, big data, artiﬁcial intelligence, etc., via various
    sensors to

    collect information, such as temperature, humidity, nitrate content in the soil,
    conductivity,

    and PH [37]. Monitoring and controlling essential factors that affect crop growth
    and

    yield can signiﬁcantly reduce economic losses through the timely discovery of
    risks in the

    breeding process. The continuous emergence of intelligent agricultural equipment
    will

    promote the automation and intellectualization of agriculture. As shown in Figure
    2, IoT

    technology is currently widely used in agriculture, including precision agriculture,
    livestock

    monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁsheries management, and weather tracking [38,39].

    2.3. Research Status of Ag-IoT Sensors

    The implementation of Ag-IoT systems is reliant on multi-functional intelligent
    sensors.

    The wide range of sensors includes agricultural environmental sensors, agricultural
    animal

    and plant life information sensors, agricultural product information sensors,
    and other

    agricultural sensors (such as position information and pressure information sensors).
    The

    primary function of agricultural sensors is to collect data on numerous agricultural
    factors,

    including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and gas concentration in the
    ﬁeld planting

    industry; ammonia and carbon dioxide levels, air quality, temperature, and humidity
    in

    the livestock and poultry breeding industry; dissolved oxygen, salinity, carbon
    dioxide,

    and ammonium nitrogen in aquaculture; and temperature, humidity, light intensity,
    and

    carbon dioxide in facility horticulture. In terms of principle and method, agricultural

    sensors based on an electrical sensing mechanism are primarily used for temperature
    and

    humidity sensing [40]. Sensors utilizing a photoelectric sensing mechanism are
    mainly

    employed to measure light intensity, gas composition, and phenotypic object displacement.

    Sensors based on an electrochemical sensing mechanism are primarily used to detect

    temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations, including oxygen, carbon dioxide,
    and

    ammonia. However, at present, the intelligence and technological maturity of agricultural

    environment sensors are low. Although numerous companies are conducting this type
    of

    sensor research, only a few companies research animal and plant physiological
    information

    sensors due to technological and ﬁnancial limitations. Table 2 displays representative

    agricultural sensor systems in the Ag-IoT.

    3. Types and Characteristics of Sensor Faults

    Sensors in the Ag-IoT structure are prone to many faults during data acquisition

    and transmission. A sensor fault refers to a sensor whose sensing or transmitting
    data

    is signiﬁcantly different from other sensor data; the data don’t conform to the
    expected

    normal behavior or are highly consistent with the deﬁned characteristics of fault
    data [63].

    According to the acquisition process analysis, agricultural sensors are typically
    deployed

    in unattended and harsh indoor or outdoor environments. Wireless sensors usually
    have

    limited resources such as power, memory, and computing resources. Long-term use

    damages the sensor module, power module, and other wireless sensor hardware, resulting

    in irreparable faults that prevent the sensor from collecting data normally.

    According to the transmission process analysis, the complex agricultural environment,

    such as crops, terrain, and greenhouse walls, impacts wireless sensor communication.

    Due to a fault in the agricultural wireless sensor communication module, external
    attacks,

    and limited communication capabilities, data transmission fails, and sensor data
    collected

    cannot normally be sent to the server [64].

    3.1. Types of Sensor Faults

    The hard fault and soft fault types are distinguished by the duration of the sensor
    fault.

    Hard faults are permanent faults that persist until the fault recovery phase.
    Soft faults are

    temporary faults that disappear after a certain period. Figure 3 depicts the classiﬁcation
    of

    hard faults and soft faults.

    3. Types and Characteristics of Sensor Faults 

    Sensors in the Ag‐IoT structure are prone to many faults during data acquisition and 

    transmission.  A  sensor  fault  refers  to  a  sensor  whose  sensing  or  transmitting 
    data  is 

    significantly  different  from  other  sensor  data;  the  data  don’t  conform 
    to  the  expected 

    normal behavior or are highly consistent with the defined characteristics of fault data [63]. 

    According to the acquisition process analysis, agricultural sensors are typically deployed 

    in unattended and harsh indoor or outdoor environments. Wireless sensors usually have 

    limited  resources  such  as  power,  memory,  and  computing  resources.  Long‐term 
    use 

    damages  the  sensor  module,  power  module,  and  other  wireless  sensor  hardware, 

    resulting in irreparable faults that prevent the sensor from collecting data normally. 

    According  to  the  transmission  process  analysis,  the  complex  agricultural 

    environment,  such  as  crops,  terrain,  and  greenhouse  walls,  impacts  wireless 
    sensor 

    communication. Due to a fault in the agricultural wireless sensor communication module, 

    external  attacks,  and  limited  communication  capabilities,  data  transmission 
    fails,  and 

    sensor data collected cannot normally be sent to the server [64]. 

    3.1. Types of Sensor Faults 

    The hard fault and soft fault types are distinguished by the duration of the sensor 

    fault. Hard faults are permanent faults that persist until the fault recovery phase. Soft 

    faults  are  temporary  faults  that  disappear  after  a  certain  period.  Figure

    3.1.1. Hard Fault 

    A hard fault refers to the damage or failure of the agricultural sensor’s hardware, 

    resulting  in  a  sensor  fault.  A  hard  fault  prevents  the  sensor  from 
    collecting  and 

    Figure 3. Types of sensor faults in agricultural sensor systems.

    3.1.1. Hard Fault

    A hard fault refers to the damage or failure of the agricultural sensor’s hardware,
    resulting

    in a sensor fault. A hard fault prevents the sensor from collecting and transmitting
    data

    normally, including a transmitter circuit fault, receiver circuit fault, microcontroller
    fault,

    sensor circuit fault, and power fault. A sensor with poor circuit contact is highly
    susceptible

    to short-circuit faults. Circuit disconnection results in an open circuit sensor
    fault. The

    poor working environment causes sensor hardware to malfunction. Most of these
    faults are

    permanent and require the replacement of defective hardware or maintenance circuits.

    Researchers report that power supply failures are the primary cause of sensor
    data

    errors [65]. The primary factor limiting wireless sensors is the power supply
    [66]. Wireless

    sensors must operate for years or even decades after deployment, particularly
    when some

    nodes are deployed in remote locations, making it difﬁcult to regularly meet the
    power

    maintenance requirements. A power failure causes the sensor to be unable to collect

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    7 of 25

    information correctly, or transmit data normally, and may even cause the failure
    of the

    entire agricultural sensor network. The energy consumption of wireless sensors
    is primarily

    attributable to monitoring, data transmission, and data reception. In the paper
    [67], the

    impact of power faults on WSNs is categorized into four groups: node, link, routing
    path,

    and global fault. A node fault may occur when the power supply falls below the
    node’s

    operating level. When a node’s power supply is insufﬁcient, its communication
    range is

    diminished, resulting in a link fault. When one or more nodes have link faults,
    the WSN

    becomes less efﬁcient, resulting in routing path faults. When node or link faults
    occur in

    key nodes, WSN communication is interrupted, resulting in a global fault.

    3.1.2. Soft Fault

    According to the fault scheme, sensor soft faults can be divided into drift faults,
    bias

    faults, accuracy decline faults, stuck faults, and spike faults [68,69].

    (1)

    Drift fault

    A drift fault refers to the measured value and the real value of the sensor changing

    with time. At this time, the output value of the sensor increases at a constant
    rate. Such

    faults must be diagnosed and restored in time, otherwise, signiﬁcant measurement
    errors

    occur [47]. In addition, drift faults cause severe damage to chemical sensors
    and biosensors

    if they are not readily detected at an early stage and need to be diagnosed early
    [70].

    (2)

    Bias fault

    A bias fault (offset fault) refers to a constant value added to the sensor measurement

    value, and the sensor output result deviates from the normal value [71]. When
    the manipulator

    sensor has a bias fault, it leads to poor regulation or tracking performance and
    even affects the

    stability of the control system. In addition, faulty data may lead to wrong decisions,
    making

    unnecessary component replacement or task termination in the system [72].

    (3)

    Stuck fault

    A stuck fault is a sudden sensor measurement error with a constant measurement

    value. This ﬂaw may vanish over time, but it will persist for a considerable time.
    The fault

    characteristics are evident and simple to identify [25]. Sometimes, the causes
    of a stuck

    fault are identical to those of other faults. For instance, a clogged pressure
    sensor causes a

    stuck fault, while a blocked ﬂow sensor causes a decline in accuracy [73].

    (4)

    Accuracy decline fault

    An accuracy decline fault indicates that the average value of the sensor measurement

    does not change, but the variance of the output value increases, resulting in
    a decline in

    measurement accuracy [74]. This fault frequently occurs in sensors, and early
    detection is

    crucial for monitoring. However, current research focuses primarily on drift faults,
    bias

    faults, and stuck faults, while accuracy decline fault research is scarce [75].

    (5)

    Spike fault

    A spike fault refers to a large amplitude spike in the measured value of the sensor,

    which often occurs in sensors. One of the reasons is the loose connection within
    the sensor

    node [76,77]. When a fault occurs in sensors, the system makes wrong decisions,
    such as

    spike faults in livestock and poultry houses that exceed the set environmental
    threshold,

    causing fans, heaters, and other equipment to be turned on or off.

    3.2. Characteristics of Sensor Faults

    (1)

    High spatial-temporal correlation

    The data collected by the sensor are a time series consisting of an ordered collection

    of measurement values collected at regular time intervals. Consequently, the inﬂuence
    of

    historical and future data should be considered during fault diagnosis. Moreover,
    since a

    large number of sensors of the same type are typically deployed in a particular
    area, there

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    8 of 25

    is a high spatial correlation between sensors, so other sensors should be consulted
    during

    the fault diagnosis process.

    (2)

    Frequent abnormal data

    Fault data include bias fault, drift fault, and so on, mainly caused by sensor
    faults or

    damage. The difference between abnormal data and fault data is small, but the
    duration is

    usually short. Because agricultural sensors are typically deployed in outdoor
    harsh envi-

    ronments, sudden changes in the environment can result in random changes, measurement,

    and recording errors, and thus make sensors produce outliers.

    (3)

    Different fault duration

    Due to extreme weather ﬂuctuations or the inﬂuence of other organisms, the sensor

    may experience a brief period of faults. When such an error occurs, the hardware
    and

    software of the sensor are normal, and the error is quickly rectiﬁed. Due to the
    deterioration

    of sensor hardware and software or insufﬁcient power, fault duration is lengthy,
    and

    most faults are permanent. Such faults cannot recover independently; fault diagnosis
    and

    recovery are required.

    4. Strategies for Sensor Fault Diagnosis

    Based on the different fault diagnosis methods performed in the Ag-IoT system

    structure, fault diagnosis is divided into centralized and distributed methods.

    4.1. Centralized Strategy

    The most common solution in agricultural sensor fault diagnosis is a centralized

    approach. The central node or base station diagnoses each sensor node’s condition.
    The

    central node’s limitless resources (such as batteries and computing power) lengthen
    the

    lifespan of agricultural WSNs [78]. A trained fault diagnosis model is stored
    in the central

    node that periodically sends requests to the network to detect the state of the
    entire sensor

    network and diagnoses and locates faulty sensors after analyzing agricultural
    sensor data.

    Lau et al. [65] proposed a centralized fault detection method for WSNs based on
    the Naive

    Bayes framework to detect sensor battery issues; the diagnosis process was not
    performed

    in each sensor node, thereby reducing battery load. Salah et al. [79] proposed
    a centralized

    policy sensor fault scheme based on SVM that performed fault diagnosis at the
    cluster head

    and utilized fewer sensor resources.

    This method has minimal hardware requirements for agricultural sensor nodes, re-

    quires no additional computing and memory resources, and extends the sensor’s
    service

    life. However, a large amount of information is sent to the central node, which
    causes

    network congestion and slows down detection speed; due to fault diagnosis at the
    central

    node, it is difﬁcult to meet real-time requirements; in the process of data transmission
    to

    the central node or base station via multiple hops, the pressure on the sink node
    increases,

    consuming the sink node’s resources.

    4.2. Distributed Strategy

    Due to the small number of base stations in agricultural scenarios, weak signals,
    and

    low network coverage, agricultural sensor data cannot be transmitted to the central
    node or

    base station in some areas, making it challenging to implement centralized fault
    diagnosis.

    In addition, the centralized fault diagnosis strategy increases network trafﬁc,
    resulting

    in network congestion and an inability to meet real-time fault diagnosis requirements.

    The distributed fault diagnosis strategy effectively resolves this issue. Distributed
    fault

    diagnosis is located between sensor nodes, eliminating the need to send agricultural
    sensor

    data to a central node or base station for diagnosis and satisfying real-time
    speciﬁcations.

    Sana et al. [80] proposed a distributed sensor fault diagnosis system based on
    a machine

    learning algorithm, which implemented fault detection in the sensor and performed
    the

    fault diagnosis on the central node, thereby ensuring the real-time performance
    of the fault

    diagnosis and reducing the number of calculations performed on the sensor.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    9 of 25

    The greater the number of decisions the sensor node makes, the less information

    is transmitted to the central node, thereby accelerating the detection rate. However,
    the

    hardware requirements of the sensor node are high, and the node for fault diagnosis
    requires

    speciﬁc memory, computing, and battery resources. The memory resources of wireless

    sensor nodes are on the order of kilobytes, and the operation speed is on the
    order of MHz.

    Conversely, due to the limited resources carried by the sensor nodes, the fault
    diagnosis

    method must meet the requirements of being lightweight and having high performance,

    allowing for fast and accurate diagnosis despite limited computing and storage
    resources

    without excessive battery consumption. Data-driven fault detection methods require

    fewer resources than model-driven ones [81]. Some researchers [82] investigated
    using

    lightweight fault diagnosis algorithms to reduce sensor resource consumption during
    the

    fault diagnosis procedure.

    5. Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Sensor Faults

    The purpose of sensor fault diagnosis is to detect the fault data in the sensor,
    and

    restore or isolate the faulty sensor so that the sensor can ﬁnally provide normal
    data to

    the user. Traditional fault diagnosis techniques mainly rely on manual judgment,
    and

    the experience and expertise of engineers determine the accuracy of judgment.
    However,

    with advances in science and technology, agriculture has entered the 4.0 era,
    and the data

    collected by sensors are multi-dimensional and large-scale, and the monitoring
    objects

    often have coupling relationships and affect each other. Relying only on manual
    machine

    fault diagnosis struggles to meet the current needs in terms of accuracy and real-time.
    In

    factory farming scenarios, users want an automated way to reduce labor costs and
    improve

    diagnostic accuracy. The introduction of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) technology
    is

    expected to achieve this goal. IFD refers to the application of machine learning
    theories

    (such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVMs), and
    deep

    neural networks (DNNs)) in machine fault diagnosis [83], adaptively learning machine

    fault diagnosis knowledge from the collected data, automatically establishing
    a relationship

    model between the collected data and the health state of the machine, and realizing
    the

    automation and intelligence of sensor fault diagnosis technology. This section
    divides the

    sensor fault diagnosis technology into three methods: model-based, artiﬁcial intelligence-

    based, and deep learning diagnosis-based, as shown in Figure 4. Relevant sensor
    fault

    diagnosis approaches are shown in Table 3.

    5.1. Model-Based Fault Diagnosis Methods

    The model-based fault diagnosis method was proposed by Beard of the Massachusetts

    Institute of Technology in 1971 [16] and refers to using knowledge of the system’s
    structure,

    behavior, and function to diagnose the fault of the system [84]. Based on the
    model,

    fault diagnosis methods are divided into three types: state estimation, equivalent
    space,

    and parameter estimation [85]. The approach consists of two main steps: residual
    error

    generation and residual error evaluation. This diagnosis method requires understanding

    the mechanism of the research object and establishing a mathematical model, using
    the

    system’s structure, behavior, or function to simulate the model, and then making
    a decision

    based on the difference between the actual measured signal and the model measured
    signal.

    By generating residual signals to achieve fault diagnosis [86], the occurrence
    of a fault

    can be detected by evaluating whether the resulting residual exceeds a threshold.
    Vasso

    et al. [87] designed a model-based distributed fault diagnosis framework for detecting
    and

    isolating multi-sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.
    The

    adaptive threshold framework ensures the proposed method’s robustness against
    modeling

    uncertainties and measurement noise. Zhang et al. [88] proved that a Principal
    Component

    Analysis (PCA)-based sensor fault detection method is less efﬁcient in fault detection
    under

    minor deviation fault conditions. Yu et al. [89] proposed a model-based fault
    diagnosis

    scheme that uses open-circuit voltage residuals and capacity residuals to deduce
    fault

    values of voltage and current sensors for battery fault diagnosis. Yan et al.
    [90] proposed a

    Cp_PLV model combining an unsupervised learning method with change point recognition.

    Experiments show that the predictive effect of the model is good and can fault
    diagnose

    the sensor in complex working environments.

    Due to the fact that the model-based fault diagnosis method employs fundamental

    knowledge for fault diagnosis, it has improved fault interpretability. It can
    also meet

    the real-time requirements of agricultural sensor fault diagnosis. In practice,
    however,

    the model is uncertain, and it is difﬁcult to establish a model that corresponds
    to other

    agricultural sensors. It is challenging to ensure fault diagnosis accuracy with
    an unmatched

    model, which cannot detect the fault value and is not universal.

    5.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence-Based Fault Diagnosis Methods

    With the widespread adoption of Ag-IoT, the uncertainty and complexity of the
    sensor

    system have gradually grown, as has the difficulty of developing an accurate mathematical

    model. The artificial intelligence-based fault diagnosis method treats the system
    as a black

    box, does not need to understand the structure and principle of the system and
    the precise

    mathematical model of the diagnostic object, and uses a large amount of sensor
    system data for

    fault diagnosis [91]. The method relies primarily on real-time or historical data
    and comprises

    artificial intelligence algorithms and statistical data processing. The primary
    benefit of this

    method is that it does not require a precise system model, and it has been utilized
    successfully

    for agricultural sensor fault diagnosis. Common fault detection techniques based
    on artificial

    intelligence include statistical analysis, expert systems, and machine learning.

    5.2.1. Statistical Analysis Methods

    The statistical analysis method primarily involves a sensor’s randomly distributed

    data collection. The sensor is deemed defective when the probability of the data
    instance

    generated by the model is extremely low. The primary components of this method
    are time

    series analysis and multivariate statistical analysis.

    The time series analysis method examines the characteristics of sensor data from
    a

    time series perspective, estimates the predicted value of the sensor data, and
    determines

    whether the sensor is faulty by comparing the difference between the predicted
    value and

    the actual value. Hao et al. [92] designed a module based on time series theory
    to detect

    sensor faults in the navigation system of autonomous mobile agricultural robots.
    Simple

    and effective, the time series method was able to explain the relevant results
    intuitively.

    However, agricultural sensors are typically deployed outside, where the environment

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    11 of 25

    constantly changes, causing the sensor data to ﬂuctuate greatly and be prone to
    error. Due

    to the difﬁculty of a single sensor explaining the complexity of agricultural
    environments,

    multivariate statistical analysis methods that combine data from multiple sensors
    for fault

    diagnosis are crucial. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [14], Partial Least
    Squares

    Regression (PLS) [93], and PCA [94] are the three multivariate statistical analysis
    methods.

    After establishing the probability statistics model, the model can effectively
    detect sen-

    sor system faults. The model is highly interpretable; however, when using time
    correlation

    to detect faulty data, a sudden change in the data distribution will reduce the
    time correla-

    tion and make sensor fault diagnosis more difﬁcult. The statistical analysis method
    has

    the following drawbacks: the nonparametric statistical model struggles to meet
    real-time

    requirements; the parametric statistical model is ineffective in practical applications
    due to

    a lack of data distribution knowledge in the sensor system; the histogram does
    not take

    into account the relationship between multivariate data and only applies to univariate
    data.

    5.2.2. Expert System Methods

    The method based on an expert system is used to diagnose faults based on the experi-

    ence of experts and maintenance personnel involved in producing agricultural sensors.
    It is

    primarily divided into rule-based expert systems and expert systems with fuzzy
    reasoning.

    An expert system is a structured knowledge system that imitates human experts
    to solve

    problems in a particular domain. Expert system components include a knowledge
    base, a

    rule base, an inference engine, a human-computer interface, and an explanation
    facility [95].

    The knowledge base is the key to ensuring the expert system’s accuracy, which
    comprises

    the operators’ theoretical and professional knowledge. The system operates as
    follows: the

    data to be diagnosed is input through a human-computer interface, the inference
    engine

    matches the current known conditions, information, and rules of the knowledge
    base, and

    the user is then presented with the conclusion of the matching rules [96,97].
    Prasenjit [98]

    proposed a WSN fault node classiﬁcation and management scheme based on fuzzy rules,

    which detected the sensor fault state and divided it into various categories to
    guarantee

    the reusability of fault nodes. Pooja et al. [99] proposed a hardware fault diagnosis
    model

    for sensor nodes based on a fuzzy inference system with three inputs, developed
    27 fuzzy

    rules based on the status of the transmitter, receiver, and battery, and categorized
    the

    nodes as normal nodes, end nodes, and dead nodes. This scheme’s detection accuracy
    and

    misdiagnosis rate have been enhanced.

    A mathematical model is not required by the expert system-based technique for

    determining what is wrong. It employs the rules and information we already possess
    to

    determine what is wrong with an agricultural sensor system. It has outstanding
    advantages

    in the application of nonlinear systems because it has good performance and strong
    learning

    ability in dealing with known faults. Nevertheless, there are still things that
    could be

    improved with this method: As more and more types of sensors are utilized, the
    complexity

    of the sensor system must increase. This makes it difﬁcult to determine why the
    sensors

    are malfunctioning. The current expert systems for fault diagnosis lack universality
    and

    adaptability, and each system operates independently. This is extremely wasteful.
    Users

    are interested in the location and timing of agricultural sensor failures.

    5.2.3. Machine Learning Methods

    There is no simple correspondence between fault types and fault characteristics
    due to

    the complexity and unpredictability of sensor systems. The fault diagnosis method
    based

    on machine learning can train support vector machine (SVM), artiﬁcial neural network

    (NN), and other machine learning algorithms using normal data and fault data,
    and then

    diagnose the fault of sensors.

    SVM is a machine learning algorithm that solves binary classification problems
    [100];

    sensor fault diagnosis is based on small samples. Consequently, the SVM model
    is ideally

    suited for sensor fault diagnosis and has been widely implemented in the field
    [101,102]. Yang

    et al. [103] divided multiple fault combinations according to the correlation
    of faults. They

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    12 of 25

    developed multiple SVM models based on these fault combinations to combat the
    misdiagnosis

    caused by insufficient and unreliable training data in traditional SVM models.
    Each SVM model

    assigned positive and negative labels to fault samples, corrected various label
    combinations

    using DS theory, and then determined the fault type. Although the fault identification
    accuracy

    of this scheme has been enhanced, the DS-theory-based correction rate must be
    improved. Deng

    et al. [104] proposed OS-LSSVM for sensor fault detection, which solved the problem
    of LS-SVM

    lacking sparsity, enabled online fault diagnosis, and increased calculation speed.
    The SVM

    method primarily solves the quadratic programming problem; however, the calculation
    method

    based on quadratic programming restricts real-time performance and is unsuitable
    for online

    fault diagnosis. Han et al. [105] proposed an LS-SVM model that reduced the computational

    complexity by transforming the quadratic programming problem into a linear equation.
    The

    model’s execution time was reduced by 36.7% compared to the SVM model, and the
    diagnostic

    accuracy was also enhanced. In addition, Liu et al. [106] proposed a KNN-FSVM
    fault diagnosis

    scheme, which trained SVM by only selecting boundary data, thereby reducing the
    need for

    computing and storage resources. This was a solution to the problem that the computing
    time

    of SVM increases exponentially with the amount of data, as do the requirements
    for computing

    and storage resources.

    While traditional SVM models can diagnose systems with a small number of data
    samples,

    as sensor performance becomes more complex, the types of sensor faults increase,
    and the

    accuracy of the classification model decreases. Therefore, the SVM-based fault
    diagnosis method

    is not suitable for use alone in the current diversified agricultural production
    mode.

    ANN is a mathematical model that simulates the mechanism by which the nervous

    system of the human brain processes complex information based on the fundamental
    prin-

    ciples of neural networks in biology [107]. ANN is a nonlinear model primarily
    composed

    of neurons that are incorporated into three layers, referred to as the input layer,
    hidden

    layer, and output layer, with the ability to simulate any continuous nonlinear
    function

    and learn from samples, expressing the learned fault diagnosis knowledge with
    neural

    network connection weights, which has been utilized in the fault diagnosis of
    complex

    systems [108,109]. Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) [110] is currently the
    most

    widely used neural network model. Researchers created it to address the challenges
    of

    multi-layer neural networks. Hu et al. [111] employed BPNN for temperature sensor

    fault diagnosis. The model selected the most recent local data, reducing the computation

    required and enabling online detection. In order to eliminate data noise and improve
    the

    accuracy of neural network fault diagnosis, Shi et al. [112] incorporated wavelet
    denoising

    technology into the BPNN, which enhanced the BPNN’s fault detection rate. Guo
    et al. [113]

    proposed an EFMSAE-LSTM method for predicting the time series of mechanical failures,

    which can accurately predict the failure time series of most key mechanical components.

    Mariam et al. [114] performed fault diagnosis for HVAC sensors using a self-associative

    neural network and compared this technique to principal component analysis. Not
    only

    was the diagnostic accuracy of this method signiﬁcantly enhanced, but it could
    also diag-

    nose multiple sensors simultaneously. Precision agriculture is characterized by
    massive

    normal agricultural data and small sample fault data. The extreme imbalance of
    these data

    renders the neural network’s fault diagnosis method less stable; The parameters
    of the

    model need to be adjusted repeatedly to meet the requirements of the practical
    application,

    which requires good model training experience.

    Although machine learning-based fault diagnosis methods have high time and money

    costs in network training, they also require relatively large training data samples.
    However,

    considering the practical application of sensors in agriculture, the data collected
    is suscep-

    tible to many factors, such as weather, region, season, and changes in the growth
    stage

    of animals and plants. Especially for the current large-scale and industrialized
    farming

    pattern, it is difﬁcult or even impossible to obtain accurate system models. Small
    changes

    in the system can lead to poor failure detection response. Therefore, compared
    with the

    fault diagnosis methods based on models and expert systems, the fault diagnosis
    methods

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    13 of 25

    based on machine learning have good generalization ability and wider applicability,
    which

    are suitable for application in the era of diversiﬁed and integrated agriculture
    4.0.

    5.3. Deep-Learning-Based Fault Diagnosis Method

    With the advancement of hardware and algorithms and the exponential growth of

    data, fault diagnosis has shifted from machine learning to deep learning [115].
    Deep learn-

    ing, a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence, is the newest data analysis and image
    processing

    technology. Compared with traditional statistical learning models, deep learning
    models

    have a stronger ability to extract underlying information from data. The structure
    of deep

    learning models is usually formed by multi-layer neural networks, which can be
    ﬂexibly

    changed to meet different practical needs. In addition, multiple layers of data
    processing

    units are assembled to form a deep architecture. It has powerful learning capabilities
    and

    can extract features automatically from input data. Hierarchical features are
    represented

    by low-level features, which can efﬁciently and quickly solve complex problems
    and have

    good portability, making them suitable for sensor fault diagnosis. Autoencoders
    (AEs),

    Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional

    Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current deep learning models for sensor fault diagnosis.

    5.3.1. Autoencoder (AE)

    An AE is an unsupervised learning neural network that uses the back-propagation

    algorithm to make the output value equal to the input value [116], which can effectively

    extract low-dimensional data features. Encoding and decoding are the two components

    of an AE. The encoder compresses the input into a representation of latent space,
    and the

    decoder reconstructs the information from the latent space representation. With
    the advent

    of deep learning, researchers have created additional AE model types. For instance,
    to

    extract abstract features from data, several AEs are stacked to form a Stacked
    Autoencoder

    (SAE), and a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) was developed to improve the anti-noise

    capability of neural networks [117].

    Under the premise of training on small data samples, AE can achieve efﬁcient fault

    diagnosis when combined with other classiﬁcation methods [118]. The use of AE
    for fault

    diagnosis has received considerable attention in recent years. Luo et al. [119]
    designed an

    AE-distributed fault diagnosis system with only three layers of the network, which
    was

    used for fault diagnosis in sensors, and the model was trained in the cloud to
    address the

    issue that deep learning methods consume a great deal of computing and communication

    resources. Jia et al. [120] proposed a normalized sparse AE model for intelligent
    fault

    diagnosis, learning various meaningful features from the input signal. The translation
    in-

    variant features were obtained in the feature layer, and then the fault was identiﬁed
    in the

    output layer, and the accuracy rate of the model test reached 99.92 percent. In
    addition, due

    to the model training phase, AE automatically extracts non-fault-related features,
    which

    hinders fault diagnosis performance. Wang et al. [121] proposed a supervised SAE
    model

    capable of extracting fault-related deep features and conﬁguring ﬁne-tuned network
    initial

    parameters. This method improved classiﬁcation precision with fewer iterations.
    The local

    minimum problem exists in the traditional AE method for fault diagnosis. Through
    batch

    regression, hyperparameter optimization, and other techniques, the model can be
    made to

    closely resemble the actual working conditions of the sensor, which is advantageous
    for

    resolving this issue. Mallak et al. [122] propose a two-stage fault diagnosis
    method that

    uses an LSTM autoencoder to perform a separate fault detection stage in advance.
    This

    method can effectively catch rare faults.

    AE has the advantages of strong learning ability, simple structure, and easy training.

    However, traditional AE only uses a single-layer encoder for feature extraction,
    which

    struggles to extract deep features and has limited data processing capabilities.
    As the

    modern agricultural production process gradually presents the characteristics
    of modular-

    ization and specialization, it is suitable for application in distributed fault
    diagnosis and

    processing small samples of univariate data.

    5.3.2. Deep Belief Network (DBN)

    A DBN is a probabilistic generative model of multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines

    (RBM). Each RBM consists of only two layers of neurons, the visible layer and
    the hidden

    layer, which are connected by a symmetrical weighted connection matrix [123,124].
    The

    visible layer inputs training data, whereas the hidden layer extracts features.
    In each RBM,

    the data vector is used to infer the hidden layer, which is then used as the data
    vector

    for the subsequent layer to improve the probability variation lower bound of the
    training

    data. As feature extraction is a crucial step in the diagnosis process, DBN employs
    an

    unsupervised greedy layer-by-layer method to obtain high-level feature representation,

    which can effectively eliminate the complexity and uncertainty introduced by manual

    feature extraction and enhance the intelligence of fault diagnosis [125,126].
    In addition,

    DBN has the capacity to manage high-dimensional and nonlinear data, thereby resolving

    the issues of data dimensional disaster and inadequate diagnostic capability.

    Since methods like SVM and ANN can only detect faulty data but not faulty sensors
    [127],

    Mandal et al. [128] proposed a method based on DBN and the generalized likelihood
    ratio test.

    DBN was utilized to classify fault data and normal data, the faulty sensor was
    identified by

    the maximum deviation between the fault data and the average value of the normal
    data, and

    the quantity of fault data and the generalized likelihood ratio test determined
    the fault mode.

    However, this method only detected faults when the signal exceeded the threshold;
    therefore,

    other methods are required to detect faults when the signal was below the threshold.
    Due to

    the loss of potentially valuable information in the original data caused by the
    layer-by-layer

    feature compression of the DBN model, Wang et al. [129] employed the strategy
    of repeatedly

    stacking the original data during the training phase in order to fully extract
    the valuable

    information by extending the DBN model. Each RBM was trained with the original
    data

    so that the extracted features were highly correlated with the original data,
    and potentially

    valuable information was preserved. Compared to the conventional DBN model, the
    accuracy

    rate has been enhanced.

    DBNs can extract advanced features from large amounts of data and directly use

    raw signals to build end-to-end intelligent diagnostic models to reduce reliance
    on expert

    experience and known knowledge. They can fuse the time domain and frequency domain

    characteristics of each sensor signal and apply this to DBN training, which can
    not only

    realize fault diagnosis but also diagnose fault types. They are suitable for applications
    in

    advanced composite sensor systems.

    5.3.3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

    An RNN is a type of neural network that processes sequence data. Its most distin-

    guishing characteristic is that the output of neurons is transmitted to the input
    of itself or

    other neurons. Its properties can connect the nodes between hidden layers, and
    the input

    of the hidden layer incorporates the input of the input layer and the output of
    the hidden

    layer at the time of its creation. This concatenated neural network structure
    is appropriate

    for time series data and can preserve data dependencies [130]. Later, Hochreiter
    et al. [131]

    proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve the traditional RNN model
    to

    address the issue that RNNs are not good at long-term memory.

    Hochreiter et al.

    (2022) [131]

    Due to the fact that sensor data are collected at various time points with a high

    temporal correlation, the RNN model has been extensively studied in sensor fault
    diagnosis.

    Azzam et al. [132] utilized RNN to model sensor nodes, node dynamics, and sensor
    node

    coupling to achieve sensor node fault diagnosis. This method had a lower early
    false alarm

    rate than the Kalman ﬁlter. Lei et al. [133] adopted LSTM for wind turbine sensor
    fault

    diagnosis. The method can be extended to multi-sensor fault diagnosis through
    data fusion.

    In addition, the method was robust under limited data conditions, and its performance
    was

    superior to SVM and other approaches. Long et al. [134] proposed an RNN-based
    satellite

    sensor fault diagnosis scheme. They combined the linear parameter change method
    with

    the based model method to improve the robustness of fault diagnosis and the accuracy
    of

    the scheme. To solve the overﬁtting problem of deep neural networks in fault diagnosis,

    Xia et al. [135] implemented dropout in the LSTM model to prevent overﬁtting and
    enhance

    the training process’s efﬁcacy.

    Since deep learning automatically extracts features from the original data, there
    is

    no mapping between the extracted features and the fault mechanism. Although the
    deep

    learning model is suitable for resolving the big data characteristics of large-scale
    sensors,

    its training speed is slow and consumes computing resources. Therefore, the deep
    learning

    model is not typically executed directly on sensors but on edge nodes or the cloud.

    5.3.4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

    CNNs are a signiﬁcant subﬁeld of deep learning. A CNN has an input layer, a

    convolution layer, a pooling layer, a full connection layer, and an output layer.
    It is ca-

    pable of auto-extracting features and is both robust and generalizable. CNN is
    currently

    used primarily for feature extraction of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
    image

    sequences [136]. Still, because CNN has the characteristics of lattice and convolution
    opera-

    tions and is suitable for multisensor data processing, some researchers have introduced

    CNN to the ﬁeld of fault diagnosis [137]. Debasish et al. [138] proposed a CNN
    fault

    diagnosis method to diagnose multisensor faults at the same calculation cost to
    reduce

    model training time and cost. Sun et al. [139] proposed a CNN-RF sensor fault
    diagnosis

    method, which converted the original sensor signal into a grey matrix image, and
    the CNN

    is used to automatically extract the features of the gray matrix image, reducing
    the loss

    of effective information and improving the accuracy Muneer et al. [140,141] proposed
    an

    attention-based deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture to predict
    the

    RUL of turbofan engines. They used multivariate time information to extract features,

    which signiﬁcantly improved the prediction performance of the model. Zhang et
    al. [142]

    replaced the conventionally used fully connected layers in traditional CNN with
    a multi-

    layer pool classiﬁer, thereby reducing the number of network parameters and the
    risk of

    overﬁtting. The method performed a fault diagnosis on the acceleration sensor,
    with high

    fault-diagnosis accuracy and low computing resource consumption.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 2528

    17 of 25

    CNN’s ability to process two-dimensional and three-dimensional image data is its

    primary beneﬁt. Muneer et al. [141] proposed a data-driven predictive model based
    on

    deep neural networks (DNNs), using sliding time window technology to prepare data,

    which does not require prior knowledge of prediction or signal processing. Currently,

    research in fault diagnosis focuses primarily on machinery, particularly rotating
    machinery,

    while research on sensor fault diagnosis is limited. Some researchers attempt
    to convert

    one-dimensional sensor data into a two-dimensional form, but this may destroy
    the spatial

    correlation of the original data and result in the loss of some error-related
    data. CNN is

    also suitable for processing large sample sizes but has a problem with overﬁtting
    small

    sample fault data.

    The aforementioned methods for fault diagnosis are highly accurate, but each has
    advan-

    tages and disadvantages. The model-based method for fault diagnosis is highly
    interpretable.

    It does not require a large amount of data, but the model is complex and highly
    professional,

    which is unsuitable for daily agricultural applications. The fault diagnosis method
    based

    on artificial intelligence does not require an accurate mathematical model, and
    the accuracy

    of the diagnosis is high. However, the model has high requirements for calculation,
    stor-

    age, and other resources and requires a large amount of historical data. However,
    In daily

    agricultural activities, many quantity monitoring systems tend to collect and
    store real-time

    data, and insufficient amounts of historical data may reduce the accuracy of the
    model. The

    fault diagnosis method based on deep learning overcomes the flaw of the manual
    feature

    extraction method based on machine learning, and the model accuracy is higher;
    however,

    the method for fault diagnosis based on deep learning has flaws. To ensure the
    accuracy of

    the fault diagnosis model, it must be debugged and simulated multiple times, which
    wastes a

    significant amount of human resources and requires more resources such as computation
    and

    storage. Table 4 displays the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

    5.4. Edge Computing-Based Fault Diagnosis Method

    Edge computing is a new computing model that deploys computing and storage

    resources (such as Cloudlets, and fog nodes) to networks closer to mobile devices
    or sensors.

    IoT-based edge computing falls into three main categories: local devices adapted
    to speciﬁc

    deﬁnitions and good targets, local data centers providing signiﬁcant data processing
    and

    storage capacity, and regional data centers closer to the data source. In response
    to the

    limitations of agricultural land, edge computing can be applied to work over long
    distances,

    and the processing of data generated by sensors through edge computing can improve

    response times, reduce the amount of communication transmitted to the cloud, and
    avoid

    latency problems in data processing [143].

    Control monitoring of data using edge computing allows data consistency and in-

    tegrity analysis, identiﬁcation, and removal of erroneous data. When an edge device
    fails,

    the edge computing system can notify the user which component is at fault, which
    facilitates

    sensor fault detection. Sun et al. proposed a real-time detection algorithm based
    on edge

    computing and cloud computing to improve the average repair time by pre-processing
    the

    original video data when performing fault diagnosis on video surveillance systems
    [144].

    Li et al. point out that sensor-based data collection systems suffer from signiﬁcant
    latency

    and data redundancy, and edge computing is often applied closer to the source
    of data

    generation, i.e., data processing is performed locally, sharing the reduced data
    redundancy

    and solving latency problems [145]. Since edge computing will control in real-time,
    monitor

    the process of data processing, and send the analysis results to the cloud, it
    is convenient for

    managers to view the working status of sensors in time and make judgments on whether

    the sensors produce faults. To solve some of the problems of wireless sensor data
    col-

    lection, wireless sensors are combined with edge computing to establish data collection

    algorithms. In wireless sensor networks, through edge servers, invalid data is
    ﬁltered,

    sensing parameters are obtained, and the collected data is transmitted to the
    cloud or edge

    servers to improve sensor networks’ intelligence and computing capability [146],
    laying the

    foundation for its fault diagnosis. Akhtar et al. proposed that the data distribution
    of edge

    computing was heterogeneous and required distributed data processing and storage.
    On

    the basis of edge computing, they proposed High-Performance Computing (HPC), which

    can identify data anomalies by performing quality checks at the edge layer, which
    can help

    troubleshoot sensors to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. Users can view, analyze,
    and

    operate the data stored in the cloud and use the machine learning tools stored
    in the cloud

    database to analyze the data and make judgments when the sensor is faulty [147].

    6. Challenges and Future Development

    Smart agriculture with Agriculture 4.0 at its core has become the current focus
    of

    agricultural development on a global scale. With the development of IoT, big data,
    wireless

    sensing, and other technologies, intelligent equipment in agriculture continue
    to increase,

    the types of faults are becoming more complex and diverse, and the demand for
    Ag-IoT-

    based fault diagnosis technology is rising. Some fault detection methods based
    on a single

    target can no longer meet the demand. First, it is necessary to consider the economic

    beneﬁts and feasibility of the diagnostic system for farmers and try to ensure
    the system’s

    simplicity while ensuring that the diagnosis is correct. At the same time, the
    amount of

    information in the agricultural ﬁeld is huge, which is a great test for the stability
    of any

    system. The main goal of future fault diagnosis technology is to achieve early
    detection

    and treatment of sensor faults while ensuring system stability. Therefore, we
    provide a

    summary of the fault diagnosis areas that will receive future attention.

    6.1. Edge Computing

    Intelligent fault diagnosis requires high real-time performance and hardware resources.

    Practical issues such as network unavailability, full bandwidth, or insufﬁcient
    sensor

    computing and storage resources are frequently encountered in agricultural scenarios,

    making it difﬁcult for centralized and distributed fault diagnosis strategies
    to meet sensor

    fault diagnosis requirements. Edge computing is a remedy for the aforementioned
    issues.

    Edge computing allows faster response times and more secure data transmission
    and

    processing than other sensor fault diagnosis methods. At the same time, edge computing

    can be combined with deep learning algorithms to reduce model training time and
    make

    sensor fault diagnosis more efﬁcient [148]. Edge computing transfers a portion
    of the

    central server’s computing and storage resources to edge nodes and collects sensor
    data

    on the edge computing platform to develop fault diagnosis models. Unmanned plant

    protection machines and inspection robots are two examples of agricultural equipment
    that

    transports substantial resources. Consequently, using such equipment as a platform
    for

    edge computing does not increase costs and satisﬁes the requirements for fault
    diagnosis.

    6.2. Satellite Communication

    Few base stations and low network coverage are characteristics of Ag-IoT, which

    prevents the wireless sensor node from sending data to the central node, using
    the cen-

    tralized fault diagnosis strategy, and sending fault information to the central
    node using

    the distributed fault diagnosis strategy. In addition, agricultural sensors are
    frequently

    deployed in harsh environments, and environmental factors such as sudden changes
    can

    cause network disruptions and other problems. With the proposal of Starlink, people
    began

    to investigate the commercial application of satellite Internet and the use of
    satellite com-

    munication to solve the problem of no network in sensor deployment areas [149].
    Satellite

    communication has the advantages of long communication distance, being unrestricted
    by

    natural conditions, and having high stability, which guarantees the network’s
    continuous

    availability in sensor fault diagnosis.

    6.3. Hybrid Fault Diagnosis Model

    The sensor system in Ag-IoT is frequently dynamic, uncertain, open, vulnerable
    to attack,

    and concurrently susceptible to multiple faults. If only a single fault diagnosis
    method is

    used, issues such as low accuracy, poor generalization ability, and incomplete
    diagnosis arise,

    making it difficult to achieve accurate diagnosis results. The method for fault
    diagnosis based

    on the fusion of multiple technologies can be studied. Combining a model-based
    approach

    and deep learning can enhance a diagnostic system’s robustness, accuracy, and
    dependability

    while decreasing uncertainty. This method can not only expand the fault ability
    based on

    deep learning but also fully utilize the interpretability advantage of the model-based
    method,

    which aids technicians in understanding the fault type and origin.

    7. Conclusions

    This paper reviews fault diagnosis technology in the context of artiﬁcial intelligence

    technology and big data. The concept of sensors and sensor networks in Ag-IoT
    are

    introduced, and common sensor fault types and fault diagnosis strategies in Ag-IoT
    are

    listed. In addition, the research and application status of three sensor fault
    diagnosis

    technologies are summarized: model-based, artiﬁcial intelligence-based, and deep
    learning-

    based. The methods are compared and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

    Through the analysis of this review, the following conclusions are drawn, and
    suggestions

    for future work are put forward.

    (1) Presently, sensors are usually deployed in harsh environments, which are extremely

    vulnerable to environmental impact, resulting in inaccurate data collection and
    irreversible

    impact on sensors. In the future, sensors will be further developed, less affected
    by

    the environment, and can use limited resources to work for a long time; The output

    format codes between different sensors have developed from the original disunity
    to the

    standardized format.

    (2) Deep learning has unique advantages, although the research in the ﬁeld of
    sensor

    fault diagnosis is still in its infancy, it has a good development prospect. It
    is necessary

    to improve the system’s robustness to meet the changes in the conditions in practical

    applications.

    (3) The commonly used single-fault diagnosis methods often encounter many prob-

    lems: resource limitation problems, data transmission problems, node optimization
    prob-

    lems, data security problems, and so on. In the future, fault diagnosis methods
    based on

    the integration of multiple technologies can be studied, such as adding edge computing

    and satellite communication and combining expert systems and deep learning to
    shorten

    the training time by using known rules through transfer learning, which could
    improve the

    accuracy of sensor fault diagnosis and reduce the frequency of faults to ensure
    the stability

    and reliability of intelligent agricultural measurement and control systems.

    \ in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nHealthcare facilities\
    \ in modern age are key challenge especially in developing countries where remote\
    \ areas face lack of high-\nquality hospitals and medical experts. As artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence has revolutionized various ﬁelds of life, health has also beneﬁted\n\
    from it. Te existing architecture of store-and-forward method of conventional\
    \ telemedicine is facing some problems, some of\nwhich are the need for a local\
    \ health center with dedicated staﬀ, need for medical equipment to prepare patient\
    \ reports, time\nconstraint of 24–48 hours in receiving diagnosis and medication\
    \ details from a medical expert in a main hospital, cost of local\nhealth centers,\
    \ and need for Wi-Fi connection. In this paper, we introduce a novel and intelligent\
    \ healthcare system that is based\non modern technologies like Internet of things\
    \ (IoT) and machine learning. Tis system is intelligent enough to sense and process\n\
    a patient’s data through a medical decision support system. Tis system is low-cost\
    \ solution for the people of remote areas; they\ncan use it to ﬁnd out whether\
    \ they are suﬀering from a serious health issue and cure it accordingly by contacting\
    \ near hospitals.\nTe results of the experiments also show that the proposed system\
    \ is eﬃcient and intelligent enough to provide health facilities.\nTe results\
    \ presented in this paper are the proof of the concept.\n1. Introduction\nInternet\
    \ of things (IoT) is a network in which many devices\nare connected, and these\
    \ devices can communicate by\ncomputer network [1]. By this worldwide network,\
    \ we can\nget information through sensors which relate to it. By using\ncomputer\
    \ network, we can access this information anywhere\nin this world. Internet of\
    \ things can connect physical objects\nto Internet and can provide opportunity\
    \ of building systems\nwhich are based on various technologies such as near ﬁeld\n\
    communication (NFC) and wireless sensor network (WSN).\nIn wireless sensor network,\
    \ sensors sense the environment\nand send information to base station.\nIoT has\
    \ diﬀerent methodologies such as smart dustbin,\nmonitoring environment, IoT based\
    \ irrigation system, smart\nhealthcare system, and traﬃc control. In healthcare\
    \ system,\nIoT brings gadget for monitoring health [2]. Health data can\nbe accessed\
    \ with the help of IoT by using sensors. Healthcare\nis a system which is used\
    \ to improve health and help in\ntreating diseases [3].\nHealth related issues/complications\
    \ are increasing day\nby day, among which lung- and heart-related issues are top-\n\
    listed. Health can be monitored by wireless technology,\nwhich is a modern concept.\
    \ In wireless health monitoring\nsystems, diﬀerent technologies are used, including\
    \ wearable\nsensors, portable remote health system, wireless commu-\nnications,\
    \ and expert systems. Life is precious; even a single\nlife is also valuable,\
    \ but due to lack of health facilities,\nawareness about diseases, and proper\
    \ access to healthcare\nsystems, people are dropping their lives. In all situations,\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) helps in the indication of diseases\nand treatment of\
    \ patients [4].\nIn IoT healthcare system, there exit wireless systems in\nwhich\
    \ diﬀerent applications and sensors are attached to\nHindawi\nScientiﬁc Programming\n\
    Volume 2020, Article ID 8836927, 15 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8836927\n\
    patients, information is obtained, and this information is\nforwarded to a doctor\
    \ or specialist through an expert system\n[5]. Medical devices for Internet of\
    \ things (MD-IoT) are\nremotely accessed, where devices are connected to the In-\n\
    ternet and sensors, actuators, and other communication\ndevices can monitor patient\
    \ health [6]. Trough these de-\nvices, the patient information and data are transmitted\
    \ by\nthe expert system via gateway onto a secured cloud based\nplatform where\
    \ the information is stored and can be\nanalyzed.\nIn developing countries like\
    \ Pakistan, telemedicine is\nused to handle health issues. Telemedicine refers\
    \ to the\npractice of caring for patients remotely when the provider\nand patient\
    \ are not physically present with each other.\nTelemedicine is simply deﬁned as\
    \ “the remote delivery of\nhealthcare services.” Although telemedicine brings\
    \ with it\nmany beneﬁts, it has some downsides as well. Providers,\npayers, and\
    \ policymakers alike know that there are some\ngray areas that are diﬃcult to\
    \ keep up with. While the ﬁeld\nwill grow exponentially over the next decade,\
    \ it will bring\nwith it both practical and technological challenges.\n1.1. Unclear\
    \ Policies. Because technology is growing at such\na fast pace, it has been diﬃcult\
    \ for policymakers to keep up\nwith the industry. Tere is great uncertainty regarding\n\
    matters like reimbursement policies, privacy protection, and\nhealthcare laws.\
    \ In addition, telemedicine laws vary from\nstate to state.\nTere are currently\
    \ 29 states with telemedicine parity\nlaws, which require private payers to reimburse\
    \ telemedicine\nservices in the same way they would reimburse in-person\nvisits.\
    \ As additional states adopt parity laws, private payers\nmay institute more guidelines\
    \ and restrictions for tele-\nmedicine services. Although it is a step in the\
    \ right direction,\nthere is still uncertainty regarding reimbursement rates,\n\
    billing procedures, and more.\n1.2. Fewer Face-to-Face Consultations. Several\
    \ physicians\nand patients are ﬁnding it diﬃcult to adapt to telemedicine,\nespecially\
    \ older adults. Physicians are very concerned about\npatient mismanagement. While\
    \ advances in medicine have\nmade it more eﬃcient to use technology, there are\
    \ times\nwhen system outages occur. Tere is also the potential for\nerror as technology\
    \ cannot always capture what the human\ntouch can.\n1.3. Technology Is Expensive.\
    \ Healthcare systems that adopt\ntelemedicine solutions can attest that they require\
    \ a lot of\ntime and money. Implementing a new system requires\ntraining, and\
    \ sometimes staﬀ members ﬁnd it diﬃcult to\nwelcome this change. Practice managers,\
    \ nurses, physicians,\nand more have to learn how to utilize the system so that\n\
    practices can see the beneﬁts. Although telemedicine is\nexpensive in the beginning,\
    \ healthcare systems should see a\npositive return on investment over time due\
    \ to more patients\nand less staﬀ.\nTe major components of healthcare systems\
    \ are\nidentiﬁcation, location, sensing, and connectivity as shown\nin Figure\
    \ 1. Smart healthcare is implemented through a wide\nrange of systems: emergency\
    \ services, smart computing,\nsensors, lab on chips, remote monitoring, wearable\
    \ devices,\nconnectivity devices, and big data.\nTe IoT based systems are equipped\
    \ with body sensor\nnetworks within telemedicine systems. Tey include devices\n\
    with special type of nodes that sense periodic diﬀerence of\npatient data; to\
    \ check the ventilation conditions for the\npatients in rooms, sensors are used\
    \ to collect data for dif-\nferent measures contributing to ventilation process\
    \ of a\nroom. Tese sensors are programmed to assess data of\ndiﬀerent ranges for\
    \ temperature, pressure, humidity, and\nother signiﬁcant environmental variables.\n\
    Tese arrangements help to monitor the patient con-\nditions remotely. Te system\
    \ can send periodic reports to the\nhospital and maintain the patient history.\
    \ Te hospital staﬀ\ncan view the data and prepare the treatment plan for the\n\
    patient under observation. Te second type of devices used\nin IoT healthcare systems\
    \ is based on wireless sensor net-\nworks. Te situation is more complex than the\
    \ above sce-\nnario in terms of remote area patient monitoring and\nmanagement\
    \ task. In some situations, IoT is the most re-\nliable and cheapest solution,\
    \ and the relationship between\ndiﬀerent devices and interactive communication\
    \ systems\nalso needs to be investigated with more formal objectives.\nTechnology\
    \ makes it easier to monitor the patient\nhealth by sending information to healthcare\
    \ teams such as a\ndoctor, nurses, and specialists through IoT (Internet of\n\
    things) and mobile technologies. It would be helpful for\nprofessionals to save\
    \ and gather patient data using store-\nand-forward method so that it is accessible\
    \ at any time. Te\nrole and services of IoT in modern healthcare are depicted\n\
    in Figure 2.\nInternet of things (IoT) has diﬀerent methodologies:\nsmart healthcare,\
    \ traﬃc control, smart dustbin, and vehicle\nparking. Te health of patient is\
    \ monitored by screen, so it is\ndiﬃcult to examine the patient all the time.\
    \ Terefore, here,\npatient’s current status, i.e., pulse rate, temperature, position\n\
    of body, blood glucose, and ECG, can be measured inten-\nsively by using sensors.\
    \ Te sensors are attached to Arduino\nUNO sensors that, when attached to the body\
    \ Arduino\nboard, get information and transmit it to the server. From\nthis server,\
    \ the information is forwarded to the doctor who\nadvises for medicine.\nSmart\
    \ healthcare system is actually a technology in\nwhich treatments of patients\
    \ are possible and can improve\nthe standard of life [7]. In the concept of smart\
    \ health, the\ne-health concept is also included which has commands on\nmany technologies\
    \ like electronic record management,\nsmart home services, and intelligent and\
    \ medical connected\ndevices. Sensors, smart devices, and expert systems support\n\
    the health practice for smart healthcare system.\nHealthcare facilities in modern\
    \ age are key challenge\nespecially in developing countries where remote areas\
    \ face\nlack of high-quality hospitals and medical experts. As ar-\ntiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ has revolutionized various ﬁelds of life,\nhealth has also beneﬁted from it.\
    \ Te existing architecture of\n2\nScientiﬁc Programming\nstore-and-forward method\
    \ of conventional telemedicine is\nfacing some problems:\n(i) Need for a local\
    \ health center with dedicated staﬀ.\n(ii) Need for medical equipment to prepare\
    \ patient\nreports.\n(iii) Time constraint of 24–48 hours in receiving diag-\n\
    nosis and medication details from a medical expert\nin a main hospital.\n(iv)\
    \ Cost of local health centers.\n(v) Need for Wi-Fi connection.\nIn this paper,\
    \ a novel and intelligent healthcare system is\nproposed; it is based on modern\
    \ technologies like Internet of\nthings (IoT) and machine learning. Tis system\
    \ is intelligent\nenough to sense and process a patient’s data through a\nmedical\
    \ decision support system. Tis system is low-cost\nsolution for the people of\
    \ remote areas; they can use it to ﬁnd\nout whether they are suﬀering from a serious\
    \ health issue\nand cure it accordingly by contacting near hospitals.\n2. Related\
    \ Work\nTe IoTterm was initially coined in 1999 and got attention of\ncommunity\
    \ as one of the advanced technologies as it is a\ncombination of sensors [8],\
    \ imbedded electronics, and\nsoftware components for decision support systems\
    \ [9]. Te\nIoTalso supports smart systems with the help of lightweight\nnetworking\
    \ connections and sensors data [10]. Te IoT\ncovers almost all domains such as\
    \ home based smart systems\nlike security, entertainment, and health; transport\
    \ systems\nlike smart parking, traﬃc, logistics emergency services, and\nhighway\
    \ management; community based systems like smart\nmetering, business intelligence,\
    \ surveillance, environment,\nand retail systems [10].\nHealthcare is one of the\
    \ primary concerns that need to be\nimproved by IoT and related technologies [11].\
    \ IoT based\nhealthcare consists of three stages of automation, namely,\ndata\
    \ collection by sensors, analytics based on the collected\ndata, and decision\
    \ making based on the collected data [12].\nHealthcare systems have a lot of potential\
    \ to be improved by\nIoT based systems. Tere are many diﬀerent types of\nhealthcare\
    \ applications proposed by the researchers like\ne-health [13], community health\
    \ [14], home health moni-\ntoring [15], telemedicine [16], and clinical support\
    \ for\ndoctors [17]. Te primary contribution of this research is to\nprovide devices\
    \ that help in monitoring, management, and\ncommunication between diﬀerent stakeholders\
    \ in the\nhealthcare domain.\nTable 1 shows the comparison of our work with related\n\
    work. It shows that IoT based models provide much as-\nsistance to patients, but\
    \ the time constraints can be reduced\nwith the help of CDSS in the absence of\
    \ medical staﬀ.\nTe methodology of IoTfor smart home, vehicle parking,\nand traﬃc\
    \ control is diﬀerent as compared to the health\nmonitoring and management systems.\
    \ Te one obvious\nbeneﬁt is to monitor the patients 24/7 [26], which is almost\n\
    impossible with manpower. Te second goal achieved by IoT\nbased solution is to\
    \ monitor primary measures needs to\ndetermine the patient conditions, and treatment\
    \ plan may\ninclude pulse rate, body temperature, respiratory rate, body\nposition,\
    \ blood pressure, ECG, and glucose level. Tese\nsensor networks are connected\
    \ through Arduino board to\ncollect the information through attached sensors.\
    \ Te col-\nlected information can be transmitted to the server and\nfurther reﬁned\
    \ for decision making or decision support\nsystems.\nInvestigational experiments\
    \ are made with the assistance\nof sensors, and the patient’s health is traced\
    \ with Internet.\nWhat remains is the keen observation of pulse rate, eco of\n\
    heart, pressure level, temperature, etc. If there is any dis-\nturbance or change\
    \ in pulse rate or temperature, the system\nalerts the person taking care of the\
    \ patient. Trough the\nInternet, the system shows the pulse rate and temperature\
    \ of\nthe patient.\nTe IoT with mobile technology provides smart and\neasier ways\
    \ to look after the patients under observation, their\nbody movements, and health\
    \ conditions and provides in-\ntelligent mechanisms to handle and share the relevant\
    \ in-\nformation with relevant stakeholders. Te study [11]\ndesigned a system\
    \ which collects patient data and sends it to\ncloud for further utilization by\
    \ people investigating health\ndomain. Te multipurpose application may also provide\
    \ the\nfamilies of patients with regular updates regarding patient\nSensors\n\

    \ al. [26] demonstrated a system to auto-\nmatically gather data from patients\
    \ and store the gathered\ndata into cloud for permanent use to help health profes-\n\
    sionals. Te system also helps the guardians of the patients to\nknow the health\
    \ information.\nTe study [27] proposes a system to track the patient\nrecords\
    \ with the measures of pulse rate, ECO, blood pres-\nsure, and body temperature\
    \ and maintain the patient his-\ntory. If the system detects any abnormal behavior\
    \ in the\nmeasures observed, it immediately alerts the emergency\nteam to handle\
    \ the situation. Te article [28] provides a\nsurvey on the smart healthcare. It\
    \ discusses in detail the\nimportance, application, requirements, and classiﬁcation\
    \ of\nhealthcare along with the challenges, vulnerability, and se-\ncurity attacks.\
    \ Healthcare system plays a vital role in in-\ncreasing application by using connectivity\
    \ technologies. Te\nbody sensor as a medical device is used to implement smart\n\
    healthcare as shown in Figure 3. Smart telemedicine systems\n[15] are designed\
    \ to monitor and manage the patient records\nby using sensors and microcontrollers.\
    \ Te system observes\nthe body conditions and transmits the data to cloud servers.\n\
    Te patient condition is observed and stored on servers for\nfurther use and decision\
    \ making.\nTe study [29] investigates the challenges and conse-\nquences of remote\
    \ health systems. Te system comprises\nwireless transmission system which collects\
    \ ECG, body\ntemperature, and pulse rate of the patients in remote lo-\ncations\
    \ for severe problems like cardiogenic shock. Te\npatient is monitored, and data\
    \ is sent to the doctor to analyze\nthem and prepare the treatment plan. Tis data\
    \ also helps the\nsupporting staﬀ to take the necessary actions [30].\nTe study\
    \ [31] states that health monitoring system is\nessential for a good health because\
    \ health problems are\nincreasing day by day like cardiac failure, lungs failure,\
    \ and\nheart related diseases. Nowadays, IoT became a platform for\nmany services\
    \ and applications in which sensor nodes are\nused. Te monitoring of patients\
    \ that is continuously done\nby doctors is the base of revealed consequences of\
    \ generic\nhealth monitoring system.\nTe data analytics with big data enhanced\
    \ the capacities\nof healthcare management system. Te IoT healthcare is\nbased\
    \ on sensors, data collection devices, cloud services or\nconnectivity provider\
    \ devices, and mobile applications. Te\nmain concern of the physician is to separate\
    \ the information\nof one patient from all other massive information of patients\n\
    in the healthcare system. From such huge information, the\nphysician makes critical\
    \ decision about the patient health\nand suggests the treatment. He et al. concluded\
    \ that altering\npatient information in real time is very important [32].\nIn\
    \ order to build a smart system or application, the\nphysical objects are connected\
    \ by using IoT (Internet of\nthings). Te study used IoT for smart resource management\n\
    system (SRMS) and intelligent chair system (ICS). An\nArduino board is attached\
    \ to the sensors, user ID is con-\nnected through RFID reader with the chairs,\
    \ and chair al-\nlotment is managed and monitored by this system.\nTe study [33]\
    \ investigates the inﬂuence of medical\nsystem with remote patients. Te patient\
    \ monitoring is the\nmain purpose of the system with a prototype application.\n\
    Te main service provided by this prototyping system is the\nmonitoring of vital\
    \ signs of patient health in ICU. Te\nsystem is more eﬀective for patients undergoing\
    \ surgical\nprocedures or other treatments that need intensive care and\nmonitoring.\
    \ Te major beneﬁts claimed by the authors of the\nstudy are low power proﬁle sensor,\
    \ wireless communication,\nand gateway for cheap communication. Te system is also\n\
    available on web domain for the patient caretakers to ob-\nserve and be informed\
    \ about the patient status.\nA smart health monitoring system [34] is designed\
    \ and\nimplemented for ambulance coupled with communication\nchannels. Te IoT\
    \ was used with this smart healthcare\nsystem with the capability of low power\
    \ sensors. Te human\nbody sensors are considered an eﬃcient mode of commu-\nnication\
    \ for near ﬁeld body sensor network application.\nTe study [35] presents a generic\
    \ model for IoT based\nhealthcare system. Te model identiﬁes key components\n\
    with an end-to-end IoT healthcare system. Te authors\nclaim that there was no\
    \ end-to-end IoT based remote patient\nmonitoring system. Te system consists of\
    \ ﬁve sensors, three\nof which were for monitoring patient conditions like pulse\n\
    rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Te other two\nsensors were used\
    \ to monitor blood pressure and blood\noxygen. Te paper also identiﬁes technological\
    \ challenges\nand potential opportunities for remote healthcare moni-\ntoring\
    \ and management system with IoT.\nTe study [36] presents the applications and\
    \ potential\nusage of IoT in healthcare systems. Te major task per-\nformed by\
    \ this experimental study was to monitor the pa-\ntient conditions and make it\

    the patient body movements.\nWearable body devices [37] were used to design systems\n\
    for monitoring and management of patients health. Te\nstudy used body wearable\

    \ study was to\nobserve the patient health during surgical procedures,\nconsidering\
    \ more useful and reliable data collection during\nsuch complex situations where\
    \ human observational skills\nare not enough. Te second major beneﬁt was the reduction\n\
    of equipment size for patient monitoring and wireless en-\nvironment for patient\
    \ care. Devices like Fitbit health\nmonitor, Pebble smart watch, and Google glass\
    \ are con-\nsidered as modern devices for health monitoring and body\ncare solutions.\
    \ Te important wearable devices are mea-\nsuring the blood pressure which is used\

    \ Te algorithm\nused in the system will handle the usage of the sensors and\n\
    control their cost and lifetime. Te proposed system ad-\ndresses the issue of\
    \ remote monitoring of patients and\nprovides them with necessary treatment through\
    \ experts in\nthe hospital.\nTe smart healthcare monitoring and patient manage-\n\
    ment system proposed in this study consists of communi-\ncation channels, embedded\
    \ internal and external sensors,\nIoTserver, and cloud storage and is supported\
    \ by a gateway.\nTese activities are performed at diﬀerent levels of reﬁne-\n\
    ment named application layer, management layer, network\nlayer, and device layer.\
    \ Te architecture of the proposed\nsystem is presented in Figure 4.\nTe architecture\
    \ shown in Figure 4 is revised to show\nmore details. Te use of sensors and decision\
    \ support system\nin telemedicine is a novel idea that improves working\nperformance\
    \ of telemedicine in rural areas.\n3.1. Data Collection through Sensors for Smart\
    \ Healthcare\nSystem. With the help of IoT (Internet of things), the\nproposed\
    \ system will be designed to implement a device in\nremote clinic. Te device will\
    \ take data of patient’s heart-\nbeats, body temperature, and blood pressure as\
    \ input and\nwill send it to the doctor concerned in the hospital. With the\n\
    help of the data, the doctor will analyze the condition of the\npatient and will\
    \ inform the remote area clinic crew about the\nnecessary steps for patient’s\
    \ best treatment.\nTe architecture presented in Figure 5 shows physical\nview\
    \ with necessary components of the proposed system.\nTe system consists of three\
    \ sensors: body temperature\nsensor, pulse rate sensor, and heartbeat sensors.\
    \ Tese three\nsensors are connected through Arduino board to collect and\nclassify\
    \ the patient data. Te data transmission is managed\nby communication and networking\

    \ Fuzzy Logic-Based Smart Healthcare Monitoring and\nManagement. Tere are the\
    \ following problems: a single\nmodel is not enough, so two or more models are\
    \ combined\nto solve that problem [38]. When diﬀerent models are\ncombined, they\
    \ provide an eﬀective solution to the problem,\nreferred to as a hybrid system.\
    \ A hybrid system is used to\nobtain indoor air quality using the fuzzy logic\
    \ system and\nneural networks represented as the fuzzy neural network\n(FNN).\n\
    Neural networks focus on perceiving patterns, not on the\nlogic of how the decision\
    \ is made [39]. Te fuzzy logic\nsystems are good at explaining how the decision\
    \ is made, but\nthe inference rules are diﬃcult task as prior knowledge is\nrequired\
    \ [40]. Tese limitations lead to the fuzzy neural\nnetwork. Rules of fuzzy systems\
    \ are acquired from the neural\nnetworks patterns [41].\nTis process begins with\
    \ a “fuzzy neuron,” and the\nprocess of the fuzzy neuron is divided into two steps\
    \ as\nfollows [42]:\n(i) Evolution of a fuzzy neuron model.\n(ii) Development\
    \ of the model and its algorithm that\nconsolidate fuzziness into the neural system.\n\
    Figure 6 indicates that neural inputs are provided for\nneural network that provides\
    \ neural outputs. Neural outputs\nare the inference rules for the fuzzy interface\
    \ that are stored\nin the system as a database and used for decision making and\n\
    provide learning algorithms for the neural network as prior\nknowledge. Data of\
    \ neural networks is gathered by propa-\ngation algorithm, so the procedure is\
    \ slow. Including speciﬁc\ndata into the neural network to clarify learning techniques\
    \ is\na diﬃcult task. Fuzzy rules are explained, and they provide\nbetter performance,\
    \ so fuzzy systems are used in restricted\nsystems and knowledge acquisition is\
    \ a diﬃcult task. To\nsolve these problems in solution design, the fuzzy rules\
    \ are\ndesigned from numerical data.\nTe neural network model named Approximate\
    \ Rea-\nsoning Intelligent Control (ARIC) (see Figure 7) uses fuzzy\nneuron system.\
    \ Tis fuzzy neuron system is trained by\nphysical system forecast. It applies\
    \ a ﬁne-tuning refreshing\ndata method to control the information base.\n1\n2\n\

    \ combination of fuzzy system with neural\nnetworks which boost the advantages\
    \ of both decision-\nmaking methods. Te framework can learn, and information\n\
    utilized in the framework has the type of if-then fuzzy\nsystem. Te rules are\
    \ deﬁned in advance, and the system can\nstart without outside help, so it adapts\
    \ quicker than a\nstandard neural system. Te framework named ARIC\nconsists of\
    \ AEN action position which is used to evaluate the\nnetwork constructed through\
    \ information base. Te ARIC\nalso contains ASN operation used for network selection.\
    \ It is\na multilayer neural network technique with fuzzy control\nsystem. Te\
    \ ASN component has two separate fuzzy in-\nterfaces in the ﬁrst layer of the\
    \ proposed system. Te neural\nnetwork is placed in the second layer. Te neural\
    \ system\nﬁnds f [a, a + 1] operation, a part of conﬁdence acquired\nthrough fuzzy\
    \ inference. It should gain p (a + 1) using the\namount of time denoted by t and\
    \ the condition of framework\nt + 1. A modiﬁcation module which is stochastic\
    \ in nature\nimproves the control with p(t) of ﬂuﬀy part and the expected\nlikelihood\
    \ regrading decisions and produces the ﬁnal output.\nu′(t) \x88 r( u(t), d[t,\
    \ t + 1].\n(1)\nTe unit ci of fuzzy inference is organized to assess the\nfuzzy\
    \ guideline. Te unit for information aj is a standard\nancestor and acquires a\
    \ unit u. Te unit u communicates\nwith the activity control. It is called defuzziﬁed\
    \ mixture\nwhich ﬁnishes the process. Te information layer in this\nframework\
    \ is fuzziﬁed; it is monotonic in nature and has the\ncapacities to utilize its\
    \ components in ARIC model. Te\nfuzzy tag is used in rules to balance local standards.\
    \ Te\nancestor’s enrolment is estimated by these standards and\nthen duplicated\
    \ and uses load joining with the association of\ninformation component. Te qualities\
    \ base of this system\nproduces the ﬁnal input. Each unit which was obscured is\n\
    exceptional monotonic work communicating with ﬁnal\nstandard. Te monotonicity\
    \ of this function yields the\noutput. Te process is eﬀortlessly determined by\
    \ the op-\nposite capacity. Tis esteem is produced with the function of\nheaviness\
    \ and with the association of hidden unit. Te yield\nvalue is ﬁnally determined\
    \ by weighted average method.\nTe action operators used to evaluate the network,\
    \ which\ntries to forecast the model activity. Te neural netowrk\nmethod used\
    \ in this system is a typical feedforward neural\nnetwork system. Tis feedforward\
    \ neural network system is\nbased on shrouded layer which collects the model states\
    \ as\ninformation. It uses the blunder ﬂag r from the physical\nmodel as a piece\
    \ of helping data. Te process gets v[t, t] of\nthe proposed system produced as\
    \ a forecast for future. Tis\nsystem relies on load of time t and the model constraints.\
    \ Te\nt is either t or t + 1. Te conditions in this system are\nportrayed by fortiﬁcation\
    \ of higher values for information\ncollected for decision making. Te change in\
    \ load is man-\naged by support method that uses the output of the system\nstates\
    \ of the network and action state evaluation method.\nTe engineering of ARIC was\
    \ connected to postadjustment.\nIt is also demonstrated that the model with the\
    \ compre-\nhension and its assignments.\nTe signs and weights are real numbers\
    \ with input neurons.\nTe information does not change these signs. Te yield is\
    \ very\nmuch equivalent to the information. Te signal ai may col-\nlaborate with\

    \ sources.\nTe six i/o pins are PWM output. Te microprocessor has\n16 MHz with\
    \ a power jack, USB connection. Te other\ncomponents on this microcontroller chip\
    \ are analog input\nand reset button with ICSP header. Te power is supplied by\n\
    a USB interface, and Arduino is designed as open electronic\nplatform. Te basic\
    \ settings on Arduino board are input/\noutput, set/reset button, sensor lights,\
    \ and activating motor\nwith output LED.\nHC-05 Bluetooth module: To add wireless\

    Temperature sensor (see Figure 10) is used to detect heat\nstroke, body temperature,\
    \ and fever. In wearable healthcare\nsystem, body temperature is used as a diagnostic\
    \ tool. For the\nmeasurement of body temperature, thermistor type sensors\nare\
    \ used. Temperature sensing accuracy is limited.\nTe temperature sensor (see Figure\
    \ 11) is integrated\ncircuit which is used to measure the body temperature in\n\
    centigrade. Te temperature is shown as voltage output. Te\nmodel number of this\
    \ sensor is LM35. Tis model of body\ntemperature sensor is considered better in\
    \ performance than\nlinear temperature sensor. Te reason is that user need not\n\
    convert Kelvin scale to centigrade scale by using this model.\nTe sensor under\
    \ this setup is very useful for remote sensing\nand calibrates Celsius scale.\n\
    Te emergency conditions are measured through cardiac\narrest, pulmonary embolism,\
    \ vasovagal syncope, and pulse\nsensor. Te pulse rate is primary measure for critical\
    \ medical\nconditions and body ﬁtness conditions. Te pulse rate sensor\nis the\

    \ Experimental Results\n4.1. Experiment Setup. Te system is tested under the su-\n\
    pervision of medical staﬀ. Samples are collected from dif-\nferent areas of South\
    \ Punjab using the proposed device. Te\ndata collected through sensors was forwarded\
    \ to the server.\nTe results are presented at the Arduino application and web\n\
    browser. Table 3 shows the information about locations that\nwe selected to test\
    \ the proposed model. Almost eight dif-\nferent locations are selected for testing.\
    \ Te distance from\nBVH and testing period of selected locations are diﬀerent.\n\
    4.2. Dataset. Table 4 shows the report sample of the patient\nthat is generated\
    \ on the server after receiving data collected\nthrough sensors and forwarded\
    \ through smart device. Te\nreport has three sections: patient’s data, sensor\
    \ data, and\nsymptoms of the patient.\nTable 5 shows the comparison of response\
    \ time of the\nqueries that are responded to by CDSS and by physician.\nAlmost\
    \ 270 queries were received on the server from se-\nlective areas. Most of the\
    \ queries were treated by CDSS.\nTable 5 clearly shows that average response time\
    \ of the\nqueries that are responded to by CDSS is quite short as\ncompared to\
    \ the response time of the queries responded to\nby physician. Te proposed system\
    \ is low-cost and eﬃcient\nsolution for the people of remote areas; they can use\
    \ it to ﬁnd\nout whether they are suﬀering from a serious health issue\nand cure\
    \ it accordingly by contacting near hospitals.\nUsing sensors and decision support\
    \ system in tele-\nmedicine is a new idea, and Table 5 shows how it minimizes\n\
    time constraint in comparison to the classical telemedicine\nmethod.\n4.3. Used\
    \ Tools and Data Analysis. Te use of analytics\npotentially improves the accuracy\
    \ and permits early disease\ndetection, personalization, and cost reduction in\
    \ medical\nfacilities. Te following set of tools and libraries were used to\n\
    process and interpret patient’s symptoms and health data.\n(i) Fuzzy neural networks\

    \ and Discussion\nTe smart healthcare patient monitoring and management\nsystem\
    \ is designed as intelligent system. Te proposed system\nbeneﬁted from fuzzy logic\
    \ system which is easy to use and\nimplement for decision making. Te organization\
    \ of the pro-\nposed system is quite new by using sensors data and fuzzy based\n\
    decision making. Te implementation details are already pre-\nsented in a previous\
    \ section with the hardware used for this\nproposed system. Te data collected\
    \ through sensors was for-\nwarded to the server. Te results are presented at\
    \ the Arduino\napplication and web browser. Te user may perform some\nactions\
    \ against the information presented by the system. Te\nthree types of sensor data\
    \ received from the sensors are further\nprocessed into output by fuzzy logic\
    \ system. Te classiﬁcation is\nshown in Table 6; there were four classes of temperature\n\
    measure (no fever, fever, high fever, very high fever) detected by\ndiﬀerent temperature\
    \ ranges from 100°F to 105°F.\nTable 7 represents the three classes of pulse rate\
    \ for a\nnormal human being which are low, normal, and high. Te\npulse rate less\
    \ than 60 per minute is considered as low pulse\nrate. Te pulse rate between 60\
    \ and 100 is considered as\nnormal pulse rate. Te pulse rate greater than 100\
    \ is con-\nsidered as high pulse rate.\nTable 8 represents the normal to abnormal\
    \ range for\nblood pressure. Te blood pressure 120/80 BP is considered\nas normal\
    \ blood pressure. Te blood pressure 129–140/\n81–89 BP is considered as high blood\
    \ pressure. Te blood\npressure greater than 141/91 BP is considered as very high\n\
    blood pressure.\nTable 9 represents the data collected through sensors at\ndiﬀerent\
    \ intervals of a patient. Te data ranges are also\ncalibrated by Tables 6–8\n\
    Figure 13 represents the variation in data collected\nthrough temperature sensor,\
    \ pulse rate sensor, and blood\npressure sensor. Te data ranges are also calibrated\
    \ from\nTables 6–9.\nTe input data is collected and calibrated; in the second\n\
    step, fuzzy logic is applied for the decision making for the\ndetermination of\
    \ patient condition. Table 10 represents the\ncalibrated output values for the\
    \ inputted data.\nTe fuzzy logic system takes the decision, and accuracy\nof the\
    \ decision is measured (Figure 14). It is shown in\nTable 10 that accuracy of\
    \ the system is from 94% to 100% for\nthe proposed system. It shows that the proposed\
    \ system is\nworking as per the rules deﬁned for the decision making of\npatient\
    \ care and management system. Te accuracy of the\nproposed system is measured\
    \ by the formulae in\nAccuracy \x88 \U0010FF58 μ(ai)\nn .\n(5)\nTe accuracy of\
    \ the proposed system is calculated by (5).\nIn (5), μ(ai) is the accuracy in\
    \ the percentage for the data in\nexperiment, and n is the number of experiments.\
    \ Te av-\nerage accuracy achieved in this dataset is 97%.\nTe experimental results\
    \ show that intelligent and smart\ndecision making makes the sensor based IoT\
    \ system con-\nvenient and feasible. Te methodology used with IoT im-\nproves\
    \ the performance and throughput of the system. Te\npercent error of the results\
    \ is calculated by using the formula\nshown in (6). Here, the accepted value is\
    \ required accuracy,\nand experimental accuracy is achieved accuracy of the\n\
    experiments.\npercent_error \x88 accepted_value − experiemtnal_value\ntotal_value\n\

    \ of the achieved results.\nSection 2 discussed many systems consisting of sensors\n\
    with IoT. Te proposed system is the ﬁrst patient care\nmonitoring and management\
    \ system which uses fuzzy logic\nsystem to determine the patient conditions and\
    \ decide the\npossible treatments. Te results in Tables 9 and 10 show that\nour\
    \ approach performs better with the help of sensors and\ndecision support systems.\
    \ Te fuzzy logic system decision\nmaking enhances the usefulness and the accuracy\
    \ of the\nproposed system. Tis system is novel in terms of using\nintelligent\
    \ decision making with sensor and IoT based\nsystem. Te results show that the\
    \ proposed approach is more\naccurate, time saving, cheap, and easy to use. Te\
    \ proposed\nsystem has the following contributions. Tis is the ﬁrst\napproach\
    \ that presents a smart irrigation system for tunnel\nfarming.\nTable 5: Comparison\

    \ method consists of sensors for body tem-\nperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure\
    \ to assess the con-\ndition of the patient under observation. For determining\
    \ the\npossible conditions and cure, the system used a knowledge\nbase and fuzzy\
    \ logic system for intelligent decision making\nfor patient care, monitoring,\
    \ and management. Te pro-\nposed method also tries to improve the eﬀectiveness\
    \ of the\nsystem for patient care and monitoring in terms of time,\ncost, and\
    \ manpower utilization. Te proposed approach\naddresses the patient monitoring\
    \ with sensors and shows\nreasonable accuracy and cost savings with respect to\
    \ the\nsystems in use. Te study was tested on a small sample of the\npopulation\
    \ and found to be eﬀective, accurate, and eﬃcient\nfor the purpose. Te proposed\
    \ approach is generalized so far,\nand it is possible to customize it for more\
    \ critical conditions\nlike operation theatre, intensive care unit patients, newborn\n\
    babies, and more complex patients. Tere are three con-\ntributions of this work,\
    \ summarized in Section 5:\n(1) Te novel idea of using sensors with conventional\n\
    telemedicine\n(2) Te new and improved way of diagnosis using fuzzy\nneural networks\
    \ based approach\n(3) Te use of decision support system to minimize time\nconstraint\n\
    of\nconventional\nstore-and-forward\nmethod of telemedicine in rural areas\nTe\
    \ results also show that fuzzy logic system is good choice\nfor intelligent decision-making\
    \ systems and it also provides a\nlightweight solution in terms of its devices\
    \ and software\ncomponents. In the future, we propose the use of more sensors\n\
    to get more patient data for better and improved diagnosis.\nData Availability\n\

    is based on the idea of space network coding, which is a technique that uses additional
    relay nodes to improve the network performance, rather than transmitting additional
    coded data, and is able to achieve the optimal trade-off between the number of
    relay nodes and the network performance.

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have taken a giant leap in scale, expanding\
    \ their applica-\nbility to a large variety of technological domains and applications,\
    \ ranging from the Internet of things\n(IoT) for smart cities and smart homes\
    \ to wearable technology healthcare applications, underwater,\nagricultural and\
    \ environmental monitoring and many more. This expansion is rapidly growing every\n\
    passing day in terms of the variety, heterogeneity and the number of devices which\
    \ such applications\nsupport. Data collection is commonly the core application\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks, which are\ntypically composed of a large variety of\
    \ devices, some constrained by their resources (e.g., processing,\nstorage, energy)\
    \ and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges span all the conceptual\n\
    communication layers, from the Physical to the Applicational. Many novel solutions\
    \ devised in the\npast do not scale well with the exponential growth in the population\
    \ of the devices and need to\nbe adapted, revised, or new innovative solutions\
    \ are required to comply with this massive growth.\nFurthermore, recent technological\
    \ advances present new opportunities which can be leveraged in\nthis context.\
    \ This paper provides a cross-layer perspective and review of data gathering in\
    \ WSN and\nIoT networks. We provide some background and essential milestones that\
    \ have laid the foundation\nof many subsequent solutions suggested over the years.\
    \ We mainly concentrate on recent state-of-\nthe-art research, which facilitates\
    \ the scalable, energy-efﬁcient, cost-effective, and human-friendly\nfunctionality\
    \ of WSNs and the novel applications in the years to come.\nKeywords: wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs); Internet of things (IoT); data gathering; wearables;\n\
    compressed sensing; network coding; mobile sink; energy harvesting\n1. Introduction\n\
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are data measurement and gathering networks\nbased\
    \ on small hardware (HW) units capable of sensing, monitoring, or measuring their\n\
    surroundings. The sensed data are transmitted directly or by relay via other sensors\
    \ to\nsome sink or server or a base station. The ultimate objective of such a\
    \ conﬁguration is to\nprovide control or exploration capabilities over an area\
    \ where the network is deployed.\nWSN characteristics can vary substantially:\
    \ they can be composed of a few to hundreds of\nthousands of sensors; the monitored\
    \ terrain can range from a small coverage area (e.g., the\nhuman body) to a vast\
    \ realm (e.g., a forest area for ﬁre detection); the sensed variables of\ninterest\
    \ of the surroundings are diverse (e.g., weather or health parameters, acceleration,\n\
    pollution); and the sensors can have different characteristics (e.g., size, computational\n\
    power, energy source).\nThe Internet of things (IoT) aims to improve day-to-day\
    \ life. The concept includes\nsmart cities, smart homes, pervasive health care,\
    \ assisted living, environmental monitoring,\nsurveillance, and so on. The IoT\
    \ paradigm relies on interconnecting a large number of\ndevices (things) linked\
    \ by the Internet via heterogeneous access networks through which\nthey can exchange\
    \ information with one or more Internet gateways that can process the\ndata, take\
    \ action, and forward them to another destination if needed. Since many IoT\n\
    devices are expected to be wireless, and since sensing is one of the main tasks\
    \ and tools\nutilized by the IoT paradigm, IoT systems will rely extensively on\
    \ WSN technology. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22072650\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n2 of 44\nscale of\
    \ scenarios where WSN are deployed nowadays is vast. Traditionally, WSN were\n\
    classiﬁed based on their placement (e.g., terrestrial, underground, multimedia)\
    \ [1]. Since\nWSNs are closely associated with IoT, contemporary classiﬁcation\
    \ tends to re-attribute the\nnotions of the WSN domain to the IoT domain [2] and\
    \ classify them based on their primary\nobjectives, such as smart cities [3,4],\
    \ healthcare [5], retail and leisure [6], utilities (e.g., smart\nhome energy\
    \ control, water metering and leak detection, and other general infrastructure\n\
    monitoring networks) [7], agriculture and environmental safety (e.g., smart farming\
    \ and\nharvesting, pest control [8–10], seismology monitoring [11,12], oceanology\
    \ [13]), and more.\nAs previously explained, one of the main tasks of both WSN\
    \ and IoT systems is\ndata collection and dissemination. Reports are collected\
    \ from the devices, and updates\nand operational assignments are distributed.\
    \ Maintenance and functional assessments\nare also collected and disseminated.\
    \ Data collection and dissemination in very dense\nnetworks such as WSNs and IoT\
    \ networks which span heterogeneous devices, a signiﬁcant\npercentage of which\
    \ are expected to be small, with very constrained processing, storage,\nand energy\
    \ resources and with minimal network capabilities, is challenging and draws\n\
    signiﬁcant attention both by the industrial and academic communities. Some of\
    \ these\nchallenges include: (i) Information management — the amount of information\
    \ collected or\nneeding to be disseminated to the relevant entities is enormous,\
    \ and some is expected to be\nredundant, both in terms of the information sent\
    \ by each device, which can be compressed,\nand in terms of same information received\
    \ by different entities. Accordingly, innovative\ntechniques are required for\
    \ data compression to reduce transmitted data over wireless\nchannels and aggregation\
    \ techniques that exploit the redundancy between information sent\nby the different\
    \ entities. (ii) Data analysis and reaction — the expected vast data exchange\n\
    and the low latency requirement (at least for some of the information collected)\
    \ require\nprocessing and analysis of data in real-time or near real-time, to\
    \ enable timely decision\nmaking and instantaneous action-taking.\nThe ability\
    \ to successfully transmit and gather vast streams of data incoming from an\n\
    enormous number of devices and sensors and ﬁnally to successfully analyze them,\
    \ in order\nto automatically control a much larger scope of everyday life systems,\
    \ directly couples\nthe process of data gathering with Big Data related challenges\
    \ (e.g., [14–17]). Furthermore,\nleveraging Cloud Computing platforms offers signiﬁcant\
    \ advances in data analytical abil-\nities (e.g., [18–20]). It provides new horizons\
    \ to further develop and increase the size of\nWSN/IoT networks both in the sense\
    \ of the number of sensing units and in the sense of\nthe amount of the acquired\
    \ data (e.g., [21–23]). (iii) Connectivity — collecting and dissem-\ninating data\
    \ from and to many devices, potentially through vast, dense, heterogeneous\nnetworks,\
    \ will be one of the biggest challenges of the future of IoT; accordingly, novel\n\
    MAC protocols and coding schemes should be devised to comply with this challenge.\
    \ With\nthis respect, air time utilization and energy efﬁciency are of primary\
    \ importance for the\nMAC layer protocol design. Any MAC layer protocol should\
    \ ensure that devices utilize the\nwireless channel frugally and with minimum\
    \ energy consumption. (iv) Security and Pri-\nvacy — Connecting enormous numbers\
    \ of devices to the Internet exposes the IoT network\nto serious security vulnerabilities.\
    \ All the more so since the relevant entities are limited.\nAccordingly, issues\
    \ such as authenticity, data encryption, and vulnerability to attacks (e.g.,\n\
    device impersonation) are critical for the IoT paradigm’s continuous growth (e.g.,\
    \ [24]).\nIn addition, since the information transmitted over the WSN and IoT\
    \ networks can be\nhighly conﬁdential (e.g., health reports, device tracking),\
    \ the collection and dissemination\nof this information create signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ related to data protection and privacy.\nThis survey will explore the state-of-the-art\
    \ of data collection and dissemination as-\npects in WSNs and IoT environments\
    \ mentioned above. We will review essential milestones\nyet mainly focus on recent\
    \ publications and present the new trends and research directions.\nOur resources\
    \ included mainly Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and our university’s library\ndatabases,\
    \ utilizing the keywords of this paper. We also used important references from\n\
    the bilbiography of the initial papers and ones that cited them. Data collection\
    \ spans all the\nnetworking layers, from the physical implementation of transmitting\
    \ bits across a commu-\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n3 of 44\nnication medium to the\
    \ application layer. Due to the wide-ranging scope of the topic, we\nwill not\
    \ be able to cover all its aspects (for example, in this paper, we will not discuss\
    \ the\ncritical topic of security and privacy). Some of the issues will be covered\
    \ more thoroughly\nthan others. However, since some of the topics we discussed\
    \ rely on the general wireless\ncommunication technology and on broad setup protocols\
    \ which are not data-gathering ori-\nented per se, on some of the topics, we will\
    \ provide a more comprehensive background and\ndescribe protocols that are aimed\
    \ at a broader domain than data-gathering. For example,\nmany medium access control\
    \ (MAC) and wireless routing protocols are designed for a\nwide range of topologies,\
    \ trafﬁc patterns, quality of service requirements, etc. Even though\nthey can\
    \ be applied, they are not explicitly designed for data gathering. We will include\n\
    some more general yet essential studies in our survey. To grasp the whole picture\
    \ and to\nbetter understand some data-gathering-related issues, in some cases,\
    \ we will delve into the\npertinent background and stray into some peripheral\
    \ topics. We will cover topics related to\nall layers of the protocol stack. Sometimes\
    \ classiﬁcation based on a stack is not clear-cut, as\nsome of the issues involve\
    \ multiple stacks.\nIn particular, the survey comprises the following topics:\n\
    The device’s platform, which accommodates the sensing unit, can highly impact\
    \ the\nperformance of the application utilizing it and speciﬁcally the data-gathering\
    \ application,\nand vice versa, the application (e.g., data gathering) can impact\
    \ the platform architecture\nwhen designed in application-oriented manner or when\
    \ some of the essential features and\nrequirements are taken into account in the\
    \ platform design process. The same mutual\neffect also applies to the WSN infrastructure\
    \ and the network architecture (e.g., topology,\nsystem organization). We start\
    \ with reviewing studies pertaining to the general device’s\nplatform and infrastructure-related\
    \ novelties (Section 2). We cover new domains which\nwere only recently exposed\
    \ to WSN and IoT networks and introduced new opportunities for\nalgorithm design\
    \ in such networks. Some of these novel technologies have revolutionized\nthe\
    \ way applications can utilize each particular device as well as the shared network\
    \ and\nhave enabled new algorithm opportunities and design challenges across the\
    \ entire protocol\nstack which we describe throughout this survey.\nNext follows\
    \ Section 3 which provides a focused summary of recent advances in\ncompressed\
    \ sensing—a signal processing technique that can take advantage of sparsity\n\
    and redundancy of the data. In the context of data gathering procedures, compressed\n\
    sensing is utilized to reduce report payload at several levels, which include\
    \ reduction of\nthe sensed data size and the transmitted report size, by pruning\
    \ the devices that need to\nsend reports and by compressing the combined relayed\
    \ data before forwarding it toward\nits destination (the sink). We provide a basic\
    \ compressed sensing background and review\nthe state-of-the-art in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\nSection 4 considers the medium access control (MAC)\
    \ sublayer. In wireless communi-\ncation, channel utilization is critical and\
    \ broadly inﬂuences several performance aspects\nsuch as throughput, latency,\
    \ power utilization, delivery ratio, and more. Over the years,\nnumerous algorithms\
    \ and protocols have been suggested for wireless channel access in\ngeneral, and\
    \ WSNs with their speciﬁc characterization in particular. In Section 4, we review\n\
    only a small fraction of the countless MAC protocols that have been designed for\
    \ WSNs.\nWe mainly concentrate on protocols that highlight a conceptual approach\
    \ or trend and\nreview some of the more recent MAC protocols in data gathering\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks,\nwhich address new challenges such as highly dense\
    \ networks, congested channels, and\nvery limited resources.\nWe ascend the protocol\
    \ stack and in Section 5 we address routing aspects. As with the\nMAC sublayer,\
    \ routing protocols in multi-hop wireless networks have also been extensively\n\
    studied. We start by providing several milestones in the context of data gathering\
    \ in\nWSNs. We continue with more recent studies which mainly include enhancements\
    \ to the\naforementioned protocol, taking into account new challenges such as\
    \ scalability demands\nand energy-related advances which present new opportunities\
    \ yet impose new constraints.\nWe continue with studies that leverage the multi-hop\
    \ topology to realize a network-coding\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n4 of 44\nmechanism.\
    \ Finally, we discuss a new paradigm that extends the traditional setup in which\n\
    the sensed data need to be routed toward a static central monitoring station (sink),\
    \ and\nutilize a mobile sink (or sinks) that traverse the terrain and can help\
    \ in collecting the devices’\nreports. We review several state-of-the-art schemes\
    \ in this mobile sink paradigm.\nThe ﬁnal section of this survey is dedicated\
    \ to wearable technology in the form of\nsmart devices that are attached to the\
    \ human body to monitor the user and their envi-\nronment. Wearable technology\
    \ involves challenges in all the aspects discussed in the\nprevious sections,\
    \ yet they introduce new opportunities for high-demand applications with\nunique\
    \ performance requirements and constraints. Even though we do not attempt to\n\
    provide a comprehensive review of the numerous applications suggested over the\
    \ years, we\nemphasize this prominent application layer and discuss several applications\
    \ in Section 6.\nAs previously explained, we roughly partitioned the topics covered\
    \ in this survey\nbased on the communication layers and organized the sections\
    \ accordingly. We note\nthat this partition is somehow artiﬁcial, as many innovations\
    \ in data-gathering involve\nmore than one layer. Furthermore, many technological\
    \ advances and research areas affect\nmultiple domains in different layers and\
    \ are visited in more than one section. Figure 1\ndepicts the schematic structure\
    \ of the paper. In the ﬁgure, the ovals represent the main\nresearch domains covered\
    \ in the paper. The hexagons represent the most prominent\nresearch tool innovations\
    \ and techniques utilized by data-gathering, which are covered in\nthe paper.\
    \ The arrows represent the inter-relation between them. For example, technologies\n\
    such as energy harvesting (EH) or Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    (AI) are utilized by innovations in all the layers starting from the platform\
    \ hardware to\nthe application layer. However, network coding is mainly utilized\
    \ by the network layer.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is leveraged by both the\

    \ Concepts\nOur primary focus in this survey is data gathering in the context\
    \ of wireless commu-\nnication networks. The units that generate the data (typically\
    \ sensors) are application-\ndependent and can serve a large variety of realms,\
    \ e.g., health, environmental, activity\nmonitoring, etc. Even though the sensing\
    \ unit is the essence, we will not cover it thor-\noughly, and we will only skim\
    \ through it sporadically when discussing applications and\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n5 of 44\ntheir speciﬁc requirements. Nonetheless, the term “sensor” typically\
    \ refers to the whole\nplatform or device in which the sensing unit is only one\
    \ component out of many, such as\nprocessing unit, transceiver unit, power unit,\
    \ antenna, and more, several of which can be\nintegrated into the device according\
    \ to the particular application needs. The sensing unit\nitself has its own requirements\
    \ and constraints, and in many situations cannot be altered.\nIn addition, the\
    \ integrated unit architecture and the platform design can be subject to\nvarious\
    \ stringent constraints. For example, size requirements can impose a strict constraint\n\
    on the device design; low power consumption, low production cost, and self-operation\
    \ can\nrepresent additional constraints. Accordingly, the device architecture\
    \ is fundamental and\naffects many other factors in the system. For example, power\
    \ supply affects the life span\n(or the time needed to replace the batteries);\
    \ it also affects transmission range, memory,\nand processing unit, which in turn\
    \ can affect the algorithms that can be executed on the\ndevice, etc.\nExtensive\
    \ research has been conducted on the design and architecture of the end\ndevice\
    \ and the infrastructure. We leave a detailed description of the basic components\
    \ such\nas the sensing unit, transceiver, antenna, processing unit, etc., as well\
    \ as the underlying\nhardware beyond the scope of this survey. To this end, the\
    \ objective of the rest of this section\nrefers to how data-gathering objectives\
    \ may impact both the design of speciﬁc sensors\nand the WSN infrastructure. By\
    \ the latter, we mean topology, system organization used to\ngather the data,\
    \ and algorithms to implement the data gathering. It is noteworthy that the\n\
    sensors’ characteristics also dictate the topology and, consequently, the data\
    \ aggregation\nalgorithms. In the sequel, we mention several platform architecture\
    \ designs as well as\nseveral network-wide architectures, mostly from recent years.\
    \ Additional similar studies\nappear throughout the survey, yet they are organized\
    \ in chapters according to the area in\nwhich they propose the most signiﬁcant\
    \ novelty. Figure 2 presents a schematic description\nof the section. Since several\
    \ papers presented in this section cover more than one topic, and\nsince, as previously\
    \ mentioned, this section is not presumed to provide an exhaustive list\nof all\
    \ papers or topics covered by the scope of WSN architecture, and some of the topics\
    \ are\nnot covered at all or covered by only a few representative papers, the\
    \ description is broad\nand only highlights the main topics covered in the section.\n\

    \ topics covered in the section.\n2.1. Application-Oriented\nMany sensor platforms\
    \ are application-oriented. Occasionally, their suggested ar-\nchitecture can\
    \ be applied to other applications; however, their design and evaluation are\n\
    typically aimed at a speciﬁc one. Hence, in many cases, both hardware and software\n\
    technological developments are introduced for effective functioning. One of the\
    \ most\ncommon tasks of WSN is the obvious one of monitoring a terrain. There\
    \ are many variants\nof WSN monitoring. For example, the requirement can be to\
    \ monitor every point in the\nField of Interest (FoI) vs. monitoring a limited\
    \ number of speciﬁc locations or targets (aka\ntarget coverage) vs. just monitoring\
    \ a border of a region to detect intruders (aka barrier\ncoverage). The coverage\
    \ problem typically involves selecting a subset of sensors that fulﬁll\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n6 of 44\nthe monitoring objective while maintaining network\
    \ connectivity. The sensors’ capabilities\nand the monitoring objective determine\
    \ the network topology.\nWe present several recent examples that mainly concentrate\
    \ on connectivity and data\ngathering under the constraints of the monitoring\
    \ objective. Biswas et al. [25] focus on\nenergy-efﬁcient data gathering in target\
    \ coverage problem, in which an n sensor WSN\nneeds to monitor T speciﬁc targets,\
    \ and there exists a route (multi-hop) from each source to\nthe sink. The paper\
    \ assumes that the source nodes that sense the targets and initiate data\npackets\
    \ into the network are known, and deals with the forwarding of these packets to\n\
    the sink. The paper proposes a distributed data gathering algorithm in which after\
    \ each\nnode discovers its neighbors and their hop-count to the sink, it will\
    \ forward data packets\n(when required) to its neighbor with maximum remaining\
    \ energy and a lower hop count\nto the sink (the remaining energy is assumed to\
    \ be known). Ammari [26] focuses on the\nk-coverage problem in which each point\
    \ in the FoI is required to be covered by at least k\nsensors at any time, and\
    \ each active sensor participating in the monitoring task is required\nto be connected\
    \ to the sink (possibly via a multi-hop route). The paper assumes that the\nsensors\
    \ are heterogeneous (they do not have the same characteristics) and mobile, hence\n\
    the sensors can move toward any region of interest in the deployment ﬁeld to participate\
    \ in\nany deﬁcient k-coverage area and can also act as mobile proxy sinks that\
    \ collect sensed data\nfrom the sensors and deliver them to the sink. Ammari [26]\
    \ partitions the problem into\ntwo problems which are solved sequentially. Namely,\
    \ the mobile k-coverage problem, which\nselects a minimum subset of active sensors\
    \ that solve the k-coverage problem and the data\ngathering problem, and devise\
    \ a forwarding scheme from the active sensors to the sink such\nthat the energy\
    \ consumption due to sensor mobility and communication is minimized.\nMdemaya\
    \ and Bomgni [27] utilize mobile sensors to achieve area coverage. These\nmobile\
    \ sensors can be moved and relocated to cover holes after the random deployment.\n\
    The authors suggest a two-phase approach. According to the ﬁrst one, the monitoring\n\
    area after the initial random deployment is identiﬁed (by the BS), and mobile\
    \ nodes are\nrelocated to cover the monitoring holes detected after the initial\
    \ deployment, trying to\nensure full coverage of the AoI by the static and relocated\
    \ sensors. At the second stage, the\nproposed algorithm schedules the sensors’\
    \ activity (awakening and transmission times)\nthat minimizes the energy consumption\
    \ of the nodes while collecting and sending data\nto the base station. To this\
    \ end, the paper distinguishes between “normal” nodes and\ncluster heads. A survey\
    \ that reviews algorithms and techniques related to the connectivity-\ncoverage\
    \ issues in WSN can be found in Boukerche and Sun [28].\nOccasionally, WSN architectures\
    \ and designs are more application-oriented. For\nexample, Cerchecci et al. [29]\
    \ propose a sensor node topology that uses low-cost and low-\npower components\
    \ for energy-efﬁcient waste management in the context of smart cities.\nThe architecture\
    \ described in [29] suggests a node architecture for measuring the ﬁlling\nlevel\
    \ of trash bins and utilizes LoRa LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) technology\n\
    for real-time data transmission to collect the measured data in a remote data\
    \ collection\ncenter. The design of a sensor node that can detect the presence\
    \ of water on home ﬂoors and\nprovide early warning of water leaks is suggested\
    \ by Teixidó et al. [30]. The paper presents\nand deploys both hardware and software\
    \ of the network components (ﬂood sensing nodes,\nactuator nodes, and a control\
    \ central); communication within the sensor network relies\non the IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. Borrero and Zabalo [31] present a low-cost agriculture-\noriented\
    \ system. The suggested system is based on LoRa technology and can collect various\n\
    measurements, such as humidity, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and temperature,\n\
    and enables a farmer to access all of the information necessary to achieve efﬁcient\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement of crops in real time. The developed wireless sensor\
    \ node has been optimized\nboth in hardware and software and exhibits very low\
    \ power consumption.\n2.2. Energy-Harvesting (EH)\nOne of the main concerns of\
    \ the sensor platform’s design is the source of energy.\nTypically, the energy\
    \ source is a battery attached to the sensor platform. It is utilized to\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n7 of 44\nprovide power to all the required operations, e.g.,\
    \ wireless transmission, computation,\nmemory, etc. The battery properties (e.g.,\
    \ technology used and size) can determine its\nlifespan as well as several other\
    \ properties, e.g., transmission range. In many systems,\nthe battery is a burden,\
    \ as it increases the cost of the system, constrains the platform size,\nand most\
    \ importantly, requires to be replaced occasionally. The challenge of saving power\n\
    spans all the protocol stack; energy considerations show up in each part of this\
    \ survey. As\nwith the other layers, PHY layer innovations have also been suggested\
    \ as to how to utilize\nbattery power efﬁciently.\nAn alternative approach to\
    \ overcome the battery hurdle is to embed a mechanism\nthat harvests energy. Such\
    \ a mechanism can be embedded alongside the battery to ex-\ntend its lifespan,\
    \ or more commonly, it can completely replace the battery so that all the\nfunctions\
    \ rely on it. Batteryless WSNs that rely solely on energy-harvesting (EH)-WSN\n\
    can compromise performance; for example, their transmission range can be shorter,\
    \ the\navailable energy can constrain their awake time, and so on. One of the\
    \ main challenges is to\nlocate the ambient resource from which the energy can\
    \ be harvested. Many studies have ex-\nplored different energy sources that can\
    \ supplement energy, such as solar, vibration, wind,\nmotion, electromagnetic,\
    \ and more. Numerous comprehensive technological overviews\nwith their advantages\
    \ and limitations, energy harvesting modeling, challenge expectations,\nand prospects\
    \ can be found in, for example, Refs. [32–37]. A more recent system design\nreview\
    \ on battery-free and energy-aware WSNs, which utilize ambient energy or wireless\n\
    energy transmission, is given in [38]. It addresses energy supply strategies and\
    \ provides\ninsight into energy management methods and possibilities for energy\
    \ saving at the node\nand network levels.\nKhalid et al. [39] suggest a zero-power\
    \ wireless sensor architecture that consists of\na capacitive sensor (a sensor\
    \ that associates the parameter of interest with the change in\nthe capacitance),\
    \ an RFID chip, a circulator (allows power ﬂow between three deﬁned\nports), and\
    \ an antenna (batteryless). The conceptual idea is that the sensor reﬂects the\n\
    signal received from the RFID, with a change in phase, which is relative to the\
    \ sensed value.\nDesign and implementation of an energetically autonomous WSN\
    \ platform for ambient\nmonitoring in indoor environments are suggested by Abella\
    \ et al. [40]. The proposed self-\npowered autonomous sensor node platform relies\
    \ on embedded photo-voltaic (PV) panels\nto harvest the energy, a microcontroller\
    \ and an RF transceiver with an attached antenna.\nThe suggested architecture\
    \ was prototyped and validated experimentally. Lee et al. [41]\npropose a ﬂoating\
    \ wireless device with energy harvesting capability. The ﬂoating device is\nenergetically\
    \ self-sustaining for extended operational hours. It supports long-range com-\n\
    munication between wireless sensor nodes and a gateway relying on the LoRa technology\n\
    while deployed over a water surface. The ﬂoating device can be used as an environmental\n\
    monitoring station to remotely collect weather and water quality information.\
    \ Ref. [42]\npresent the design of a wireless sensor node, powered by solar energy,\
    \ that collects en-\nvironmental data and can transmit it across vast distances\
    \ (directly to the cloud). The\narchitecture presented therein relies on low-power\
    \ wide-area network (LPWAN) protocols\nthat provide a long-range communication\
    \ system with limited data to transmit and high\nenergy efﬁciency. The authors\
    \ utilize Sigfox technology in their proof-of-concept design.\nAs previously mentioned\
    \ in numerous papers, surveys and tutorials exploring dif-\nferent aspects of\
    \ energy harvesting in WSN exist (a sliver of which we present herein).\nWe will\
    \ revisit EH when we discuss various aspects of data aggregation, such as routing\n\
    enhancement for EH-WSN (under EH constraints), on which we elaborate in Section\
    \ 5.2 or\nwhen discussing wearables in Section 6.\n2.3. Topology\nThroughout the\
    \ survey, the interaction of WSN and IoT will arise in multiple contexts.\nWhile\
    \ this survey mainly deals with data gathering by means of wireless units, an\
    \ IoT unit\npresumes a more high-level entity for localized data gathering. To\
    \ assess the connection\nbetween these two concepts, the reader is advised to\
    \ refer to the most recent work by\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n8 of 44\nDevadas et\
    \ al. [43], for example, where the authors enumerate the IoT data management\n\
    frameworks, challenges and issues. The chapter focuses on three layers of data\
    \ management\nin IoT networks, communication, storage and processing. In addition,\
    \ deployment of IoT\nData management for smart home and smart city is described.\n\
    It is essential to distinguish between a one-directional WSN platform, where sensors\n\
    merely gather the data and activate a speciﬁc infrastructure and set of technologies\
    \ to further\nsend it to a sink, and a bi-directional WSN platform, where the\
    \ sensors are expected to be\nable to act according to control messages received\
    \ from a sink. In the latter case, the sink\nmight be a higher-level entity (e.g.,\
    \ a cloud-based server). While the general data-gathering\ntechniques are usually\
    \ agnostic of the control direction, additional constraints might be\nimposed.\
    \ Delay of the responses, latency, BW usage efﬁciency, security, and privacy are\n\
    some of the demands to consider. Another example of a bi-directional platform\
    \ can be\nseen in social sensor clouds (SSC), which connect a social network with\
    \ a sensor network\nvia a cloud infrastructure. See, for example, Zhu et al. [44],\
    \ which presents a scenario of a\nsmart village and provides discussion on various\
    \ aspects including green planning, energy\nconcerns, and speed of data gathering\
    \ and sharing. In Dinh and Kim [45], an on-demand\nWSN platform is designed. The\
    \ authors suggest a data-gathering protocol that addresses\nbandwidth consumption\
    \ and delivery latency and minimizes the number of requests\nto save resources.\
    \ An infrastructure where sensors form groups belonging to private\nowners constitutes\
    \ a special case. This may be the case in a smart city environment; this\nmeans\
    \ that privacy and/or security considerations should be prioritized. This is the\
    \ topic\naddressed by Zhu et al. [46]. The authors provide a trust-assisted cloud\
    \ for WSN but have\nthroughput issues in mind. Kuo et al. [47] suggest a WSN-based\
    \ IoT platform that provides\na reliable connection between sensors in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the database on the Internet. The\nproposed platform is based on the IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4e time-slotted channel-hopping protocol\nwith resource-constrained devices\
    \ supporting heterogeneous applications. The paper\nsuggests a scheme that compensates\
    \ the clock drift for every timeslot to maintain the clock\nsynchronization required\
    \ for the time-slotted channel-hopping protocol.\nEdge computing, as discussed\
    \ by Satyanarayanan [48], allows distributing the data\ngathering burden across\
    \ multiple cloudlets, which might be highly beneﬁcial for large\nWSN. This platform\
    \ paradigm aims to improve many important aspects: reduced latency\nof data delivery,\
    \ increased bandwidth, scalability, resilience to possible cloud outages,\nand\
    \ privacy control. However, the platform presumes an initial capital investment\
    \ and\nlater maintenance.\nA virtual sensor network was proposed by Abdelwahab\
    \ et al. [49]. Once a user-\ninitiated sensing request is dispatched to a cloud,\
    \ a suitable set of sensors is found for\nthe task. The decision is made according\
    \ to the cost function, which depends on the\nspeciﬁc (e.g., monetary) cost of\
    \ using sensors from the designated set, the beneﬁt that\ncan be received from\
    \ using these sensors, and their effectiveness in distances and delays\n(calculated,\
    \ e.g., in number of hops from sensor to a sink/gateway), also expressed as\n\
    virtual links. The cost might be customized, while a general virtualization problem\
    \ is\nformulated and the algorithm is provided.\nIntegration of unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) and WSN for crop monitoring in\nprecision agriculture is described\
    \ by Popescu et al. [50]. The authors suggest a down-up\nscheme, where the collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level to the\ncluster head\
    \ (CH) level, then collected by the UAV level and ﬁnally delivered to the cloud\n\
    for analysis and possible feedback. Particular emphasis is put on outlying measurements\n\
    from speciﬁc sensors, as they can indicate either a possible sensor failure or\
    \ an upcoming\nunusual event inside the agricultural ﬁeld. The measured data were\
    \ processed through a\nconsensus algorithm. Concurrently, it suppressed outlier\
    \ values left for further examination\nfor the cloud-based analysis. In addition,\
    \ this study focused on the UAV trajectory planning\nto collect the data observed\
    \ by the WSN. Actual deployment with several tens of sensors\nand several CHs\
    \ is provided and analyzed. Note that we dedicate Section 5.4 to data\ngathering\
    \ assisted by a mobile unit.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n9 of 44\nAn implementation\
    \ of a ubiquitous consumer data service for transmitting short mes-\nsages to\
    \ any computing platform is provided by Datta et al. [51]. The authors demonstrate\n\
    a data cycle model that allows any device with sensor(s) to report data encoded\
    \ in short\nmessages. The raw data reaches a central or distributed computing\
    \ platform, where it\nundergoes transformation and evolves into rich and structured\
    \ valuable information for\nhigher-layer applications. The proposed data cycle\
    \ model and DataTweet architecture are\naimed at smart city and large-scale crowd-sensing-based\
    \ IoT scenarios.\n2.4. Application-Oriented Network Architecture\nWe continue\
    \ by covering special types of WSN platforms for data gathering and\nspecialized\
    \ application-driven architecture types. Ayele et al. [52] suggest an IoT network\n\
    architecture for wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) for scenarios in which animals\
    \ exhibit\nsparse mobility, which results in sporadic wireless links. In addition,\
    \ they suggest a\ndata forwarding enhancement that adopts the ﬂood-store-carry-and-forward\
    \ paradigm\nsuggested in the seminal ZebraNet study by Juang et al. [53], in which\
    \ in order to send data\nto the sink, the nodes disseminate it among themselves\
    \ until it reaches the sink. Speciﬁcally,\neach node stores the data needing to\
    \ be conveyed, waits for connectivity with other nodes,\nand distributes the data\
    \ to them, and they repeat the same process. Accordingly, the data is\nspread\
    \ throughout the entire network (i.e., ﬂooding) and will eventually be received\
    \ by the\nsink. The authors in [52] suggest leveraging locally available routing\
    \ parameters to improve\nopportunistic data forwarding algorithms by managing\
    \ the data replication decision.\nSaleh et al. [54] suggest extending the lifetime\
    \ of a wireless sensor network used in\nmobile healthcare applications by increasing\
    \ the number of bits transmitted per symbol, and\nspeciﬁcally to rely on a quaternary\
    \ interconnect scheme in which each transmitted symbol\nmodulates two bits. A\
    \ complementary neural network, static RAM-based architecture is\nsuggested to\
    \ reduce energy consumption in storage and transmissions during the data\ndissemination\
    \ process. A WSN dedicated to home deployment for elderly healthcare and\nearly\
    \ health emergency alarm is discussed by Alsina-Pagès et al. [55]. The authors\
    \ ﬁrst raise\nprivacy concerns related to the monitoring, and accordingly, advocate\
    \ that only sound-\nbased surveillance aimed to merely indicate alarming situations\
    \ is appropriate. In order\nto further conform to the privacy demands, they focus\
    \ on distributed architecture (rather\nthan on a centralized one), where each\
    \ of the WSN sensors sends encrypted identiﬁers of\ntheir measurement. The identiﬁcation\
    \ of events is built on feature extraction. This is done\non the frequency domain\
    \ by ﬁrst dividing the incoming signal into blocks with Hamming\nsliding window,\
    \ then transforming into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier\nTransform\
    \ (DFT) to evaluate the contribution of every band of the spectrum. The ﬁnal\n\
    coefﬁcients are obtained after Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The conclusive\
    \ parts of the\nproposed algorithm classify the coefﬁcients, feeding them into\
    \ Support Vector Machines\nwhich classiﬁes the estimated audio event. The authors\
    \ assert that the classiﬁcation results\ncould be further improved by incorporating\
    \ a deep artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) into\ntheir system.\nIn AbeBer et al.\
    \ [56], a similar method was implemented for urban noise monitoring.\nNamely,\
    \ while STFT was utilized for the noise preprocessing, the classiﬁcation of noise\n\
    levels and events was performed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors\n\
    used several previously published networks; see references therein. Similar methods\
    \ for\nnoise monitoring WSN were introduced by Siamwala et al. [57]. The frequency-domain\n\
    analysis was performed. Then, classiﬁcation by statistical methods was accomplished\n\
    (Gaussian mixture model was used). In addition, the authors in [57] provide an\
    \ elaborate\nWSN architecture, where energy-harvesting solar panels augment the\
    \ sensors’ lifetime and\nthe sensors’ state-of-charge is transmitted and tracked\
    \ by central, more powerful nodes.\n3. Compressed Sensing\nMany data-gathering\
    \ applications rely on numerous self-powered smart devices to\ncollect real-time\
    \ data and convey it via a wireless medium to a central entity or entities\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n10 of 44\n(e.g., the cloud) to further process it and act upon\
    \ it. Such devices are expected to perform\ntwo basic operations—sensing and wireless\
    \ connectivity. Two important hindering aspects\nthat derive from these operations\
    \ inﬂuence the performance and need to be considered\nare: (i) energy consumption\
    \ associated with these two operations, especially when many of\nthese devices\
    \ are typically simple with limited computation abilities and battery lifetime\n\
    (ii) airtime utilization, which can also degrade the performance causing high\
    \ delays, jitter,\nbattery consumption, etc. Accordingly, one of the main challenges\
    \ in combating these\nlimitations is reducing the report payload, which affects\
    \ each report’s transmission time\nand channel utilization. Reducing the payload\
    \ of the sensed data can be accomplished at\ndifferent levels; it can be done\
    \ in the sensing stage by reducing the size of the sensed data, as\nwell as in\
    \ the report preparing stage by compressing the report size, and in the transmission\n\
    stage, by selecting which devices need to send reports, thus limiting redundant\
    \ information.\nWhen the reports need to travel multiple hops before reaching\
    \ their destination, this can\nbe done at the relay stage by pruning, unifying,\
    \ and compressing reports. In the sequel,\nwe discuss Compressed Sensing (CS).\
    \ This novel paradigm can reduce report payload at\nseveral levels mentioned above,\
    \ hence lowering the sensing operation’s transmission time\nand energy consumption.\n\
    Compressed sensing is a signal-processing technique that is most advantageous\
    \ when\nthe subject signal is sparse in some domain, such that a minimal non-zero\
    \ vector of coefﬁ-\ncients can represent it. The signal sparsity enables a high-quality\
    \ reconstruction, which is\nattained by ﬁnding the solution to an under-determined\
    \ linear system of equations with\nthe smallest possible number of non-zero values.\
    \ Thus, a convex minimization problem\nneeds to be solved to perform the recovery.\
    \ Note that the CS technique performs non-\nuniform sampling of the data signal\
    \ with an average sample rate usually smaller than\nthe minimal rate mandated\
    \ by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. A detailed view\nof the technique can\
    \ be found in Balouchestani et al. [58] and Donoho [59]. Various net-\nworking\
    \ domains can utilize compressed sensing, for example, Feizi et al. [60] depict\
    \ some\napplications of CS over networks and elucidate the connection between\
    \ CS and traditional\ninformation-theoretic techniques in source coding and channel\
    \ coding. Particularly, CS is\nhighly suitable for sensed data gathering in wireless\
    \ sensor networks (e.g., physical phe-\nnomena or a scenery), as it can leverage\
    \ the expected high spatial and temporal correlation\nbetween sensing reports\
    \ sent by neighboring sensors at different times in order to acquire\nthe CS paradigm’s\
    \ desired sparsity. In the following, we review several such data-gathering\n\
    schemes that utilize CS.\nLuo et al. [61,62] consider a densely deployed monitoring\
    \ sensor network in which\nreports traverse multiple hops before reaching their\
    \ destination, a sink. These studies\nrely on the concept that sensors’ readings\
    \ are spatially correlated; hence, there exists a\ntransform domain in which the\
    \ sensed signals can be sparsely represented. Both propose\na compressive data-gathering\
    \ (CDG) procedure in which sensors distributively encode\ntheir reports by projecting\
    \ them on a random space basis using random coefﬁcients. These\nencoded reports\
    \ can be decoded at the sink using compressive sensing techniques. Specif-\nically,\
    \ CDG is designed for multi-hop networks where messages need to travel multiple\n\
    hops before reaching their destination. The sampling process that characterizes\
    \ the CS\ncompression process is performed individually at each sensor by simple\
    \ multiplications\nand additions. Particularly, CDG suggests that rather than\
    \ forwarding individual sensor\nreadings, each sensor uses each of its reports\
    \ (measurements) to construct and send M\ndifferent messages, each comprising\
    \ a weighted sum of the sensor’s own report with other\nsensors’ reports traversing\
    \ it (relaying). Formally, denote by vector d = [d1, d2, . . . , dN]T\nthe measurements\
    \ (readings) obtained by all the sensors, where N is the number of nodes in\n\
    the WSN and di denotes the measurement (reading) obtained by sensor si. The sink\
    \ obtains\nM messages (weighted sums) represented by the vector y = Φd = φ1d1,\
    \ φ2d2, . . . , φNdN,\nwhere Φ is an M × N (M << N) matrix comprising the series\
    \ of coefﬁcients generated\nby the sensors, and in particular, φi is the i-th\
    \ column vector of Φ, which denotes the\nrandom coefﬁcients selected by sensor\
    \ i. Luo et al. [61] suggest that the measurement\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n11\
    \ of 44\nmatrix (coefﬁcients matrix) Φ should be a full random matrix with its\
    \ entries being i.i.d.\nGaussian random numbers drawn according to N (0, 1\nM).\
    \ The paper suggests that each\nweighted sum coefﬁcient be chosen pseudo-randomly\
    \ based on each sensor’s ID in order\nto avoid the burden and high overhead required\
    \ to collect these coefﬁcients by the sink\nif they are chosen randomly. Ref.\
    \ [62] extends the random coefﬁcient selection suggested\nin [61] to an only partly\
    \ random matrix in which the entries of a sub-matrix are still drawn\naccording\
    \ to N (0, 1\nM). Yet, for the rest of the matrix, two options are suggested,\
    \ either an\nupper triangular matrix with non-zero entries drawn according to\
    \ N (0, 1\nM), or the identity\nmatrix. CDG exploits the compressive sampling\
    \ theory and shows that when the sensor\nreadings are compressible, the sink will\
    \ be able to accurately recover the reports even when\nthe number of weighted\
    \ sums (messages) each sensor generates for each report (M) is\nmuch lower than\
    \ the number of reporting sensors (N). For example, on a route comprising\nN sensors,\
    \ the sink needs to collect only M << N messages to encode the information sent\n\
    by all the N sensors.\nSeveral studies further explore the sparsity of the sensed\
    \ signal and its projection\nmatrix, as well as the number of messages (M) that\
    \ should be delivered to the sink. For\nexample, Wang et al. [63] argue that most\
    \ natural signals are nonstationary and ordinarily\nvariable in the temporal and\
    \ spatial domains. In CS, these directly inﬂuence the recon-\nstruction process\
    \ and the number of required measurements; consequently, setting a ﬁxed\nnumber\
    \ of measurements with a ﬁxed transform basis (coefﬁcient matrix Φ) can result\n\
    in poor performance (inaccurate measurement reconstruction). Accordingly, Ref.\
    \ [63]\nsuggests an adaptive data-gathering scheme based on CS, which utilizes\
    \ an autoregressive\n(AR) model to exploit the local spatial correlation between\
    \ sensed data of neighboring\nsensor nodes. The suggested reconstruction scheme\
    \ adapts to the variation of sensed data\nby adjusting the AR parameters. The\
    \ number of measurements is adjusted adaptively\nwith the sensed data by evaluating\
    \ the recovery result and approximating the number of\nmeasurements required to\
    \ satisfy the accuracy demand.\nTo reduce the transmission overhead, Xu et al.\
    \ [64] propose the compressed sparse\nfunction (CSF) scheme. The basic concept\
    \ of CSF is, rather than encode the sensed data\nby projecting it on a basis on\
    \ which it can be represented sparsely, as in typical CS-based\nschemes, to compress\
    \ the sensed data in the form of sparse functions, which are sent to the\nsource.\
    \ The source can recover the function using techniques from polynomial approxi-\n\
    mation/interpolation theory and use them to compute data values that were not\
    \ reported.\nSpeciﬁcally, CSF ﬁnds a function that maps the sensors’ identiﬁers\
    \ and their readings, which\ncan be expressed in a very sparse way, and only communicates\
    \ this function to the sink.\nAfter the sink recovers the function, it can recover\
    \ all the N sensor readings. Xu et al. [64]\nshow that the CSF approach can provide\
    \ good recovery accuracy (better than the CDG\nscheme suggested by [61]) while\
    \ substantially reducing the message overhead (mainly in\ntree-structured networks).\
    \ Li et al. [65] present a general CS framework for WSNs and IoT\nand show how\
    \ the proposed framework can be utilized to reconstruct the compressible\ninformation.\
    \ The suggested framework comprises three phases: (i) information sensing\nto\
    \ detect and compressively sample event signals; (ii) compressed sampling, in\
    \ which the\nsystem samples information traversing the networks; and (iii) reconstruction\
    \ algorithms, in\nwhich the system accurately reconstructs the original signal\
    \ from the compressed samples.\nDifferent studies tackle the sampling issue and\
    \ suggest different approaches to reduce\nthe number of reports sent such that\
    \ only a subset of the sensors sense the object or\nphenomenon at a time. Several\
    \ studies explore how sensed data is conveyed to the sink\nwith the insight that\
    \ the compression is at least attained along the path to the sink, and is\ntherefore\
    \ affected by it. For example, Dhanapala et al. [66] show that a random-walk-based\n\
    sampling, rather than the conventional uniform-sampling-based CS for function\
    \ recovery,\ncan be used for phenomena awareness either at a sink or at other\
    \ sensors without a sink,\nwith minimal additional sampling. As the distribution\
    \ of the samples has a signiﬁcant effect\non the recovery, Ref. [66] suggests\
    \ an upper bound for the probability of successful recovery\nwith a given error\
    \ percentage. The derived bound provides an approximate number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n12 of 44\nsamples required to recover a function under a selected\
    \ basis and a sampling scheme.\nZheng et al. [67] further argue that random walk\
    \ provides a more practical approach for\nthe data-gathering application in WSNs\
    \ and explores the sparsity of collecting non-uniform\nmeasurements while sampling\
    \ along multiple random paths. The paper suggests that\nthe M × N measurement\
    \ matrix will be characterized by M independent random walks.\nSpeciﬁcally, each\
    \ of the M matrix rows corresponds to the set of vertices visited by the\nrespective\
    \ random walk. The paper analyzes the required number of random walks (M)\nand\
    \ their corresponding lengths (how many entries on each row are non-zero) under\
    \ the\nproposed random walk algorithm.\nZheng et al. [68] suggest a cluster-based\
    \ data-gathering mechanism, in which the\nterrain is divided into cells; in each\
    \ cell, a node is randomly selected as the cell head,\nwhich collects the data\
    \ from the cell members and forwards it to the sink. Zheng et al. [68]\nsuggest\
    \ two forwarding mechanisms, one relying on centrally deﬁned tree-based for-\n\
    warding, and another that is a gossip-based approach. The projection process is\
    \ similar\nto Luo et al. [61,62], being based on random coefﬁcients. Another clustering-based\
    \ hi-\nerarchical data aggregation protocol that relies on CS, termed HDACS, is\
    \ suggested by\nXu et al. [69]. Speciﬁcally, HDACS constructs a multilevel hierarchical\
    \ structure and adap-\ntively sets multiple compression thresholds based on cluster\
    \ sizes at different levels of the\ndata aggregation tree to optimize the amount\
    \ of transmitted data. The encoding procedure\nis adapted from [62], where each\
    \ cluster-head recovers (decodes) all received messages\nfrom its descendants\
    \ (retrieves the original data) before compressing and sending it to its\nparent\
    \ cluster-head.\nMotivated by reducing power consumption, Lan and Wei [70] also\
    \ suggest a\ncompressibility-based clustering algorithm for hierarchical compressive\
    \ data gathering. In\nthis study, the network is decomposed into a logical chain,\
    \ and sensor nodes are grouped\nbased on the compressibility of their readings\
    \ instead of by a random clustering approach.\nThis clustering approach strives\
    \ to minimize the average compression ratio of all clusters by\ngreedily selecting\
    \ the set of nodes based on the compression ratio. It then tries to maximize\n\
    the number of compressible clusters so as to determine the suitable transmission\
    \ mode\nfor each cluster using a mode threshold that is a function of the number\
    \ of nodes and the\nnumber of hops from a cluster-head to a sink.\nTo reduce the\
    \ number of sensors involved in each CS measurement, Wu et al. [71]\npropose a\
    \ sparsest random scheduling scheme for compressive data gathering in large-\n\
    scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), leveraging the spatial-temporal properties\
    \ in the\nsensory data. The central theme of this study is that the measurement\
    \ matrix is designed\nbased on the representation basis and sensory data and according\
    \ to the sensor network\nrequirements rather than the network environment. By\
    \ combining compressed sensing\nand network coding in the data-gathering scheme,\
    \ Yin et al. [72] introduce a multi-hop\ntopology in which the sink node adaptively\
    \ adjusts the measurement formation according\nto the reconstruction of received\
    \ measurements at each data-gathering epoch. The sink\nnode dictates the data\
    \ aggregation performed to balance the energy consumption among\nsensor nodes.\n\
    Xu et al. [73] exploit the CS paradigm for network tomography. Speciﬁcally, Ref.\
    \ [73]\nleverages the fact that, typically, only a small fraction of network entities\
    \ such as links or\nnodes are responsible for anomalies or degradation in network\
    \ performance, as a limited\nnumber of congested links can be responsible for\
    \ signiﬁcant delays or high packet drop\nrates, and suggests utilizing CS theory\
    \ in order to identify these few entities based on end-\nto-end measurements.\
    \ Zheng et al. [74] provide an analysis of the capacity and delay of\ndata gathering\
    \ with compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks. The paper considers\n\
    a random topology where sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region, for both\n\
    single-sink and multi-sink scenarios, and characterizes the capacity and delay\
    \ performance\nimprovement that the CS paradigm can achieve for data gathering.\
    \ In particular, for\nthe single sink, a simple routing scheme for data gathering\
    \ with CS is suggested, and\na tight capacity in the order sense is presented.\
    \ In particular, the suggested routing\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n13 of 44\nscheme\
    \ with pipelining scheduling algorithm for data gathering shows that the proposed\n\
    single-sink scheme can achieve a capacity gain of Θ( n\nM) over the baseline transmission\n\
    scheme, and the delay can be reduced by a factor of Θ(\n√\nnlogn\nM\n), where\
    \ M is the number\nof random projections required for reconstructing a snapshot,\
    \ and n is the number of\nrandomly deployed nodes. For the multi-sink case, their\
    \ architecture shows that the per-\nsession capacity of data gathering with CS\
    \ is Θ(\nn√nW\nMnd\n√\nnslogn), and the per-session delay is\nΘ(M\nq\nn\nlogn),\
    \ where W is the data rate. The number of sinks present in the network is nd,\n\
    and the number of randomly selected source nodes is ns. They validate the theoretical\n\
    results with simulations for the scaling laws of the capacity in both single-sink\
    \ and multi-\nsink networks.\n4. Medium Access Control (MAC)\nNext, we move to\
    \ the Data-Link layer and speciﬁcally to the medium access control\n(MAC) mechanism,\
    \ which highly affects the performance of data gathering protocols, as\nit inﬂuences\
    \ several performance aspects, such as reliability, latency, channel utilization,\n\
    power utilization (which impact the lifespan of a sensor in particular and the\
    \ network in\ngeneral), etc. Even though many access protocols were suggested\
    \ over the years for shared-\nchannel networks, wired and wireless, due to their\
    \ unique properties and requirements,\nextensive research has been conducted on\
    \ MAC protocols targeted to WSN. Many WSN\nMAC protocols were designed to comply\
    \ with various trafﬁc patterns. Accordingly, in the\nsequel, we provide a short\
    \ WSN-MAC protocol overview for ones that can support yet\nare not necessarily\
    \ particular to data-gathering. We review a fraction of the vast literature\n\
    on the topic and the numerous MAC protocols devised over the years. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ a\nschematic partition of the papers discussed throughout this section according\
    \ to the main\nMAC classes.\nMAC\nSection 4\nSynchronous \nTransmitter-Initiated\
    \ \nReceiver-Initiated \nAsynchronous \nOthers\nSection 4.2\nDuty-Cycle\nSection\
    \ 4.1\nFigure 3. Schematic description highlighting the main MAC classes covered\
    \ in the section.\nEnergy consumption is one of the main concerns of WSN, and\
    \ as previously explained,\nit needs to be considered in the design of protocols\
    \ and algorithms in all the layers of the\nprotocol stack. The highest energy\
    \ consumer of a sensor or an IoT device is its transceiver,\nwhich consumes energy\
    \ regardless of whether it is transmitting or only awake listening to\nongoing\
    \ trafﬁc (e.g., [75]). One of the more prevalent solutions to save power is to\
    \ embrace\na duty-cycle mechanism in which the device is asleep most of the time\
    \ (its transceiver is in\nlow power mode), and is awake for transmitting or receiving\
    \ data only a small fraction\nof the time. Another important aspect of wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSN) is channel\nutilization, that is, in a typical WSN, when\
    \ multiple devices are trying to send reports\nsimultaneously, air time is a crucial\
    \ network resource. Particularly when the network is\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    14 of 44\ndense with multiple devices in the same neighborhood, issues such as\
    \ coordinating between\nthe users to avoid collisions and preventing users from\
    \ occupying the channel for long\ntime intervals are fundamental. Note that such\
    \ issues can highly affect the performance in\na dense network topology even when\
    \ reports are not frequent. Accordingly, utilizing the\nchannel (air time) efﬁciently\
    \ is a crucial component for any such system’s operation and\nperformance. These\
    \ two highly vital aspects justify the signiﬁcance given to the design of\nmedium\
    \ access control (MAC) protocols that are particular to WSNs. Numerous protocols\n\
    have been suggested to cope with different WSN objectives and demands (e.g., [76,77]).\n\
    This paper focuses on MAC protocols for WSNs, particularly on duty-cycled-based\
    \ ones.\n4.1. Duty-Cycle MAC Protocols\nTraditionally, duty-cycle MAC protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed as either synchronous or\nasynchronous. In synchronous protocols\
    \ the awake time interval is synchronized such that\nall devices are awake (or\
    \ asleep) at the same time intervals (e.g., S-MAC [78], T-MAC [79]).\nSince the\
    \ awake time intervals are quite limited, they can be highly congested and prone\n\
    to collisions. Several synchronous protocols have devised mechanisms to attenuate\
    \ this\ncongestion and to allow more devices to transmit in each cycle, for example,\
    \ DW-MAC [80],\nwhich allocates the awake time for transmission reservations that\
    \ will be executed during\nthe sleep interval.\nIn asynchronous protocols, each\
    \ device has its own wake-up schedule. Accordingly,\nthe main challenge is setting\
    \ a rendezvous time when both the sender and the receiver are\nawake and devising\
    \ a signaling mechanism that informs both that they are awake and can\ncommunicate.\
    \ Asynchronous MAC protocols can further be divided into two categories,\ntransmitter-\
    \ or receiver-initiated. In transmitter-initiated protocols, the transmitter initiates\n\
    the transmission by capturing the channel waiting for its designated receiver\
    \ to wake\nup. For instance, in B-MAC [81], the transmitter transmits a long preamble\
    \ capturing the\nchannel prior to the data transmission, waiting for its intended\
    \ receiver to wake up and\nreply. In X-MAC [82], the transmitter transmits a sequence\
    \ of short preambles allowing\nthe intended receiver to interrupt, notifying the\
    \ receiver that it is awake. In WiseMAC [83],\nthe transmitter learns the wake-up\
    \ time of its intended receiver and starts the preamble\ntransmission just prior\
    \ to this wake-up time.\nThe second approach, the receiver-initiated paradigm,\
    \ relies on the receiver, whenever\nawake and ready to receive data, to initiate\
    \ the data exchange. The basic receiver-initiated\nMAC concept was introduced\
    \ in RI-MAC [84], in which whenever the receiver wakes up,\nit transmits a predeﬁned\
    \ preamble, signaling to its potential transmitters that it is awake\nand ready\
    \ to receive data. Several protocols took up the RI-MAC paradigm and suggested\n\
    modiﬁcations and enhancements. Some protocols strived to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    while a sender stays awake, waiting for its intended receiver to wake up. For\
    \ instance,\nPW-MAC [85] and AP-MAC [86] suggested that each transmitter will\
    \ learn its receiver’s\nexpected wake-up time, and instead of staying awake waiting\
    \ for its designated receiver to\nwake up, will wake up just before its intended\
    \ receiver’s wake-up instance.\nAnother receiver-initiated enhancement is suggested\
    \ by A-MAC [87], which aims to\nreduce the time in which a receiver and, consequently,\
    \ its potential transmitters stay awake,\nby trying to determine whether there\
    \ are pending packets for transmission and if it needs\nto stay awake or if it\
    \ can go back to sleep after probing the channel. The enhancement\nrelies on an\
    \ additional frame, termed “auto-ack”, sent by pending transmitters, which\nfollows\
    \ the receiver’s probe packet and proceeds with the data transmission. The “auto-ack”\n\
    frame is such that the receiver can decode a superposition of several such frames\
    \ and\ndetermine whether there is trafﬁc being sent. Even though the energy saved\
    \ per cycle is\nnegligible, the cumulative savings per day can be signiﬁcant due\
    \ to the numerous times\na device wakes up probing the channel. RIVER-MAC [88]\
    \ suggests two enhancements,\none aiming at reducing the awake time a sender is\
    \ waiting for its intended receiver to\nwake up, and one that aims at improving\
    \ the RI-MAC collision resolution mechanism by\nletting an active receiver keep\
    \ controlling the channel after invoking the collision resolution\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n15 of 44\nmechanism, and speciﬁcally during the silent backoff interval.\
    \ MAR-RiMAC [89] suggested\nan amendment to the receiver-initiated approach, and\
    \ in particular RI-MAC, to cope with\nthe perpetual collisions, common in dense\
    \ networks and heavy trafﬁc loads, in which\nmany devices are trying to transmit\
    \ to the same entity (sink or relay). MAR-RiMAC relies\non a reservation-based\
    \ mechanism in which the reservations are short signals that can\nbe transmitted\
    \ simultaneously. After the designated receiver decodes the identity of the\n\
    devices, it sends a transmission request and polls them sequentially, with no\
    \ idle intervals.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, relying on EH requires adaptations\
    \ that typically relate\nto the harvested energy source. For example, how to balance\
    \ the harvested energy and\nthe energy consumption can be a crucial factor in\
    \ whether or not a scheme or protocol\ncan be adopted by a network that relies\
    \ on EH, and can be the primary factor impacting\ntheir performance. Adaptation\
    \ requirements to support EH-based sensors span the whole\nnetwork stack, including\
    \ the MAC sublayer. Adaptation of receiver-initiated duty-cycle\nMAC protocol\
    \ for energy-harvesting-powered wireless sensor networks, in which besides\nthe\
    \ usual MAC challenges, both transmitter and receiver need to have sufﬁcient power\
    \ for\nsuccessful transmission, is given by Liu et al. [90].\n4.2. MAC Protocols\
    \ for Other Setups\nNext, we review some MAC protocols and MAC adaptations for\
    \ various setups,\nsuch as multi-channel, multi-radio, busy-tone utilization,\
    \ or different from the duty-cycle\napproach. DURI-MAC [91] adopts the traditional\
    \ busy-tone scheme and allocates a sub-\nchannel for control such that while receiving\
    \ data on the data channel, a busy signal\nis transmitted on the control channel,\
    \ which notiﬁes neighboring nodes of the ongoing\ntransmission, and therefore\
    \ helps avoid interference from hidden terminals. EM-MAC [92]\nutilizes multiple\
    \ orthogonal radio channels and allows devices to dynamically select the\nchannels\
    \ for their transmissions based on the channel conditions they sense without the\n\
    utilization of a control channel. Accordingly, EM-MAC can avoid using channels\
    \ that are\ncurrently heavily loaded, inferior due to interference, or jammed.\
    \ Typically, the trafﬁc\nload sent by a node is spatially and temporally variable.\
    \ Different nodes need to send\ndifferent trafﬁc loads due to their tasks, topological\
    \ location, and the amount of trafﬁc they\nneed to relay. Furthermore, the same\
    \ node can experience different loads at different time\nintervals due to events\
    \ or requests triggering different trafﬁc loads. Accordingly, several\nstudies\
    \ have explored an adaptive duty-cycle approach. For example, Ye and Zhang [93]\n\
    have developed a reinforcement-learning-based self-adaptive sleep/wake-up scheduling\n\
    approach. In the proposed method, each node (device) divides the time into time-slots,\n\
    which are not necessarily synchronized between neighboring nodes. Each node decides\n\
    whether to sleep or wake up in each time slot, and while awake, it decides whether\
    \ to listen\nor transmit. The decision is based on its current situation and its\
    \ estimation of its neighbors’\nsituations and is attained via Q-learning.\nGamm\
    \ et al. [94] devise an alternative approach to duty-cycle, which utilizes two\n\
    radios: the primary radio transceiver and an additional wake-up radio (WuR). The\
    \ wake-up\nradio is a low-power receiver triggered by an external event and can\
    \ turn on the main\ntransceiver when required. Oller et al. [95] provide a detailed\
    \ characterization of a speciﬁc\nWuR, the SubCarrier Modulation WuR (SCM-WuR),\
    \ through physical experiments and\nmeasurements, evaluating it for different\
    \ performance metrics and comparing it to other\nwake-up radio-based systems.\
    \ The authors of [95] model and simulate their own designed\nWuR hardware platform,\
    \ which is compared to four widely employed MAC protocols for\nWSN under three\
    \ real-world network deployments [96]. Spenza et al. [97] further design\nand\
    \ prototype a very-low-power-consumption (<1.3 µW), high-sensitivity (up to −55\
    \ dBm),\nfast-reactivity (wake-up time of 130 µs), and selective-addressing wake-up\
    \ receiver (WRx)\nand describe its integration to a wireless sensor node. The\
    \ authors leverage their WRx and\npresent ALBA-WUR, a cross-layer solution for\
    \ data gathering in wireless sensing systems.\nSimilar to duty-cycled MAC protocols,\
    \ wake-up radio-based protocols also distinguish\nbetween transmitter-initiated\
    \ WuR (TI-WuR) protocols in which the transmitter wakes up\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n16 of 44\nits potential receivers (e.g., [98,99]) vs. receiver-initiated\
    \ WuR (RI-WuR) that adopt the\nRI-MAC paradigm such that when a receiving node\
    \ is ready to collect data, it wakes up all\nthe nodes in its neighborhood by\
    \ broadcasting a wake-up call (e.g., [100,101]).\nAn energy-harvesting-based MAC\
    \ protocol for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is\nsuggested by Hawa et al. [102],\
    \ in which the secondary users (SUs) utilize the transmis-\nsions by primary users\
    \ (PUs) to harvest energy. Accordingly, the suggested protocol\ninterlaces SUs’\
    \ data transmissions within these PUs’ transmission holes. The proposed\nenergy-harvesting/data-transmission\
    \ schedule considers the imbalance between the small\namount of energy collected\
    \ per PU’s transmission and the energy required by an SU\ndata transmission.\n\
    Next, we mention several WSN MAC protocols that were specially designed for\n\
    particular data-gathering setups in WSN and IoT networks, exploiting the special\
    \ associ-\nated attributes (e.g., that the trafﬁc patterns are always from sensors\
    \ to the sink, or that\nthere exists a set of predeﬁned messages that need to\
    \ be sent). Cohen et al. [103] design\nand analyze a data collection protocol\
    \ based on information theoretic principles. In the\nsuggested protocol, each\
    \ sensor needs to convey one out of a bank of known messages\nto a sink. The protocol\
    \ assumes a large population of sensors and devises a scheme in\nwhich a sink\
    \ (or relay) can simultaneously collect messages from up to K sensors, without\n\
    knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchroniza-\n\
    tion, coordination, or management overhead. D-3 [104] exploits the fact that the\
    \ trafﬁc in\ndata-gathering applications ﬂows in a certain direction (toward a\
    \ single or multiple sinks)\nto devise a wake-up that can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ end-to-end delay. Speciﬁcally, D-3 lays\nout the awake schedule of communicating\
    \ nodes such that a packet can be forwarded\ntoward its destination sequentially,\
    \ without the need for a node to wait for its next-hop\nrelay to wake up (i.e.,\
    \ the wake-up schedule is such that a relay wakes up in time to receive\na packet\
    \ just received by its predecessor).\n5. Routing for Data Gathering in WSN\nWe\
    \ keep climbing the layers, and in this section we address issues related to the\n\
    Network layer. We start with a short review of WSN routing protocols. We note\
    \ that\nrouting-related aspects were also referred to in other sections of this\
    \ survey. We mainly\nfocus on the prominent and more recent protocols. We do not\
    \ provide a comprehensive\nreview of routing protocols in multihop WSNs and mainly\
    \ explore routing protocols\nsuitable for data gathering. Figure 4 provides a\
    \ schematic distribution of the discussed\npapers into main topics. As with the\
    \ schematic partition in the other sections, in order\nnot to have too many, the\
    \ topics are chosen such that the theme on each one encompasses\nseveral papers.\
    \ The papers’ partition is rough: some papers can appear in more than one\ntopic\
    \ while others are only related to the topic.\nWe start with general WSN settings\
    \ and then continue with routing protocols under\nenergy harvesting constraints.\
    \ Then we explore the utilization of network coding for data\ngathering, which\
    \ leverages the multi-hop routing, allowing relays (intermediate nodes)\nto code\
    \ the incoming packets before forwarding them toward the sink. We conclude this\n\
    section by examining a different paradigm. Rather than utilizing the traditional\
    \ approach of\nforwarding the sensed data via multiple relay nodes before reaching\
    \ the sink, this paradigm\nrelies on a Mobile Sink (MS) that traverses the network\
    \ and collects the sensed data from\nthe sensors it passes through.\n5.1. Common\
    \ WSN Routing Protocols for Data Gathering\nThe common setup for a data collection\
    \ network comprises a set of devices (e.g.,\nsensors) and one or multiple sinks\
    \ that collect the reports. In many such scenarios, the\nsensors are unevenly\
    \ dispersed over the terrain and in some cases can be mobile, can have\na different\
    \ distance to the sink(s), and the data needs to traverse multiple hops before\n\
    reaching the sink, in which commonly the sensors themselves serve as relays toward\n\
    the sink. Consequently, the performance experienced by different sensors (e.g.,\
    \ energy\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n17 of 44\nconsumption, latency, reliability)\
    \ can be markedly diverse. Various solutions, including\nenergy-aware routing,\
    \ compressed sensing, efﬁcient MAC novelties and architectural\ninnovations, have\
    \ been suggested to try to improve the overall performance and to balance\nits\
    \ variability; many are scattered throughout this survey under different subjects\
    \ (e.g.,\nSections 3, 4 and 6). In the sequel, we provide a brief review of routing\
    \ protocols for WSN\nin general and data gathering in particular.\nRouting\nSection\

    \ Cluster-Based Routing Protocols\nA signiﬁcant milestone in WSN routing protocols\
    \ is the low-energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy (LEACH) protocol [105]. The\
    \ basic LEACH protocol is an adaptive clustering-\nbased protocol that dynamically\
    \ selects sensor nodes as cluster-heads. Each cluster-head\naggregates data from\
    \ its cluster members and relays it to the sink. In order to distribute\nthe high\
    \ energy consumption imposed on cluster-heads between all the sensor nodes,\n\
    the cluster-heads are dynamically selected according to a predeﬁned probability\
    \ that\ndepends on the number of desired clusters. The resulting protocol causes\
    \ continuous\nclustering hierarchy reelection, which facilitates energy balancing.\
    \ The original version\npresented by Heinzelman et al. [105] considers a setup\
    \ in which all sensor nodes can\ndirectly communicate with the sink; hence, each\
    \ cluster-head can directly relay the collected\ninformation from its cluster\
    \ members to the sink. However, as described in the paper,\nLEACH can be easily\
    \ extended to a hierarchical cluster setup in which the cluster-head\nnodes of\
    \ each tier are also organized in clusters such that each cluster-head relays\
    \ its\naggregated data to its higher-layer cluster-head, and so on up to the top\
    \ layer of the\nhierarchy, at which point the data are sent to the sink.\nSince\
    \ its publication in 2000, numerous protocols have relied on LEACH’s clustering\n\
    paradigm, suggesting enhancements and improvements for various setups and require-\n\
    ments. For instance, EE-LEACH [106,107] aims at improving the energy efﬁciency\
    \ of\nLEACH by considering the sensor’s residual energy throughout the stages\
    \ of the proto-\ncol. Speciﬁcally, EE-LEACH assumes that node deployment is implemented\
    \ according\nto a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. It forms clusters and\
    \ selects their respective\ncluster-heads based on the residual energy of neighboring\
    \ nodes. The relay nodes that\nforward the data aggregated by cluster-heads to\
    \ the sink are selected based on their residual\nenergy. A clustering procedure\
    \ based on recursive rectangular partitioning of the network\ngrid following the\
    \ k-d tree algorithm is demonstrated by Anzola et al. [108]. The authors\nadjust\
    \ a protocol that combines their clustering methods and report that it performs\
    \ better\nthan LEACH. Several surveys have summarized the successors of the LEACH\
    \ protocol\n(e.g., [107]).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n18 of 44\nPEGASIS [109] was\
    \ designed to address the overhead resulting from the cluster\nformation in LEACH.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, PEGASIS replaces the clusters with a node-chain in which\neach\
    \ node receives the data from its predecessor and transmits it to its successor\
    \ in the chain.\nThe data is gathered while getting fused along the chain until\
    \ eventually, a designated\nnode transmits it to the sink. PEGASIS relies on nodes\
    \ having global knowledge of the\nnetwork and shows that a simple greedy algorithm\
    \ for the forwarding chain construction,\nin which nodes select their closest\
    \ neighbors as the next hops in the chain, is sufﬁcient to\nsigniﬁcantly reduce\
    \ energy consumption. Similar to LEACH, and in order to balance the\nenergy depletion\
    \ in the network, different nodes transmit the fused data to the sink on\neach\
    \ data-gathering round. P-LEACH [110] offers a hybrid between LEACH and PEGASIS\n\
    that relies on cluster formation where cluster-heads collect and forward trafﬁc.\
    \ Rather\nthan forward the trafﬁc directly to the sink, or create a hierarchical\
    \ cluster setup in which\ncluster-heads are also grouped into clusters with another\
    \ cluster-head, P-LEACH adopts\nchain-based forwarding such that the cluster-heads\
    \ are arranged in a chain along which\nthe collected data is forwarded, as suggested\
    \ by PEGASIS.\nSeveral LEACH enhancements have relied on bio-inspired algorithms.\
    \ For example,\nSiew et al. [111] utilize adaptive particle swarm optimization\
    \ (APSO). This widely used\nswarm intelligence method mimics swarming behavior\
    \ in bird ﬂocking and ﬁsh schooling\nto guide its members to search for globally\
    \ optimal solutions for cluster-head location\nselection. Tam et al. [112] extend\
    \ LEACH to a 3D setting by employing a method based on\nfuzzy clustering and particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO). Cui et al. [113] suggest a variant\nof the bat algorithm,\
    \ which simulates bat prey echolocation behavior, to optimize the\ncluster-head\
    \ selection for LEACH protocol. A routing path selection using an ant colony\n\
    optimization algorithm is presented by Jiang and Zheng [114]. Clustering by mimicking\n\
    groups of yellow goatﬁsh is discussed by Rodríguez et al. [115]. The authors claim\
    \ that\nthe presented meta-heuristic is more efﬁcient in avoiding local minima.\
    \ An extension of\nLEACH for an IoT-designated industrial environment is presented\
    \ by Karunanithy and\nVelusamy [116]. This work provides uniform CH selection,\
    \ uniform CH dispersion over\nthe industrial grid of IoT-based sensors, and tree-based\
    \ routing selection that promises to\nbe more energy efﬁcient than known counterparts.\
    \ The energy exploitation is claimed to be\nequal among nodes.\nMehmood et al.\
    \ [117] devise a dynamic-size cluster-based routing protocol for WSN\ncomprising\
    \ a large number of sensors that are spread over a large area (the paper suggests\n\
    pollution monitoring as a candidate application). The primary objective of the\
    \ presented\nscheme is to effectively select CHs to be responsible for the main\
    \ communication with BS\nand additionally deﬁned chief nodes (CNs). Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the sensor topology is divided\ninto groups, where CNs collect the updated energy\
    \ indications of other sensors within a\ngroup. There are also border nodes responsible\
    \ for communication between groups. If\ntheir energy value drops below a threshold,\
    \ the CNs can be reelected. The candidates for\nCNs and CHs are provided by an\
    \ artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which takes as inputs\nremaining energy, neighboring\
    \ node count, the amount of outstanding data, signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR), distances\
    \ between nodes, CHs, CNs and the BS, trafﬁc load, and so\non. The simulations\
    \ show a better lifetime than other selected known protocols; hence,\nthe scheme\
    \ is a better ﬁt for pollution monitoring. Clustering and routing for a wind\n\
    turbine system monitored by WSN are introduced by Durairaj and Selvaraj [118].\
    \ The\ndiscussed environment is unique because sensors placed at wind turbines\
    \ can have their\nenergy replenished by the turbine itself; hence, these sensors\
    \ are always assumed to be\ncharged. However, the distances between turbines and\
    \ the BS are too large, and the\ngrid is augmented by ground sensors that relay\
    \ the measurements. In many cases, these\nground sensors have to act as CHs. The\
    \ authors propose system partitioning and clustering\nmethods that may be hierarchical\
    \ to speciﬁcally address this scenario. An interesting\nalgorithm that also employs\
    \ partitioning, by hierarchical grouping of sensors based on\nearly knowledge\
    \ of geographical transmission patterns in mobile WSN, is presented by\nShifrin\
    \ and Cidon [119].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n19 of 44\n5.1.2. Opportunistic Routing\n\
    The opportunistic routing approach, which was designed for wireless networks,\
    \ dy-\nnamically chooses paths toward the destination on a per-transmission basis,\
    \ Biswas and\nMorris [120], Ye and Hua [121]. Opportunistic routing exploits the\
    \ broadcast nature of\nwireless communication jointly with the spatial diversity\
    \ of distributed nodes in a given\nroute such that multiple nodes overhear each\
    \ packet transmitted by a node. The node that\nreceives the packet successfully\
    \ and can serve as the best relay toward the destination (e.g.,\nclosest to the\
    \ destination) becomes the next transmitting node. Harnessing opportunistic\n\
    routing to duty-cycle MAC protocols encounters several obstacles. In synchronous\
    \ duty-\ncycle MAC protocols (Section 4), the short time duration in which all\
    \ nodes are awake (and\nspeciﬁcally, all the potential relays are awake and trying\
    \ to forward the same packet) can\nlead to artiﬁcial congestion and poor wake-time\
    \ utilization. In asynchronous duty-cycle\nMAC protocols, since not all nodes\
    \ are awake simultaneously, the use of overhearing, which\nopportunistic routing\
    \ relies on, is limited and requires adaptations such that the transmitter\nwill\
    \ transmit to multiple relays upon its wake-up (e.g., [122]) or delay its transmission,\n\
    choosing its relay opportunistically based on channel condition (e.g., [123]).\n\
    In a dense WSN, even under asynchronous duty-cycle MAC protocol, several potential\n\
    relays can be awake simultaneously, which poses additional challenges when utilizing\n\
    opportunistic routing. In addition to the relay selection problem—whether a transmitter\n\
    should wait for the best relay to wake up or compromise on a less preferable relay,\
    \ reducing\nits awake period and how long it should wait—it also encounters the\
    \ collision avoidance\nproblem between simultaneously awake nodes. Liu et al.\
    \ [124] suggest a slotted contention-\nbased scheme in which, following a probe\
    \ sent by the transmitter, the awakened potential\nrelays contend and transmit\
    \ feedback concerning the routing progress they can offer. The\ntransmitter selects\
    \ the best possible relay out of the ones that replied, taking into account\n\
    not only the metric chosen to evaluate the different relays, but also the waiting\
    \ time of\nthe link-layer transmissions. Under a similar set-up of dense asynchronous\
    \ duty-cycle\nMAC protocol with multiple potential relays awake simultaneously,\
    \ Hawbani et al. [125]\ntry to control the number of potential forwarders, which\
    \ inﬂuences both the transmitter\nwaiting time and the number of packet duplications.\
    \ The suggested solution relies on\na two-step mechanism. First, each transmitter\
    \ determines a candidate zone such that all\nnodes within the candidate zone are\
    \ potential forwarders. Second, the candidates within\nthe candidate zone are\
    \ prioritized based on a combination of metrics that considers residual\nenergy,\
    \ transmitting direction, distance, and link quality.\n5.1.3. Routing Protocol\
    \ for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)\nA routing protocol for low-power and\
    \ lossy networks (RPL) is a routing protocol\nthat was speciﬁcally designed for\
    \ networks composed of constrained nodes, which are\ninterconnected via unstable\
    \ and lossy links with relatively low packet delivery rates and\ntypically only\
    \ support low data rates (hence, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs)).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ RPL is a distance-vector proactive routing protocol designed for IPv6 low-\n\
    power devices with limited energy, processing, and memory resources (Winter et\
    \ al. [126]).\nRPL constructs a tree routing topology termed the destination-oriented\
    \ directed acyclic\ngraph (DODAG), rooted at one or more sink nodes. The routing\
    \ tree (graph), along\nwhich the trafﬁc traverses, is constructed according to\
    \ an objective function (OF) that can\nutilize a set of metrics such as energy\
    \ consumption, latency, and hop count. The most\ncommon ones are OF0, which ﬁnds\
    \ the shortest path (the path with the minimal hop-count)\nto the sink (Thubert\
    \ et al. [127]), and minimum rank with hysteresis objective function\n(MRHOF),\
    \ which ﬁnds the routes that minimize the link cost associated with the routes\n\
    (Gnawali and Levis [128]). The cost is deﬁned as the latency metric allowing RPL\
    \ to ﬁnd\nstable minimum-latency paths from each node to the sink, or it can be\
    \ associated with the\nexpected transmission count (ETX) metric, which allows\
    \ RPL to ﬁnd the stable minimum-\nETX paths from the nodes to the sink (the default\
    \ metric). In order to achieve stability,\nMRHOF also ensures that a route is\
    \ changed (a node exchanges its preferred parent in\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    20 of 44\nthe routing tree) only if the cost of the improved route is better than\
    \ the current route by\nat least a predeﬁned threshold. RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based\
    \ routing protocol for the\nIoT. Accordingly, several OFs and possible enhancements\
    \ have emerged during recent\nyears, and several performance evaluations and comparisons\
    \ have been presented. In the\nfollowing, we discuss some of these OFs.\nAbdel\
    \ Hakeem et al. [129] analyze the performance of RPL in collecting smart meter\n\
    readings over smart grid (SG) networks via Java-based simulations and IoT-LAB\
    \ testbed ex-\nperiments. Speciﬁcally, Ref. [129] evaluates the RPL performance\
    \ under the two prominent\nobjective functions Hop Count and ETX, in terms of\
    \ packet delivery ratio, network latency,\ncontrol trafﬁc overhead, and power\
    \ consumption. Barnawi et al. [130] utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to examine\
    \ the performance of RPL under duty-cycle MAC protocol.\nSpeciﬁcally, Ref. [130]\
    \ simulates RPL over the classical XMAC protocol and its derivative\nContikiMac,\
    \ where, rather than using a long preamble waiting for the receiver to wake up,\n\
    the sender repeatedly sends the same packet until a link layer acknowledgment\
    \ is received.\nAs a baseline, Ref. [130] uses NullRDC, an always-awake node.\
    \ As expected, the results\nshow that NullRDC is better in terms of latency, while\
    \ ContikiMac outperforms the others\nin terms of power consumption. Al-Shargabi\
    \ and Aleswid [131] also utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to evaluate which\
    \ OF is more suitable for a WSN in healthcare scenarios.\nOF0 and ETX are examined\
    \ in various network topologies, such as the grid and random\ntopology, under\
    \ diverse densities. They conclude that the OF0 is more efﬁcient with respect\n\
    to packet delivery ratio (PDR) and power consumption in the random topology setup.\n\
    Sousa et al. [132] propose an energy-efﬁcient and path-reliability-aware objective\n\
    function (ERAOF). The OF suggested by ERAOF linearly combines energy consumption\n\
    and link quality (in terms of ETX) routing metrics. Even though the selected routes\
    \ are\nnot optimal in either one of the objective metrics, they provide a balance\
    \ between energy\nefﬁciency and reliability. Rafea and Kadhim [133] suggest an\
    \ energy threshold RPL (ETRPL),\nwhich, in addition to the ETX metric, incorporates\
    \ in its objective function the remaining\nenergy of the preferred forwarding\
    \ (parent) node. ETRPL performance is evaluated via\nCooja simulator. Sharma et\
    \ al. [134] suggest another MRHOF-based objective function that\ntakes into account\
    \ three routing metrics: ETX, energy, and delay. Energy consumption,\nin order\
    \ to increase the lifespan of the network, is also considered by Sankar et al.\
    \ [135],\nwhich suggests cluster-tree-based routing protocol to maximize the lifetime\
    \ of IoT (CT-\nRPL). As the name suggests, CT-RPL is a cluster-based routing protocol\
    \ that involves three\nprocesses: cluster formation, cluster-head selection, and\
    \ route establishment. CT-RPL ﬁrst\nscans the nodes and group (cluster) nodes\
    \ whose Euclidean distance from their centroid\npoint is bounded, adding one node\
    \ at a time. Next, each cluster selects its cluster-head\n(CH), utilizing a game-theoretic\
    \ approach in which the node with the maximum payoff\n“p” value—which considers\
    \ parameters such as residual energy, sensing energy, receiving\nenergy, aggregation\
    \ energy, and transmission energy—is selected as the CH node for each\nround.\
    \ Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER),\
    \ queue\nutilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX).\nAnother RPL\
    \ enhancement termed weighted random forward RPL (WRF-RPL) is\nproposed by Acevedo\
    \ et al. [136]. WRF-RPL suggests a load balancing over RPL mechanism,\nwhich distributes\
    \ the trafﬁc between multiple transmission paths, trying to avoid one\npreferred\
    \ parent’s congestions. WRF-RPL OF relies on the composition of two metrics, the\n\
    remaining energy and the count of parent nodes, where the latter aims at prioritizing\
    \ parent\nnodes with more optional paths to the destination. Forwarding decisions\
    \ are probabilistic\naccording to the deﬁned metric, such that nodes with a higher\
    \ number of parents or hops\nare more likely to be selected than others. The authors\
    \ utilize the Cooja simulator for\nevaluation. Rojas et al. [137] leverage a wired\
    \ data center network labeling protocol to\nsuggest IoTorii, a routing protocol\
    \ for LLNs. IoTorii supports multiple paths between\nsender and receiver, and\
    \ requires fewer table entries and control messages, with similar\nperformance\
    \ compared to the standard RPL.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n21 of 44\nMolnár [138]\
    \ provides a graph-theoretic solution to the general problem of QoS-\nconstrained\
    \ routing in WSN that relies on RPL. The authors stress the difference between\n\
    multi-objective optimization and multi-constrained problem setting. Vera-Pérez\
    \ et al. [139]\nexamine the integration of RPL to IEEE 802.15.4e with time-slotted\
    \ channel-hopping (TSCH)\nmedium access mechanism. In particular, Ref. [139] characterizes\
    \ the long deployment\ndelays required for such networks to become operational\
    \ and able to start exchanging data\nmessages. The article proposes an analytical\
    \ model that estimates the average time that the\nsynchronization process can\
    \ take for a new node to join a TSCH-based network, as well as\nan estimation\
    \ of the maximum time required for the formation of a complete network of\nthis\
    \ kind, and the additional time required to set the RPL-based routes. The paper\
    \ validates\nthe analytical model via simulations. A recent comprehensive survey\
    \ on routing protocols\nfor LLN networks in IoT (not exclusive to RPL) can be\
    \ found in [140].\n5.2. Data Aggregation Routing Protocols for Energy Harvesting\
    \ WSN\nAs discussed in Section 2, an alternative for relying on batteries as the\
    \ source of energy,\nwith their imposed constraints (e.g., size, replacement,\
    \ etc.), is to embrace energy-harvesting\n(EH) technology. However, as mentioned\
    \ earlier, relying on EH imposes different con-\nstraints and limitations. Such\
    \ constraints can make battery-reliant schemes impractical\nwhen devising data\
    \ collection procedures. When battery-reliant schemes are applied to\nEH-based\
    \ platforms, performance can be highly degraded. Speciﬁcally, relying on EH can\n\
    induce high diversity between the different nodes, as different nodes can have\
    \ different\nattributes, such as energy depletion and charging rates, which affect\
    \ the nodes’ availability;\nin addition, different nodes can have different roles,\
    \ such as different reporting rates or\ndifferent report importance, requiring\
    \ more energy usage, which eventually also affects the\nnodes’ availability. When\
    \ a sensor is expected to transmit or receive a report, it needs to\nhave sufﬁcient\
    \ energy to complete the transaction; therefore, reliance on EH needs to be\n\
    considered when designing a scheduling protocol. For example, a data collection\
    \ scheme\nthat relies on EH should adapt the report rate to energy availability;\
    \ it can compromise\nthe rate of less important reports coming from the sensors\
    \ to leave them sufﬁcient energy\nfor emergency reports. It can prioritize sensors\
    \ with more energy over those with lower\nenergy, especially when there is some\
    \ redundancy in the reports received by different\nsensors. This is especially\
    \ so when dealing with multi-hop routing, where many of the\nnodes serve as relays\
    \ and have the burden to stay awake longer, to receive and transmit\nmore, which\
    \ escalates the heterogeneity of the nodes and accentuates the difference in\n\
    importance between the different nodes. Furthermore, if on a single-hop network,\
    \ we\ncould rely on the receiver (sink) to have unlimited power (connected to\
    \ a power source), in\nmulti-hop topologies also, the receivers rely on EH; hence,\
    \ when scheduling a transmission,\nwe need to ensure that both transmitter and\
    \ receiver have sufﬁcient power to complete the\ntransaction. In the following,\
    \ we present several routing protocol adaptations for EH-WSN\nin the context of\
    \ data aggregation.\nThe typical setup considers that each node (sensor) encompasses\
    \ an energy har-\nvester and an energy storage device and is solely powered by\
    \ the renewable energy\navailable to it by its energy storage device. A multi-hop\
    \ topology is considered such\nthat the data from many of the sensors need to\
    \ traverse multiple links before reaching the\nsink. Jeong et al. [141] propose\
    \ an adaptive data aggregation scheme for energy-harvesting\nWSNs. The suggested\
    \ scheme relies on two residual-energy thresholds, lower and upper.\nEach node\
    \ periodically estimates its residual energy level to determine whether or not\
    \ to\ntransmit data. When the node’s residual energy is either above the upper\
    \ threshold or\nbelow the lower threshold, the node transmits its aggregated data.\
    \ If its energy is below\nthe lower threshold, the node enters energy-saving mode\
    \ after transmitting the data. Its\nradio is turned off, and it waits to regain\
    \ sufﬁcient energy before turning its radio back\non. In normal operation mode,\
    \ where the residual energy is between the two thresholds,\nthe node only aggregates\
    \ data received from other nodes and collects its own sensed data.\nIf a node’s\
    \ aggregated data in normal mode exceeds its storage limit, the node transmits\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n22 of 44\nthe data regardless of its residual energy.\
    \ While this scheme is clear and straightforward\nto implement, it lacks latency\
    \ evaluation and a discussion about rendezvous between a\ntransmitter and a receiver.\n\
    Chen et al. [142] experimentally show that in energy-harvesting-based wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks (EH-WSNs), the required nodes’ charging time to be ready to\
    \ receive or send a\npacket is much greater than the time required for the contention\
    \ resolution mechanism and\ndominates the data aggregation latency. In addition\
    \ to the common collision deﬁnitions, the\npaper deﬁnes an “energy-collision”,\
    \ which occurs due to battery level constraint and not\ndue to simultaneous transmissions.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, energy-collision occurs when a transmitter-\nreceiver tuple is\
    \ scheduled for transmission, but the transmission cannot take place because\n\
    at least one of the two nodes has insufﬁcient energy to transmit or receive the\
    \ packet due\nto recent activity (insufﬁcient time has elapsed since its last\
    \ transmission or reception to\nharvest enough energy for the subsequent scheduled\
    \ transmission). An adaptable data\naggregation tree is constructed, which considers\
    \ each node’s residual and harvested energy,\nand three energy-collision-aware\
    \ data aggregation algorithms are proposed.\n5.2.1. Cluster-Based Routing Protocol\
    \ That Relies on EH\nSeveral studies have suggested various adaptations for LEACH\
    \ WSN cluster-based\nrouting protocol (e.g., [106]) for EH-based WSN (EH-WSN).\
    \ Recall that LEACH’s cluster-\nhead selection mechanism randomly selects sensor\
    \ nodes as cluster-heads to distribute\nthe energy consumption between them evenly,\
    \ which can seemingly cope with the EH\nconstraints. However, note that even when\
    \ the nodes’ platform is exactly the same, the\npotential of different nodes to\
    \ harvest energy, dependent on their speciﬁc ambient con-\nditions, can be very\
    \ different. Furthermore, the node’s location with respect to the sink\ncan highly\
    \ inﬂuence the amount of data it needs to relay toward the sink, causing high\n\
    discrepancies between the energy utilized by various nodes. To cope with these\
    \ discrepan-\ncies, Xiao et al. [143] modify LEACH’s cluster-head selection mechanism\
    \ and deﬁne a new\nmetric termed “energy potential function” to measure each node’s\
    \ capability to harvest\nenergy. The paper devises a cluster-head selection strategy\
    \ that prioritizes nodes with\nhigher expected stored energy (based on the currently\
    \ available energy and their potential\nenergy) to become cluster-heads, regardless\
    \ of the number of instances that the node was\nselected as cluster-head in the\
    \ past.\nTo address the imbalance between the energy expected to be consumed by\
    \ cluster-\nheads (CHs) that are closer to the sink and are expected to spend\
    \ more energy on relaying\npackets from farther clusters, and CHs that are further\
    \ from the sink and expected to relay\nless trafﬁc, Wu et al. [144] suggest an\
    \ unbalanced clustering mechanism. In particular,\ncluster sizes are determined\
    \ according to the distance (hop count) to the sink to balance the\nenergy consumption\
    \ of the CHs. Accordingly, clusters closer to the sink, which are expected\nto\
    \ relay more inter-cluster trafﬁc, will be smaller, so that they collect less\
    \ intra-cluster\ntrafﬁc; clusters further away from the sink and expected to relay\
    \ less inter-cluster trafﬁc\nwill comprise more nodes, so that they collect more\
    \ intra-cluster trafﬁc. The mechanism\nsuggested to attain this balance is partitioning\
    \ the network conceptually into concentric\nrings around the sink with linearly\
    \ increasing radii. Each ring comprises nodes with\nthe same hop distance to the\
    \ sink. Clusters within the same ring will have the same\nsize. CH selection is\
    \ designed to balance the loads of each ring considering the available\nnodes’\
    \ energy, which is evaluated based on the EH rate. Following a similar approach,\n\
    Yang et al. [145] assume a highly symmetric circular sensor network in which the\
    \ sink\n(BS) is located at the center, and the sensors are distributed evenly\
    \ in a disc around it.\nAs with [144], the sensor ﬁeld is divided into concentric\
    \ rings; however, in this study,\nthe rings are determined to have an equal area\
    \ such that the number of sensors in each\nring is expected to be the same. Under\
    \ the given model, Ref. [145] analyzes the energy\nconsumption of intra- and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmission and derives the energy neutrality\nconstraints, which guarantee\
    \ that each node consumes less energy than the amount of\nenergy it has harvested.\
    \ The authors further devise a constraint formula of the number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n23 of 44\nclusters required in each layer (ring) that balances the\
    \ average energy consumption of nodes\nin different layers. The energy neutrality\
    \ constraints and the cluster parameters are used to\nobtain the parameters (number\
    \ of rings, number of clusters in each ring, and minimum\nnetwork data transmission\
    \ cycle) that minimize the data transmission cycle. Based on the\nattained parameters,\
    \ the cluster-based routing protocol is derived. The protocol consists\nof an\
    \ initialization phase and repeated cycles divided into topology formation and\
    \ data-\ngathering phases. Bahbahani and Alsusa [146] suggest two separate enhancements.\
    \ The\nﬁrst, termed cooperative transmission strategy, enables nodes to serve\
    \ as relays to relay\nundelivered packets from cluster members to CHs and from\
    \ CHs to the sink node. The\nsecond mechanism, termed cluster-head duty-cycle,\
    \ regulates the frequency at which a node\ncan become a CH based on duty-cycling\
    \ that adapts to the node’s energy-harvesting rate.\nTo conserve the energy of\
    \ nodes that are more susceptible to energy depletion,\nBozorgi et al. [147] select\
    \ CHs, taking into account their residual energy, expected har-\nvest energy,\
    \ distance from the sink, number of neighbors, and, similar to LEACH, the\nnumber\
    \ of times a node has already served as a CH in the past. The proposed approach,\n\
    which combines centralized and distributed mechanisms, relies on a signal transmitted\n\
    by the sink that can be received by all the nodes, which allows them to estimate\
    \ their\ngeographic distance from the sink. The network is partitioned by the\
    \ sink into four layers\nbased on distance. The sink further computes the individual\
    \ coverage radius of each node\n(potential CH) based on distance (nodes closer\
    \ to the sink, which are therefore expected\nto relay trafﬁc coming from more\
    \ distant clusters, will have a smaller radius, and thus\nless intra-cluster trafﬁc;\
    \ on the other hand, nodes farther away from the sink, which are\ntherefore expected\
    \ to have less inter-cluster trafﬁc to relay, are assigned a longer radius,\n\
    and therefore more intra-cluster trafﬁc). The paper suggests a distributed contention-based\n\
    mechanism for selecting the CHs in which the contention window takes into account\
    \ the\nparameters mentioned above. Another cluster-based routing for EH-WSN is\
    \ proposed by\nRen and Yao [148]. The proposed routing scheme is divided into\
    \ cluster establishment and\ndata collection. It is suggested that besides the\
    \ typical cluster members (CMs) and cluster-\nhead (CH), a new entity be devised,\
    \ termed in the paper scheduling node (SN), which is\ndifferent from the CH. The\
    \ main task of the SN is to monitor the energy of all the cluster\nmembers during\
    \ the data collection stage and select a CH based on the monitored residual\n\
    energy of the cluster members. The transmission range of nodes can also be adjusted\
    \ based\non their residual energy. The data collection stage, which adapts a round-based\
    \ scheme\nsimilar to LEACH, is divided into the data transmission and CH selection\
    \ stages.\nSinde et al. [149] aim to improve the network efﬁciency by three means:\
    \ (i) clusteriza-\ntion mechanism that takes into account energy consumption during\
    \ the data aggregation\nphase, (ii) duty cycle adaptation of each node such that\
    \ each sensor node determines its\nmode of operation, and (iii) routing mechanism\
    \ based on ant colony optimization that\nchooses the path between the source and\
    \ the sink node that reduces the delay incurred.\nOverall, while the paper jointly\
    \ addresses several topics in WSN, including those connected\nto energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data gathering, its main contribution is the detailed NS3 simulation.\n5.2.2.\
    \ Mobile Charger\nToday’s technology enables dedicated wireless charging equipment\
    \ (WCE) to recharge\nthe nodes’ batteries, prolonging the lifetime of wireless\
    \ rechargeable sensor networks.\nA model in which, in addition to the sink (base\
    \ station), a mobile station will navigate\nthrough the WSN to collect data and\
    \ charge sensor nodes is considered by Liu et al. [150].\nThe paper suggests a\
    \ joint routing and charging strategy. The joint problem is decomposed\ninto two\
    \ sub-optimization problems: routing tree optimization and charging path optimiza-\n\
    tion. Heuristic algorithms based on simulated annealing algorithms were applied\
    \ to solve\nthese sub-optimization problems.\nA joint charging and routing algorithm\
    \ with WCE-assisted data gathering is also\nsuggested by Lu et al. [151]. The\
    \ model suggested therein assumes that the BS (sink) can\nget the information\
    \ of each node at any time, including node location, residual energy,\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n24 of 44\nand energy consumption rate. The suggested approach\
    \ relates to data routing and energy\nsupplement to undercharged nodes. The data\
    \ routing algorithm considers several factors:\nsensor buffer occupancy, load,\
    \ and energy. To ﬁnd the route for the mobile recharging\nunit to traverse, they\
    \ rely on Du [152] to seek the shortest Hamiltonian cycle between the\nnodes that\
    \ urgently need energy replenishment traversed by the mobile recharging unit.\n\
    Additional nodes along the traversed path can also be charged. Furthermore, the\
    \ mobile\nrecharging unit can also gather data from sensors with a critical buffer\
    \ occupancy during\nits recharging cycle.\nIn the following section, we discuss\
    \ network coding (NC) and, in particular, linear\nnetwork coding in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\n5.3. Network Coding (NC)\nNetwork coding leverages\
    \ the routing protocols and the ability to construct multi-path\nrouting between\
    \ sources and their destination (the sink) to enable intermediate nodes to\nperform\
    \ coding on the incoming packets before forwarding them. In the following section,\n\
    we discuss network-coding-related works.\nLinear network coding was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ by Celebiler and Stette [153] and evolved in\nthe seminal paper by Ahlswede\
    \ et al. [154] as a means to improve the network’s throughput,\nefﬁciency, and\
    \ scalability, which can also be leveraged to improve the network resilience\n\
    to attacks and eavesdropping. Linear network coding allows the network’s intermediate\n\
    nodes (e.g., relays) to accumulate arriving messages and forward a newly encoded\
    \ message,\nwhich is a linear combination of the accumulated packets, multiplying\
    \ them by coefﬁcients\nchosen from a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The manner in which nodes encode\
    \ and decode messages de-\npends on the selected coding scheme. Network coding\
    \ (NC) over wireless communication\ncan reduce the number of transmissions by\
    \ leveraging the fact that a single transmission is\noverheard by multiple nodes\
    \ in the transmitter’s vicinity, and can therefore be utilized by\neach of these\
    \ nodes, which will forward a coded packet with unique coefﬁcients comprising\n\
    its own message and the messages it overheard (e.g., [155]).\nIn WSNs, NC can\
    \ be utilized for various trafﬁc patterns, including data dissemination\n(one-to-many\
    \ communication) and data gathering. Works on energy-efﬁcient NC-based\ndissemination\
    \ can be followed in the survey [156], with multi-hop routing being empha-\nsized.\
    \ In data dissemination in which the base station/sink distributes information\
    \ to\nthe sensor nodes, NC is beneﬁcial mainly for distributing control messages\
    \ (broadcast or\nmulticast trafﬁc) or, in case of unicast trafﬁc, for recovering\
    \ lost packets (retransmissions).\nThe latter utilization relies on the fact that\
    \ different nodes heard or did not hear different\npackets. Accordingly, nodes\
    \ store packets they overheard, even if not destined to them-\nselves. The transmitter\
    \ (e.g., access-point) accumulates several packets that need to be\nretransmitted,\
    \ each for a different receiver. It transmits a coded packet that is a composite\n\
    of these accumulated packets. Each receiver can decode a missing packet by utilizing\
    \ its\nstored overheard packets (e.g., [157–162], where the last two mainly focus\
    \ on data dis-\nsemination of control management messages. It is noteworthy that\
    \ Cohen et al. [157] also\npresent a successful real HW radio deployment of their\
    \ scheme. XOR-CoW [163] exploits\nthe same concept to design an IoT protocol in\
    \ which relays transmit coded packets that\nmix downlink and uplink trafﬁc. Similar\
    \ to other previously mentioned studies, the coding\nscheme by Swamy et al. [163]\
    \ is over ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld of size 2 (GF(2)) (i.e., XORing the\ncoded packets).\n\
    Network coding is widely explored for data-gathering schemes. Typically, an NC-\n\
    based protocol involves both the coding scheme and the multi-path routing. It\
    \ relies on\nthe relay nodes to overhear packets and perform the coding, and on\
    \ the sink (or multiple\nsinks) to collect sufﬁcient coded packets (combinations)\
    \ to encode the sent information.\nThe limited ability of the sensors constrains\
    \ NC over WSN (e.g., limited storage to store\noverheard packets, limited computation\
    \ power to perform sophisticated operations, limited\nawake time for packet overhearing,\
    \ etc.). The utilized coding scheme inﬂuences the\nperformance of the NC algorithm\
    \ in several aspects such as the throughput, algorithm\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    25 of 44\ncomplexity, encoding complexity, decoding complexity, packet overhead\
    \ (bits), required\nfeedback, and so on. Note that many of these metrics are directly\
    \ translated to air time\nand energy consumption, which must be considered in\
    \ WSN. The random linear network\ncoding (RLNC) encoding scheme (e.g., [164])\
    \ is widely used because, despite its simplicity,\nit can attain throughput that\
    \ is close to the optimal one using a decentralized algorithm.\nIn RLNC, relays\
    \ transmit random linear combinations of the packets they receive, with\nrandomly\
    \ chosen coefﬁcients from a ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld (GF). The receiver must obtain a\n\
    sufﬁcient number of linearly independent combinations (packets) to decode the\
    \ original\npackets. If the GF size is sufﬁciently large, the probability that\
    \ the randomly generated\ncombinations will be linearly independent is high. However,\
    \ the receiver needs to know the\ncoefﬁcient used in each combination; hence,\
    \ it needs to be sent as overhead piggybacked on\neach traversed packet. The larger\
    \ the GF size, the higher the overhead. RLNC scheme with\ndistributed encoding\
    \ was utilized by Stefanovi´c et al. [165] for a perimeter data-gathering\nobjective,\
    \ in which the data should reach the perimeter nodes that are located on the\n\
    boundary of the covered area. The proposed scheme does not deploy routing algorithms\
    \ or\nmaintain routing information and relies on random walks.\nOne disadvantage\
    \ of RLNC is its decoding complexity in the order of O(n3), where n\ndenotes the\
    \ number of original packets. Sparse end-to-end erasure-correcting codes can\n\
    reduce the decoding load on the receiver at the cost of introducing an additional,\
    \ non-\nnegligible delay. Feizi et al. [166] suggest a tunable sparse network\
    \ coding (TSNC) scheme\nthat tunes the level of sparsity as the transmission process\
    \ evolves. This tuning process\ncan reduce the delay overhead by using denser\
    \ codes towards the end of the transmission\nwhile maintaining the complexity\
    \ advantages of a sparse code. Prior et al. [167] propose\ntwo network coding\
    \ schemes for information gathering, which are based on tunable sparse\ncodes,\
    \ with and without explicit feedback from the sink. The suggested schemes are\n\
    designed for meter readings in a smart grid. Nistor et al. [168] further exploit\
    \ RLNC and\nTSNC for data gathering and derived analytical bounds for a multi-hop\
    \ line network using\na ﬂuid model, which is valid for any ﬁeld size and various\
    \ sparsity levels, and has two\ndifferent feedback mechanisms.\nSenseCode [169]\
    \ adopts the NC paradigm, aspiring to balance energy efﬁciency and\nend-to-end\
    \ packet error rate. SenseCode relies on nodes transmitting both uncoded and\n\
    coded packets. Each node stores only a small portion of the packets it overhears,\
    \ which can\nbe attained by letting the node wake up sporadically within its duty\
    \ cycle and stay awake\nfor a short time interval each time it wakes up, storing\
    \ overheard packets. Accordingly,\neach coded packet comprises only a small subset\
    \ of the packets the node could have\npotentially overheard and coded. NetCoDer\
    \ [170] concentrates on a star topology in\nwhich the star-head can be a sink\
    \ or a relay that collects information from its neighbors.\nNetCoDer opportunistically\
    \ selects, based on network conditions, a set of relays that, in\naddition to\
    \ the data sent by the nodes, send additional coded packets with packets they\n\
    overheard, which helps the star-head recover lost packets. To reduce the overhead,\
    \ the\nrelays use LNC coefﬁcients based on the addresses of the sensor nodes.\
    \ A similar idea\nthat also does not rely on feedback was presented in SR-Code\
    \ [171] in which nodes and\nrelays send redundant coded messages to help the sink\
    \ recover lost messages. SR-Code\nutilizes the XOR operator (GF(2)). Similar to\
    \ NetCoDer, SR-Code reduces the overhead\nby using a bitmap to identify the coded\
    \ packets rather than the address of the sending\nnode. Al-Hawri et al. [172]\
    \ assume a data-gathering setup with single or multiple gateways\n(sinks) that\
    \ can collaborate (exchange information via accessible shared distributed storage\n\
    system). The paper distinguishes between traditional relays, which forward packets\
    \ they\nreceive as-is, and encoding relays, which perform network-coding on the\
    \ packets they\nreceive before forwarding them. The authors suggest a mathematical\
    \ model and a heuristic\nalgorithm to determine the number of network-encoding\
    \ nodes and their location, which\nis insufﬁcient for the aggregate received data\
    \ at the gateway/gateways to be decodable,\ntaking into account link failure scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n26 of 44\nProtocols that utilize NC in WSN need to balance\
    \ achieving the NC expedience and\ndiverse performance criteria. On the one hand,\
    \ the motivation is to send only coded packets,\nas sending uncoded packets degrades\
    \ the NC gain. On the other hand, a strategy in which\na relay waits for packets\
    \ to arrive in order to code them can yield unacceptable delays.\nFurthermore,\
    \ storing arriving packets while waiting for additional packets to arrive before\n\
    coding them can result in a buffer overﬂow and packet loss. To overcome these\
    \ drawbacks,\nChen et al. [173] suggest an opportunistic network coding (ONC)\
    \ approach in which the\nrelay can transmit either coded or uncoded packets. Each\
    \ relay determines whether to\ntransmit a coded or uncoded packet according to\
    \ its queue state at each transmission\nopportunity. For the simple topology of\
    \ a relay interconnecting two nodes that communi-\ncate with one another, Ref.\
    \ [173] presents an ONC strategy that can achieve the optimal\ndelay/power tradeoff.\
    \ Mirani et al. [174] adopt the ONC paradigm for data dissemination\nin vehicular\
    \ ad hoc networks (VANETs), for which the mobile nodes (vehicles) employ a\ndecode-and-forward\
    \ scheme with subjective timers determined according to their distance\nfrom the\
    \ source. In Tan et al. [175], an opportunistic routing protocol with opportunistic\n\
    network coding is proposed for correlated data gathering.\nNext, we provide more\
    \ recent works that utilize NC in WSNs and related networks\nthat are not particular\
    \ to data-gathering applications. Marques et al. [176] propose to use\nNC in a\
    \ fog computing scenario, since in the fog computing system architecture, the\
    \ data\nmeasured on a node should be delivered to many other destination nodes.\
    \ The authors\ndesign a protocol for encoding and decoding and provide a design\
    \ to incorporate it on\nthe MAC level. Uwitonze et al. [177] consider a setup\
    \ in which a WSN has been split into\nmultiple disjoint partitions and suggests\
    \ a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on\nspace network coding termed\
    \ relay placement using space network coding (i.e., rather than\nsend additional\
    \ coded data, additional relay nodes are deployed) for ﬁnding the optimal\nnumber\
    \ and positions to place relay nodes for restoring the network connectivity.\n\
    A network coding backpressure routing scheme for data aggregation in large-scale\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) networks is explored by Malathy et al. [178]. The proposed\
    \ routing\nscheme exploits network coding for the data aggregation process, which\
    \ improves the\nthroughput of the network by eliminating redundant packets. The\
    \ paper relies on cluster-\nbased routing that selects the cluster-heads (CH)\
    \ based on the available energy and distance,\nwhich helps to minimize trafﬁc\
    \ congestion and provide efﬁcient data transmission.\n5.4. Data Collection Utilizing\
    \ Mobile Sink and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nA different paradigm for the\
    \ traditional setup of data gathering in WSN, which\nrelies on a single or multiple\
    \ static sink(s) towards which all trafﬁc needs to travel, is\nthe utilization\
    \ of one or multiple mobile sinks (MSs) that traverse the terrain and collect\n\
    the reports from the devices. Such mobile sink(s) can be the trafﬁc’s ﬁnal destination\
    \ or\njust an accessory that collects the data and transmits it to the sink. Note\
    \ that in the latter\ncase, the ﬁnal destination is not necessarily located within\
    \ the wireless network realm\nand can be located outside it (e.g., within the\
    \ Internet or the cloud). Since these mobile\nsinks are unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ in many cases, these systems are sometimes called\nunmanned aerial vehicle-wireless\
    \ sensor networks (UAV–WSNs). This section reviews\nseveral state-of-the-art developments\
    \ in mobile sink(s). Since sometimes the MS routing\nchallenges are interleaved\
    \ with the MAC layer’s challenges, the solution suggested in some\npapers, and\
    \ accordingly their description, incorporated both layers.\nTypically, data-gathering\
    \ protocols that utilize moving sink(s) aim at optimizing some\nperformance metrics,\
    \ such as overall power consumption, average or worst latency of the\ndata, trajectory\
    \ traversed by the mobile sink, awake time of the sensors, maximizing the\nlife\
    \ cycle of the network, and so on. There are different options to classify these\
    \ protocols:\nthey can be classiﬁed according to this aforementioned performance\
    \ objective, or other\ncategories, such as characteristics of the moving sink,\
    \ its speed and constraints, network\nmodel, communication standard utilized,\
    \ and so on. In this section, we will classify the\nprotocol into two classes:\
    \ protocols that solely rely on the moving sink with no intra-trafﬁc\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n27 of 44\nbetween the nodes (all the trafﬁc is directly transmitted\
    \ to the moving sink), and protocols\nthat combine routing between the nodes and\
    \ trafﬁc forwarding to the sink. This latter\nclass will mostly include cluster-based\
    \ protocols in which the nodes are clustered and\ncluster-heads (CHs) are selected,\
    \ but rather than the CHs routing the trafﬁc towards the\nsink, they forward the\
    \ trafﬁc directly to the mobile sink.\n5.4.1. Routing Directly to the Mobile Sink(s)\
    \ with No Intra-Node Data Forwarding\nIn this section, we review papers in which\
    \ the only data trafﬁc is between the nodes\nand the mobile sink, and no data\
    \ is forwarded between the nodes.\nZhan et al. [179] consider a general fading\
    \ channel model and suggest an efﬁcient\nsub-optimal solution that minimizes the\
    \ energy consumption of all sensor nodes (SNs)\nwhile ensuring that data is collected\
    \ reliably from all SNs with bounded outage probability.\nThe suggested solution\
    \ decouples the joint optimization problem, which considers both\nthe SNs’ wake-up\
    \ schedule and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV’s) trajectory, into two\nseparate\
    \ optimization problems, ensuring that the amount of data collected from each\
    \ SN\nreliably exceeds a threshold. One of the formulated optimization problems\
    \ is non-convex\ndue to non-convex constraints, and therefore it needs to be relaxed.\
    \ The two problems are\nsolved iteratively to obtain an approximate solution.\
    \ A ﬂight time minimization problem\nfor a UAV that collects data from a set of\
    \ energy-constrained ground sensors is studied by\nGong et al. [180]. The sensors\
    \ are assumed to be located on a line (one dimension). Each\nsensor has a certain\
    \ amount of data to upload. The UAV can collect data either while\nﬂying or while\
    \ hovering, and only from a single sensor at a time. Accordingly, the UAV’s\n\
    trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, each dedicated\
    \ to\ncollecting data from a single sensor. The objective is to minimize the total\
    \ ﬂight time of the\nUAV from an initial point to a destination by jointly optimizing\
    \ the division of intervals, the\nUAV’s speed, as well as the sensors’ transmission\
    \ power. The ﬂight time minimization is\nformulated as a dynamic programming (DP)\
    \ problem, where each DP stage considers ﬂight\ntime minimization for a single-sensor\
    \ data collection scenario. The algorithm for the single-\nsensor case is used\
    \ to ﬁnd the UAV’s optimal speed and the sensor’s transmission power.\nIt is shown\
    \ that the UAV’s optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors\n\
    and the inter-sensor distance but is inversely proportional to the data upload\
    \ requirements.\nThe metric addressed by Liu et al. [181] is the age of the information.\
    \ In particular,\nRef. [181] utilizes UAV, and suggests two age-optimal trajectories\
    \ for it to collect the\ndata from the ground SNs, one that minimizes the age\
    \ of the ‘oldest’ sensed information\namong the sensors, and another that minimizes\
    \ the average age of the information sensed\nby all sensors. It is shown that\
    \ both age-optimal trajectories correspond to the shortest\nHamiltonian path in\
    \ the wireless sensor network, in which the distance between any\ntwo sensors\
    \ is represented by the amount of inter-visit time. The authors adopt dynamic\n\
    programming and genetic algorithm to ﬁnd the two different age-optimal trajectories.\n\
    Liu et al. [182] also utilize a UAV to collect the data from the ground sensors.\
    \ The model\nsuggested therein assumes that the sensors (nodes) are randomly distributed\
    \ over a square\narea. The area is partitioned into small square cells. The UAV\
    \ ﬂying above the cells\nhovers above each cell to collect all the data of the\
    \ sensors within the cell. The paper\nstudies the amount of data per unit time\
    \ that the UAV can collect from the ground nodes\nas a function of the number\
    \ of cells, the height of the UAV, the number of sensors, and\nthe energy capacity\
    \ of the UAV. The paper suggests a similar analysis when multiple\nUAVs are utilized.\
    \ It seeks the optimal number of cells to maximize the per-node capacity\nunder\
    \ the suggested model and shows that under the suggested data collection network,\n\
    multiple UAVs can signiﬁcantly improve the per-node capacity attained by a single\
    \ UAV.\nThe balanced network communication protocol (BNCP) that utilizes UAV as\
    \ a mobile\nsink is suggested by Qin et al. [183]. There is no inter-sensor routing\
    \ in BNCP, and all\nsensors’ communication energy is spent on the sensor-UAV transmission\
    \ links. BNCP is\nimplemented and evaluated.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n28 of 44\n\
    5.4.2. Cluster-Based Data Forwarding\nRather than the mobile sink node traversing\
    \ the network between all the sensors, a\ndifferent approach groups the sensors\
    \ into clusters and selects cluster-heads (CH), which\ncollect the data from all\
    \ cluster members, thus decreasing the traverse of the mobile sink.\nIn general,\
    \ data gathering in a clustered WSN imposes a tradeoff between the energy\nconsumed\
    \ during data collection within each cluster and the energy consumed by the\n\
    mobile sink. On the one hand, the higher the number of clusters (smaller clusters),\
    \ the\nless energy is consumed during data collection by the cluster-heads (CH);\
    \ on the other\nhand, it follows that the UAV will have to access more CHs on\
    \ its route, and consequently,\nthe energy spent by the UAV will be higher in\
    \ that case. This trade-off is one of the main\nchallenges in addressing the joint\
    \ problem of clusterization and CH selection, jointly with\nﬁnding the path traversed\
    \ by the UAV, as reﬂected in several papers discussed below.\nNajjar-Ghabel et\
    \ al. [184] propose a two-phase algorithm, termed DGOB, for data\ngathering in\
    \ WSNs in an environment impaired by obstacles, which utilizes a mobile sink\n\
    that traverses the network and collects the data. Both phases, node clusterization\
    \ and\nMS trajectory construction, exploit artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) schemes.\
    \ Tazibt et al. [185]\nutilize a small-scale drone to gather the data from scattered\
    \ sensors. Like in several other\npapers that rely on UAV to collect data from\
    \ cluster-heads, the challenge in [185] is two-fold:\n(i) clusterization and CH\
    \ selection (in contrast with other papers, this paper allows multi-\nhop clusters,\
    \ such that cluster members are up to a predeﬁned number of hops from their\n\
    CH); and (ii) plan of the drone trajectory for traversing through all CHs with\
    \ minimum\nenergy consumption (e.g., minimum path length). Even though the two\
    \ problems are\nrelated, the authors solve the two issues sequentially. They ﬁrst\
    \ solve the CH selection\nby formulating an optimization problem that seeks the\
    \ minimal set of cluster-heads that\nguarantee that all nodes are at most h hops\
    \ from a CH in the set. After determining the CH\nset via linear programing, they\
    \ utilize the 2-opt heuristic, which relies on a simple local\nsearch algorithm\
    \ for solving the traveling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the optimal\ntravel\
    \ trajectory for the drone between the selected CHs.\nKumar and Dash [186] also\
    \ suggest a data-gathering-by-mobile-sink scheme in WSN.\nThe model in [186] assumes\
    \ that the mobile sink is moving along a pre-speciﬁed path with\nconstant speed\
    \ and can collect data while traveling. The paper denotes all the sensors\nthat\
    \ are in transmission range from the mobile-sink traversed path, and can therefore\n\
    relay trafﬁc to it, as sub-sinks. All other nodes need to forward their data to\
    \ these sub-\nsinks, possibly through multi-hop communication, in order for them\
    \ to relay the data\nto the mobile sink. The paper suggests two different models:\
    \ the ﬁrst assumes that the\nmobile sink can receive data from only one sensor\
    \ at a time, while the second assumes that\nthe mobile sink can receive data from\
    \ multiple sensors simultaneously. Both suggested\nalgorithms comprise three phases:\
    \ (i) identify the relay nodes (sub-sinks) that are within\ntransmission range\
    \ from the mobile sink trajectory (unit disk graph model), and partition\nthe\
    \ path into segments that are the union of all the transmission disks of all the\
    \ sub-sinks;\n(ii) determine the communication time each sub-sink can have with\
    \ the mobile sink, and\naccordingly, the amount of data it can transmit; (iii)\
    \ utilize a network ﬂow approach to\ndetermine which sub-sink transmits to the\
    \ mobile sink in each of the mobile sink’s path\nsegments. Ebrahimi et al. [187]\
    \ aim to optimize total transmission power between WSN\ncluster-heads in an IoT\
    \ network. The problem is split into subproblems, which include\nCH assignment,\
    \ building of the forwarding tree within each cluster, and optimal UAV\ntrajectory\
    \ calculation. The data transmitted by CH to UAV is pre-processed by a specialized\n\
    optimized compression. A genetic algorithm for energy-efﬁcient CH selection is\
    \ employed\nby Wu et al. [188].\nThe focus of Zahra et al. [189] is on MS that\
    \ traverses a WSN that relies on a cluster-\nbased data collection protocol in\
    \ which cluster-heads are responsible for collecting and\ntransmitting the cluster\
    \ members’ sensed data to the MS. The paper examines a scenario in\nwhich the\
    \ MS is constantly moving in a predeﬁned trajectory, regardless of whether the\n\
    data transfer was completed or not. Accordingly, when the cluster aggregate data\
    \ is too\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n29 of 44\nlarge, the CH cannot complete the\
    \ transaction. The authors suggest a mechanism in which,\nin case the CH cannot\
    \ complete the transaction, it can use different cluster members as\nrelays to\
    \ continue the transaction after the MS has moved out of the transmission range\n\
    of the CH. Likewise, Zhang et al. [190] also suggest a hybrid approach that combines\
    \ the\nMS with hierarchical routing-based protocol relying on node clusterization.\
    \ In order to\nimprove the efﬁciency of the MS data collection, Ref. [190] suggests\
    \ utilizing virtual heads\n(VHs) that lie on the MS trajectory on the cluster\
    \ boundaries that also transmit collected\ndata to the MS. The channel access\
    \ relies on a random access mechanism.\nThe UAV can be of different physical structures.\
    \ While some machines are able to slow\ndown and even to hover, others, especially\
    \ the winged UAVs, can only ﬂy with a constant\nvelocity. This limitation poses\
    \ an additional challenge; see Say et al. [191] for a possible\nsolution. To address\
    \ the velocity limitation, the grid topology of the UAV’s coverage is\ndivided\
    \ into frames, and the most distant frames get the highest priority. The priority-based\n\
    transmissions from sensors to the moving UAV are incorporated into a MAC layer,\
    \ by\nintroducing a priority-based contention window adjustment scheme. A smaller\
    \ contention\nwindow is assigned to the frame where sensors send packets from\
    \ the rear side of the UAV,\nand should therefore have a higher transmission priority.\
    \ This results in a low packet loss\nwhen the UAV ﬂies forward. On top of this\
    \ architecture, a frame-selection-based routing\nprotocol is formulated.\n6. Wearables\
    \ and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN)\nNumerous applications rely on data gathering\
    \ and report collection in WSN and IoT,\nand some are mentioned throughout the\
    \ paper. There is no doubt that the essence of WSN\nis the applications that utilize\
    \ the infrastructure discussed throughout this paper. Providing\na thorough review\
    \ of such applications can encompass several surveys. Since wearables\nare becoming\
    \ highly popular and a ubiquitous application which imposes new challenges\nin\
    \ the context of data gathering, we discuss several recent results and related\
    \ challenges in\nthe context of wearables. Figure 5 depicts the main topics discussed\
    \ in this section.\nWearables and WBAN\nSection 6\nEnergy Harvesting (EH)\nSection\
    \ 6.1\nTechnological Advances\nSection 6.2\nTransmission Protocols\nSection 6.3\n\
    WBAN Applications\nSection 6.4\nFigure 5. The main topics in the context of wearables\
    \ covered in the section, and a rough partition of\nthe papers covered by these\
    \ topics.\nWearable technology refers to smart devices attached to the human body\
    \ or apparel\nto monitor the user and their environment. Wearables are designed\
    \ to detect, analyze,\nand transmit information, which allows continuous monitoring\
    \ of the subject. In some\ncases (e.g., healthcare applications), feedback is\
    \ returned to the wearer with strict perfor-\nmance constraints (e.g., reliability,\
    \ latency bounds). Such applications can necessitate the\nmonitoring of both bodily\
    \ conditions, such as blood pressure, blood glucose level (e.g.,\nin conjunction\
    \ with an insulin pump), ECG, EMG, body temperature, accelerometer, and\ngyroscope,\
    \ as well as environmental conditions that might inﬂuence the user, such as\n\
    temperature, humidity, CO2 level, dust level, and location.\nSensing essential\
    \ human physiological parameters led to the innovation of wireless\nbody area\
    \ networks (WBANs). WBAN typically relates to a small area network that spans\n\
    the whole human body. It comprises devices (wearables) located in the apparel,\
    \ on the\nbody, or under the skin, and are wirelessly connected. Even though tracking\
    \ physical\nconditions applies to diverse domains, including medical, social,\
    \ and economic ones, each\nwith its particular implications and extensive research\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the speciﬁc challenges\nof acquiring data in WBANs necessitated\
    \ new solutions designed for WBAN. Speciﬁcally,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n30 of\
    \ 44\nsince the sensors in WBANS are designed to be located close to the monitored\
    \ individual,\nthey impose particular challenges related to their speciﬁc structural,\
    \ functional, and size-\nrelated constraints. In the sequel, we dwell on some\
    \ of the most critical challenges and\nrecent promising results on WBANS. The\
    \ main objective of this survey is to understand the\ndata-gathering challenges.\
    \ In the special case of WBANS, we also elaborate on the sensors’\nphysical and\
    \ mechanical structure, which directly impact the data acquisition process.\n\
    Many of the challenges pertaining to WSN in general, which are described throughout\n\
    this survey, also apply to wearables. However, some of these challenges are exaggerated\n\
    when applied to wearables due to their unique characteristics. For example, energy-related\n\
    challenges that are essential to address and substantially inﬂuence any WSN design\
    \ and\nperformance, open a different perspective on wearables. Speciﬁcally, due\
    \ to their sensing\ndevices’ tiny size, the energy storing capacities are limited.\
    \ Yet, many wearable applications,\nparticularly healthcare ones, employ continuous\
    \ sampling and communication tasks that\nconstantly consume energy and deplete\
    \ the device’s battery. Frequent battery replacement,\nwhich can be a burden in\
    \ any WSN, can be even more cumbersome in wearables and can\nhinder the adoption\
    \ of these technologies (e.g., when the wearables are implants, battery\nreplacement\
    \ can involve an invasive medical intervention). Accordingly, energy-efﬁcient\n\
    approaches designed for wearable sensor networks are important for disseminating\
    \ the\ntechnology into additional domains. An inclusive review of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ approaches\ndesigned for human context recognition (HCR) based on wearable sensor\
    \ networks is\ngiven by [192]. This paper classiﬁes energy-efﬁcient mechanisms\
    \ for health-related HCR\napplications, based on the task that the mechanism is\
    \ aimed at to reduce its energy con-\nsumption (e.g., sensing, communication,\
    \ computation). The paper reviews the related\nworks according to the classiﬁcation.\n\
    6.1. Energy Harvesting (EH)\nEnergy harvesting as a battery alternative has been\
    \ discussed in Section 5.2. However,\nEH in the context of wearables encounters\
    \ new challenges, such as critical reliability level,\nexpected tiny size and\
    \ position in/on the human body, limited exposure to energy sources\nsuch as solar\
    \ energy, and so on. Accordingly, we revisit EH and review some EH studies\nin\
    \ the context of wearables. The three most prominent techniques include photovoltaic\n\
    cells attached to a wearable (energy is accumulated from environmental illumination),\n\
    thermoelectric nanogenerators (the energy source is the heat produced by the human\
    \ body),\nand kinetic energy harvesters (energy is created by natural body motion).\
    \ All energy\nharvesting cases pose a fundamental challenge of effective energy\
    \ management, which\ninvolves continuous decision making regarding how much energy\
    \ to spend on sensing,\nmeasurements, on-board classiﬁcation, and transmission\
    \ (see also Section 5.2).\nWe present examples for each of the techniques mentioned\
    \ above in the context\nof wearables. Thermoelectric energy-harvesting units exploiting\
    \ self-generated human\nheat are suggested to be fabricated straight into the\
    \ textile of the garments [193]. Energy\nharvesting for activity-aware wearables\
    \ is designed by Khalifa et al. [194]. The idea is to\nremove the accelerometers,\
    \ which consume about 80% of the battery. Instead, the authors\npropose to employ\
    \ kinetic energy harvesters, which will convert human motion into\nelectrical\
    \ power. Additionally, to compensate for the accelerometers’ removal, the input\
    \ and\noutput of the kinetic energy harvester would be analyzed by a specialized\
    \ activity classiﬁer\nto track and identify the human activity (i.e., to perform\
    \ the primary task of the wearable).\nLight-based energy-harvesting wearables\
    \ are discussed by Park et al. [195]. It is noteworthy\nthat as the available\
    \ luminosity can be highly unpredictable, the overall functioning, data-\ngathering,\
    \ and transmission process would imply an optimization problem. Henceforth,\n\
    the same authors suggest a protocol to optimize the number and accuracy of interpretation\n\
    of human gestures by an energy-harvesting wearable device under an energy budget,\n\
    Park et al. [196]. To this end, they constructed an analytical model that characterizes\n\
    energy consumption based on experimental data and formulized the optimization\
    \ problem.\nEsteves et al. [197] suggest incorporating energy harvesting as part\
    \ of MAC 802.15.6. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n31 of 44\nproposed MAC modiﬁcation\
    \ includes the usage of some body sensors as relays. The\nmanaging part at a hub\
    \ (e.g., a smartphone) sets the optimal relay charging times to\nperform the data\
    \ transmission by relay effectively. A source and the relays send their\nenergy-harvesting\
    \ updates within the request for cooperation (RFC) packets. The charging\ntimes\
    \ are calculated according to the amount of energy at the source and relays and\
    \ are\nupdated in accordance with previous packet transmission success or failure.\n\
    6.2. Technological Advances\nWBAN utilization is penetrating new domains, spanning\
    \ a wide variety of sensors,\neach providing a different aspect of the monitored\
    \ subject. For example, healthcare ap-\nplications are expected to provide a wide\
    \ span of indicators from various physiological\nparameters. Speciﬁcally, to provide\
    \ a comprehensive status of the examinee, it requires, in\naddition to the standard\
    \ indicators such as heart rate and physical activity that many of us\nalready\
    \ have integrated in our watch, information at a deeper level and molecular level\n\
    insight into the dynamics of the wearer.\nTo cope with the growing popularity\
    \ of wearables and their expansion to a broader\nscope of applications, especially\
    \ in healthcare systems, with the increasing demand to\nimprove quality of service\
    \ (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE), a new generation of\nwearables has emerged.\
    \ This generation relies on several technological advances in both\nthe device\
    \ and cloud realms. The novel device technology utilizes new soft-sensing tech-\n\
    nologies, including innovative wearable materials such as conducting polymers,\
    \ rigid\nforms of hydrogel, gold and silver nanowires (to create nanowired tattoos\
    \ as stretchable\nsensors), carbon nanotubes, liquid metals, ionic liquids, and\
    \ others. These materials give\nrise to novel sensor families, such as electro-physiological\
    \ (acting on the electric potential\ndifference) physical and chemical sensors.\
    \ See the latest advances in the following related\nworks [198–200]. For example,\
    \ besides reviewing the key developments in sweat-sensing\ntechnology, Bariya\
    \ et al. [198] examine the requirements of the underlying components\nembedded\
    \ in sweat-based wearable sensors and discuss challenges for integrating wearable\n\
    sweat sensors in the development of personalized healthcare. Sweat-sensing technology\n\
    has been described earlier; see, for example, Salvo et al. [201], where a device\
    \ containing\ntwo humidity sensors located at different heights from the skin\
    \ is designed in a way that\nallows one to measure the sweat rate by the difference\
    \ in readings of these two sensing\nsub-units. Thermal comfort control by calculating\
    \ the relation between the vapor pres-\nsure and the temperature is designed into\
    \ watch-type sweat sensors by Sim et al. [202].\nSweat measurement by sweat biomarkers\
    \ (in particular, pH and Na+) is implemented\nby Song et al. [203]. In short,\
    \ the biomarkers cause a change in electric potential near the\nmeasuring device,\
    \ allowing for accurate sweat measurement during physical activity. The\nauthors\
    \ also note that the change in electrical potential allows for energy harvesting,\
    \ which\ncan be effectively managed to self-power the device and thus allow for\
    \ a battery-free design.\nIn general, the material imprinted into the working\
    \ reacting electrode determines which\nsubstance (i.e., a chemical component present\
    \ in the sweat) it will react with. For example,\nan application of electrochemical\
    \ differential pulse voltammetry to sense the sweat to\nmeasure the level of caffeine\
    \ is devised by Tai et al. [204].\nThe main challenge in the devices is to implement\
    \ capabilities of effective data gath-\nering, ﬁltering, and transmission within\
    \ microscopic computing units. Some biometric\nsensing (especially made by speciﬁc\
    \ conﬁgurations of adjacent sensor sets) produces large\namounts of data (as in\
    \ ECG sensing) that should undergo an appropriate local density\nreduction. To\
    \ ensure conformity with the sensing devices, paper lithium batteries are\nproposed\
    \ (see, e.g., [205]). In addition, many sensors are conﬁgured only to transmit\n\
    following special hazards. For example, ECG sensors should trigger an alarm in\
    \ case the\nheartbeat is abnormal. This local data processing is a preliminary\
    \ phase that facilitates\nthe more intensive data analyses in the intermediate\
    \ data collection unit (the smartphone),\nand ﬁnally, the destination server.\
    \ To treat noisiness and variability (if the sensor sampling\nfrequency is too\
    \ high) of raw data from an accelerometer or gyroscope or loss of data (if the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n32 of 44\nsensor sampling frequency is too low), variable\
    \ sampling is proposed by Li et al. [206]. The\nofﬂine ML classiﬁcation algorithm\
    \ is used to identify and predict the physical activity.\nThe recent development\
    \ of miniature sensors combined with minimization of battery\nsize and energy\
    \ harvesting advances is sometimes referred to as a new paradigm, known as\nWearables\
    \ 2. For example, Ling et al. [207] provide a detailed description of various\
    \ types\nof sensors, means of attaching them to the human body, multiple parameters\
    \ the sensors\nare capable of measuring, and techniques to communicate and process\
    \ the measured data.\n6.3. Transmission Protocols\nWe note that while many of\
    \ the works mentioned above employ a smartphone device\nwith an application that\
    \ is presumably tailored to receive data from the wearables, having\na dedicated\
    \ hardware device that would ofﬂoad some of the networking burden (e.g.,\npotential\
    \ simpliﬁcation of the packetizing process) of the sensors would be more effective\n\
    and reliable. Indeed, in Pathak et al. [208], a central processing hub allows\
    \ one to circumvent\nthe cumbersome processes of sensor identiﬁcation, sensor\
    \ joining, and reconﬁguration\nby providing a designated interface. The authors\
    \ provide real hardware implementation,\nexplore various performance metrics,\
    \ and provide energy measurements.\nSeveral available protocols for data transmission\
    \ are suitable for WBAN. We mention\nhere the low Bluetooth energy (BLE; see,\
    \ e.g., Townsend et al. [209] for a detailed protocol\nstack description and Gomez\
    \ et al. [210] for performance evaluation and comparison with\nordinary Bluetooth\
    \ and other protocols). For distances of several centimeters, near-ﬁeld\ncommunication\
    \ (NFC) protocol (see Coskun et al. [211] for the theory and Kim et al. [212]\n\
    for a description of possible device designs and applications). Details of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.6\nstandard, which covers WBAN, can be found in, for example, Kwak\
    \ et al. [213]. One sees\ntherein how the human body communications PHY layer\
    \ in particular is deﬁned.\n6.4. WBAN Applications\nEven though, as stated earlier,\
    \ there is no intention to provide a thorough review of\nWBAN applications, we\
    \ mention several interesting ones. Monitoring of workers involved\nin extreme\
    \ conditions or whose activity can be potentially dangerous (e.g., Lee et al.\
    \ [214])\nsuggest wearable sensors for monitoring miners or construction professionals.\
    \ This study\nevaluates integrated wearable sensors for measuring construction\
    \ workers’ personal level\nof workload, individual factors, and physiological\
    \ reactions during rooﬁng activities. A\nfatigue detection system for car drivers\
    \ by Chang et al. [215] includes smart glasses, which\nare able to identify possible\
    \ drowsiness by an IR detector aimed at the driver’s eyes,\nequipped with BLE\
    \ transmitter. A small processor embedded into the glasses gathers and\npre-analyzes\
    \ the data and then transmits them to the on-board computer in the car. The\n\
    latter makes a decision about whether to issue a fatigue warning and sends it\
    \ to the cloud.\nWearables can be attached to a human body in order to sense the\
    \ environment for the safety\nof the carrier, as in Wu et al. [216]. The data\
    \ (humidity and temperature) is then transmitted\nto a mobile unit, where it can\
    \ be analyzed locally or further transmitted to the cloud in order\nto issue timely\
    \ warnings. Classiﬁcation of sports activity is implemented and validated by\n\
    experiments by Qi et al. [217], where the activity is identiﬁed from accelerometer\
    \ and ECG\nmeasurements done by chest and wrist sensors. The measurements are\
    \ transmitted to a\nsmartphone, which performs the data processing. SVM is employed\
    \ for the classiﬁcation.\nYou et al. [218] suggest a real-time wireless body sensor\
    \ networks (WBSNs) scheme\nfor welfare assessment and disease monitoring, prevention,\
    \ and treatment. The suggested\nscheme is composed of three components: sensing,\
    \ communication, and management.\nSensing attains a set of physiological parameters,\
    \ such as heart rate, body temperature,\nECG, temperature, blood pressure, blood\
    \ glucose, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, from\ndesignated sensors embedded\
    \ on a smart shirt worn by the monitored user. Communi-\ncation handles the processes\
    \ of delivering the sensed physiological data and controlling\ninstructions to\
    \ a backend server through wireless networks. The transmission protocols\ncan\
    \ be divided into two segments: the transfer of information from the sensors to\
    \ a central\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n33 of 44\nterminal located at a smartphone\
    \ and the transfer of information between the smartphone\nand the designated server,\
    \ which is located on the healthcare cloud. The communication\nrelies on multiple\
    \ communication protocols including Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G (which\ncan be\
    \ replaced by 5G where available). Management is responsible for collecting, classify-\n\
    ing, and monitoring the physiological data, and furthermore, being able to issue\
    \ warning\nmessages to medical professionals or caregivers whenever the physiological\
    \ data are ab-\nnormal. Additional applications utilizing data gathering can be\
    \ found in the following\nsurvey [219].\nWe conclude by emphasizing that the beneﬁts\
    \ of WBANs have not run their course\nyet. The development of data gathering will\
    \ jointly progress with the ongoing advances\nin sensor construction and manufacturing\
    \ capability, development, and standardization\nof Wearables 2 and beyond. Development\
    \ of specialized post-processing platforms poses\na specialized challenge, and\
    \ the urge to make progress in this area is acute. To illustrate\nthis, on account\
    \ of an ever-growing population, specialized platforms for elderly care\nare needed;\
    \ see, for example, the recent papers [220,221] about wearables designated for\n\
    elderly patients and references therein.\nFinally, wearables have been recently\
    \ harnessed for combating the COVID-19 disease.\nEarly identiﬁcation of COVID-19\
    \ symptoms by evaluating the resting heart rate during the\nasymptomatic (presumably\
    \ infectious) period and analysis by a deep learning framework\nis evaluated by\
    \ Bogu and Snyder [222]. While the precision of such a tool is clearly inferior\n\
    to the standard medical assays, it may be useful to provide a preliminary alert\
    \ for the\nearly onset of the disease for people in risk groups. Hassantabar et\
    \ al. [223] suggest a\nframework termed CovidDeep that combines commercially available\
    \ wearable physiolog-\nical feature sensors (WMSs) and a simple yes/no questionnaire\
    \ with efﬁcient DNNs for\npervasive large-scale monitoring of disease onset and\
    \ health condition. The automatically\nextracted raw data and medical background\
    \ and symptom responses are combined with\nsynthetically generated data to train\
    \ the DNN architecture. Grow-and-prune synthesis is\nused to generate accurate\
    \ and computationally efﬁcient models that can be deployed for\nCOVID-19 inference.\n\
    Since viruses can spread between people who are in close contact with an infected\n\
    person, and since infected people may be asymptomatic, the pandemic taught us\
    \ that it\nis best to keep a safe distance from others (see, for example, Cortellessa\
    \ et al. [224] for\nclose-proximity risk assessment for COVID infection). Accordingly,\
    \ most health institutions\nrecommend keeping physical distance between people\
    \ in public places (commonly termed\nas ”social distancing”) in order to stop\
    \ the pandemic from spreading. Furthermore, people\nwho were in the proximity\
    \ of an infected person (tested positive for COVID) are encouraged\nto be examined,\
    \ and several governmental regulations even require such people to stay in\nquarantine.\
    \ Several recent studies have suggested leveraging wearables for contact tracing\n\
    in order to identify the hazard from close proximity. For example, Ng et al. [225]\
    \ focus on\nBluetooth low energy and discuss the different data ﬂow approaches\
    \ and the accuracy of\nsmartphone vs. smartwatch applications in proximity detection.\
    \ Bian et al. [226] utilize\nwearables to monitor social distancing as recommended\
    \ for preventing COVID-19 spread.\nIn particular, the authors design compact potentially\
    \ wearable oscillating-magnetic-ﬁeld-\nbased proximity-sensing prototype systems\
    \ suitable for the relevant safety distance and able\nto track social distancing\
    \ much more reliably than the current Bluetooth-based smartphone\ntechnology.\
    \ Shubina et al. [227] provide a brief technical overview of the main contact-\n\
    tracing approaches and the challenges they impose on wearable technology. The\
    \ paper\nalso provides a short overview of the existing solutions deployed for\
    \ contact tracing and a\ndiscussion on the potential effect of wearables in tackling\
    \ the spread of a highly contagious\nvirus. More works from the past year discuss\
    \ the use of wearables for remote management\nand automated assessment of COVID-19.\
    \ Amft et al. [228] provide an overview of insti-\ntutional initiatives and alternative,\
    \ more accurate technologies for detection of infection\nsymptoms and possible\
    \ contact with infected individuals. Channa et al. [229] is a system-\nSensors\

    \ sensors and their clinical utilization\nin screening and contact tracing.\n\
    7. Concluding Remarks\nData gathering in modern WSN and IoT networks encompasses\
    \ many challenges,\nwhich span the entire communication stack. Many techniques,\
    \ protocols, and solutions\nhave been proposed over the years, but as technology\
    \ advances, new challenges and new\nopportunities arise. In this survey, we reviewed\
    \ these main challenges and opportunities, as\nwell as recent advances, and related\
    \ them to speciﬁc data-gathering research domains. We\nprovided a comprehensive\
    \ state-of-the-art data-gathering literature review in modern WSN\nnetworks, distinguishing\
    \ between the communication layers and the research domain.\nWe ﬁrst summarized\
    \ general architectural novelties and emerging architectures. We\nreviewed several\
    \ new technological advances and their inﬂuence on sensing device design,\nthe\
    \ platform carrying it, and the transceiver. We reviewed the effect of these architectural\n\
    advantages on speciﬁc applications, such as agriculture, smart cities, smart homes.\
    \ We\nshowed how cloud computing drives new WSN types, which introduces new directions,\n\
    and discussed how WSN can coexist within social network domains. Compressed sensing\n\
    was summarized next. We provided an overview of this important scheme and reviewed\n\
    its utilization in WSNs. We proceeded with the MAC layer. Since the performance\
    \ of many\ninnovations in the higher layers rely on the underlay MAC protocol\
    \ and since many data\ngathering schemes utilize traditional WSN MAC protocols,\
    \ we provided an overview of\nthese traditional protocols and mentioned state-of-the-art\
    \ works in WSN and IoT. These\nworks devise new MAC approaches for data gathering.\
    \ Next, we covered the recent\nadvances in routing. Similarly, we opened with\
    \ an overview of the traditional routing\nprotocols utilized for data-gathering\
    \ and reviewed several recent enhancements. We\nreviewed the utilization of network\
    \ coding for data gathering and explored the facilitation\nof UAV and mobile-sink\
    \ in collecting the data from the sensors. Lastly, we turned our\nattention to\
    \ the area of wearables which opens new research horizons for human health and\n\
    activity surveillance and discussed the new paradigm of Wireless Body Area Networks.\
    \ In\nthe spirit of the times, we concluded with several studies that utilize\
    \ some of the techniques\ndiscussed in this survey to aid in combating the COVID\
    \ pandemic.\nWhile we provided the general background to the research areas we\
    \ covered, we\nmainly focused on cutting-edge research works. Yet we note that\
    \ even seemingly exhausted\ntopics, such as MAC and Routing protocols, provide\
    \ new technological developments and\npresent opportunities for new research domains.\n\
    As implied throughout this survey, there are several research areas that attract\
    \ a\nlot of attention and anticipation for future developments. For example, technological\n\
    innovations in manufacturing more compact sensing units with yet superior transmission,\n\
    reception and processing capabilities are extremely in demand in several disciplines\
    \ which\ninclude wearables, smart homes, IoT-related domains and others. All the\
    \ more so, this\nis relevant when dealing with healthcare applications and implants.\
    \ Such technological\ninnovations will require in turn enhancements to other domains\
    \ across the communication\nstack in order to adjust to the new opportunities\
    \ and limitations. Energy acquisition is\nstill a fruitful research domain. In\
    \ this respect, ﬁnding new sources of energy harvesting\n(EH), better utilization\
    \ of existing energy resources and energy storage are still challenging\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds. Similarly, new EH methods impose multiple new challenges on the entire\n\
    protocol stack, which are correlated with the EH method, e.g., different EH methods\
    \ dictate\nconstraints on the MAC design, which in turn, impact the routing protocol\
    \ which affects\nthe performance end eventually the application utilizing the\
    \ infrastructure. The growth of\nsuch networks supporting a variety of heterogeneous\
    \ devices of communication standards\nand their increasing density requires more\
    \ effective data compression techniques and\nefﬁcient on-grid data analyses (i.e.,\
    \ even prior to data delivery to sinks). On the off-grid\nside of WSNs, we note\
    \ that consistent progress in Cloud Computing (CC) technology and\nexploitation\
    \ methodology will open new horizons in data analysis.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    35 of 44\nDeployment of Edge Computing units cooperating with sensing-capable\
    \ units will\nimply the development of novel data-gathering schemes. As WSN density\
    \ increases,\nchallenges in the gathering of useful data by WSN and its consequent\
    \ analysis will coincide\nwith those of Big Data. Clearly, the processes of such\
    \ analyses should be implemented\nwithin Cloud Computing systems. The fashion\
    \ of the CC physical resources deployed in\norder to efﬁciently interact with\
    \ WSN is not necessarily similar to those of usual IT-to-CC\nconnectivity. It\
    \ is not currently properly standardized and, most importantly, it is not\nclear\
    \ how correctly CC (e.g., which HW, correct deployment of Access Points) should\
    \ be\ncross-planned with a particular WSN. Issues of security and privacy which\
    \ are not covered\nin this survey will continue to elicit a major interest, especially\
    \ in keeping with evolving\nhealth care applications. The growth of the network\
    \ and their variability will require a\ngreater measure of adoption of ML and\
    \ AI methods and the development of such new\nspecialized methods for WSN in the\
    \ very near future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConﬂicts\

  explanation: 'This paper focuses on the role of automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management. It explores how these systems can contribute to efficient
    water resource use and enhance agricultural productivity while highlighting the
    importance of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration
    of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.


    The system begins with data collection from various sources, such as sensors and
    remote monitoring systems. This data is then transmitted to edge and fog computing
    devices for real-time processing. The processed data is sent to a cloud platform
    for further analysis and decision-making, and the resulting decisions are then
    sent back to the irrigation system for implementation.


    The authors emphasize the significance of open standards and interoperability
    to ensure seamless integration and communication among different components of
    the automated irrigation management system. They present a case study of a system
    that collects data from soil moisture sensors and uses real-time processing to
    adjust irrigation schedules, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in
    optimizing water usage.


    Overall, this paper provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits
    of automated real-time irrigation management systems, highlighting their potential
    to improve water efficiency and enhance agricultural productivity.'

    of multi-purpose decision support. • We deliver pull- and push-based conditioned
    information. • Information is tailored to stakeholder demands via standardised
    web services. • We turn field observations into useful real-time decision support
    information. Abstract Within the last decades tremendous progress has been made
    in analysing, characterising and understanding the processes, functions, and structures
    of the environment. Numerous indicators have been proposed and operationalised
    using computing techniques. However, many of the approaches are based on specific
    case study areas and the transfer of approaches is hampered due to incompatible
    data formats, data availability limitations, and/or unavailable modelling routines.
    Information on modelling routines, existing result datasets, and updates of previously
    derived analyses are missing. Considering the recent technological and methodological
    developments, environmental modelling providing indicators for decision support
    is likely to change in the next decade. This research provides a heuristic conceptual
    basis for driving the next generation of real-time multi-purpose data assembling,
    evaluating, modelling, and visualisation towards the operationalisation of decisions.
    Turning field observations into useful (near) real-time decision support information
    is demonstrated based on a hydrological example of future Integrated Water Resources
    Management. This paper describes new ways of near real-time indicator processing
    using Wireless Sensor Networks and standardised web services. Publicly available

    WebGISSensorsSDIEarly warning systemWater resources managementOGC 1. Introduction
    The environment is multi-dimensional, multi-functional, inherently complex, of
    transdisciplinary nature and highly dynamic (Grabaum and Meyer, 1998, Tress et
    al., 2003, de Groot, 2006). The interwoven nature of real-world problems challenges
    for higher-order transdisciplinary systems thinking. Holistic-integrated approaches
    are needed to apply state-of-the-art knowledge to explain, explore, and predict
    landscape phenomena to ensure proper mitigation strategies. Most importantly,
    location-based environmental information is required in near real time in crisis
    situations to ensure timely adaptation. Example stressors are climatological extreme
    events or overexploitation of water resources. To analyse and describe conditions
    such as extreme precipitation and overuse of groundwater resources e.g. for irrigation
    purposes, many ecological modelling routines resulting in indicator proposals
    have been developed. Among the modelling routines are many hydrological modelling
    examples specifically dedicated for irrigation needs (Blaney and Criddle, 1950,
    Minacapilli et al., 2008, Wriedt et al., 2009, Dechmi et al., 2012), ecological
    minimum flow in rivers (Thomas et al., 2011, Gao et al., 2010), or flooding (e.g.
    Ahmad and Simonovic, 2006). With the introduction of the European Water framework
    Directive (Directive, 2000/60/EC) researchers increasingly consider the analysis
    of these single components in an integrated way. Thus, integrated environmental
    modelling became a vision and roadmap for the future (Laniak et al., 2013, Granell
    et al., 2013). Both modelling and monitoring efforts are considered as the key
    for sustainable environmental planning (Jorgensen et al., 2007) resulting in environmental
    decision support systems rapidly progressing since the beginning of this century
    (Matthies et al., 2007). Interdisciplinary and multi-purpose integrated models
    are becoming more important but also more complex (Voinov and Cerco, 2010, Pahl-Wostl,
    2007). Multi-purpose examples are “Coupling a hydrological water quality model
    and an economic optimisation model to set up a cost-effective emission reduction
    countermeasure scenario for nitrogen” (Cools et al., 2011) or “An integrated approach
    to linking economic valuation and catchment modelling” (Kragt et al., 2011). However,
    both examples did not consider real time measurements for modelling despite the
    fact that Hart and Martinez (2006) already insinuate the importance of real-time
    environmental information from sensor networks for better process-understanding
    and informed decision making. Wireless sensor networks are available since decades
    and have been regularly reviewed and continuously improved (Akyildiz et al., 2002,
    Baronti et al., 2007, Yick et al., 2008, Schimak et al., 2010). However, all before
    mentioned approaches did not thoroughly consider the standardised data distribution.
    Usländer et al. (2010) and Díaz et al. (2013) provide insight in designing environmental
    software applications based upon an open sensor service architecture, however,
    they did not discuss the coupling to real-time modelling and pull and push based
    conditioned information delivery. Moreover, without proper measures for validation,
    model (auto-)calibration is hardly achieved (Raj Shrestha and Rode, 2008, Green
    and van Griensven, 2008). Streamlining inputs and outputs of data from and to
    models and the implications of complexity and uncertainty for integrated modelling
    and impact assessments are a big scientific and technical challenge and need to
    be considered as equally important as uncertainty propagation (Beven, 2000, Refsgaard
    et al., 2007, Krysanova et al., 2007). Thus, with increasing complexity the uncertainty
    of model results increases and there is a strong need for emulation techniques
    for the reduction and sensitivity analysis of complex environmental models (Ratto
    et al., 2012, Makler-Pick et al., 2011, Andrews et al., 2011, Crout et al., 2009,
    Ziehn and Tomlin, 2009, Reusser and Zehe, 2011, Guse et al., 2014). As discussed
    by (Klug and Kmoch, 2014a, Klug and Kmoch, 2014b), the challenge is that many
    of the modelling approaches need a thorough data basis as a foundation but spatial
    data for integrated environmental modelling is scattered and difficult to obtain,
    publicly unavailable and data access is hampered. In consequence a lot of time
    resources and costs need to be invested for state of the art data acquisition.
    Subsequently, updates of previous indicator modelling results are almost unavailable
    on a real-time basis since real-time data are rarely accessible. Spatially continuous
    modelling exercises across administrative and/or state boundaries are impossible
    yet since interoperable – technically and semantically harmonised and standardised
    – datasets and modelling interfaces are not exhaustedly available (Horsburgh et
    al., 2014). Furthermore, software routines for environmental modelling often are
    neither publicly accessible nor do they support standardised data interfaces for
    their integration. Thus, repeatability and transferability of approaches are hampered.
    Modelling tools and software often are not well described to properly exploit
    the full modelling power. Automated interchanges of model results are presently
    almost unavailable (Granell et al., 2013). As a consequence of lacking near real
    time data access in a proper ready to use interoperable format, events such as
    flooding from heavy rainfall are rather post-processed than forecasted. This lacks
    proper preparation on extreme events causing for instance people, infrastructure
    and the environment at risk in flooding times. Thus, the main future challenge
    is to complete and automate the workflow from initial data capturing to the real-time
    provision of conditioned information delivery to end users for prepared decision
    making. With this manuscript we provide a science base structure to organise and
    technically implement transdisciplinary multi-purpose knowledge and indicator
    approaches for near real time decision making with a call for pro-active local
    action to prevent stress to human and the environment in six main stages. This
    places decision makers and stakeholders in the situation to estimate the landscape
    capability, resilience, vulnerability and loading capacity of the environmental
    balance to avoid irretrievable damages to humans and the environment. We increase
    understanding of the possibilities for a web based data and information sharing
    framework of near real time environmental status delivery with access to environmental
    models utilising common data interfaces to provide indicators for advanced decision
    support. The reflection of the comprehensive framework setup for near real-time
    indicator updates is exemplified on a hydrological example. We consider flood
    conditions and human interventions effecting changes of groundwater tables. We
    discourse the future research direction of real-time decision making that helps
    addressing “what if” questions to adapt against certain environmental or more
    specifically climate change impacts. We provide a scientific framework to organise
    and technically implement transdisciplinary multi-purpose knowledge and indicator
    approaches for near real time decision making with a call for action to prevent
    stress to humans and the environment. We hypothesise that with publicly available
    near real time environmental measurements accessible in standardised data formats
    we are able to drive modelling routines on request and provide messages on present
    and future environmental conditions to those who need them. With present available
    methodologies, technologies, and internationally accepted standards we are able
    to provide real-time information on the state of the environment indicators from
    distributed data sources to allow concrete mitigation action for conflicts of
    interests coming into force at local level. 2. The real time indicator framework
    Comprehensive and integrated spatial planning presupposes a high degree of on-site
    knowledge (Klug, 2012). Considering specific conditions, vulnerabilities, risks
    and interdependencies, real-time multi-purpose conditioned information delivery
    is a great mental and conceptual challenge across applications, scientific disciplines,
    technology, and communities where many parameters need to be connected in a proper
    way. Thus, comprehensive and integrated environmental planning presupposes a high
    degree of technical and interdisciplinary knowledge and experiences. (Electro-)
    technical and engineering skills are required to setup the wireless sensor network
    infrastructure while Geographic Information Science (GIScience) is providing insight
    to the spatial relationships and the Spatial Data Infrastructure. The hydrology
    domain provides the methodological frameworks on Integrated Water Resources Management
    (IWRM). The modelling is strongly coupled to GIScience but also includes disciplines
    such as soil sciences and climatology when considering the entire water cycle.
    Once water consumption is considered, social and economic domains come into play
    as well. Fig. 1 shows the theoretical background of our proposed complete and
    automated concept from initial data capturing to the real-time provision of conditioned
    information delivery to end users for prepared decision making. The following
    subchapters describe our concept regardless of context or scientific domain but
    explain it on hydrological examples we are working on. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. From in situ measurements to advance near real-time decision making.
    2.1. Near real time measurements Monitoring is a continuous observation of an
    environmental parameter at a certain place over a certain time period contributing
    to a better understanding of environmental processes and functions (Hart and Martinez,
    2006). This monitoring can be done with in situ sensors (ground sensor devices)
    or ex situ sensors (e.g. satellites). With the focus on in situ sensors Bröring
    et al. (2011) demonstrated that “integrating diverse sensors into observation
    systems is not straightforward”. However, with the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGC) compliant Sensor Web Enablement Botts et al. (2008) show how to distribute
    interoperable, platform-independent environmental information in a uniform way.
    The setup might collect data centrally from many sensor nodes or it is a node
    and gateway at the same time. Possible individual sensor network setups are (already)
    outlined in Morreale et al. (2011), Kawai et al. (2009) and Kafetzoglou and Papavassiliou
    (2011). We consider the following points as most important for transferability
    and reusability of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) developments: • implementation
    of high quality but low cost and low energy consuming sensors capturing environmental
    information at a higher density in space with the same investment budget, • ensuring
    platform independency (e.g. MacOS, Linux, Windows) and open source developments
    on server and client side for transferable and multi-purpose uses, • enabling
    energy autarchic systems for a place independent positioning of sensors without
    the need of a power grid connection, and • applying internationally recognised
    data transmission standards (e.g. ZigBEE, WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM/UMTS/EDGE/HSDPA/HSUPA/LTE,
    satellite connection) to ensure global near real time access of datasets. 2.2.
    Sensor gateway 2.2.1. Central functionalities The central element of the locally
    installed Wireless Sensor Network is the gateway located in the field to collect
    the sensor information from the sensor nodes. Ensuring platform independency,
    this gateway can be a MacOS, Linux or Windows system designed to store raw incoming
    environmental information like a data logger. Raw datasets are either stored file
    based or in a database (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL) and then distributed to the
    internet via OGC compliant Sensor Observation Service (see Section 2.3) using
    the wireless transmission standards as described in Fig. 1. 2.2.2. Advanced functionalities
    2.2.2.1. Data transformation and quality control The central gateway converts
    raw data from voltage or resistance into proper measurements such as wind direction
    (instead of a resistance value) or wind speed (instead of a number of rotations
    in time) (Jardak et al., 2010, Han et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2010, Terzis et
    al., 2010). Domain specific modelling procedures from climatology or hydrology
    check data validity. These procedures are placed in between the database and the
    submission to the Sensor Observation Service (SOS, OGC, 2012a) to provide reliable,
    understandable and publicly accessible information. Thus, the sensor gateway is
    closely connected to the indicator modelling environment described in stage 5.
    2.2.2.2. Measurement logic Usually the measurement interval is unique and dependent
    on the application context or the data provider''s preferences. However, in a
    multi-purpose context the status of the measuring interval might need to change
    to higher or lower frequencies. Under ‘normal conditions’ the sensors might perform
    measurements in a 15 min interval. This interval might not be considered sufficient
    for ‘unexpected conditions’ such as extreme precipitation events where for instance
    discharge measurement information should be delivered in a 5 min interval. Thus,
    sensor configuration needs to be adjustable on-demand. Rule sets define changes
    between the sleep and awake cycle of sensor nodes and thus the time interval for
    measurements. The rule sets are based on anthropogenic triggers or direct measurements
    from one or more sensors. The Sensor Planning Service (SPS, OGC, 2011c) and Sensor
    Event Service (SES, OGC, 2011b) provide updates of the measurement frequency in
    times where the sensor is awake. The specific environmental conditions observed
    define the intervals. 2.2.2.3. Alert logic At the same time as sensors change
    their configuration, they can trigger notifications via SMS, email or mobile app
    alert. These messages might contain single environmental conditions or reports
    derived from environmental indicator models. Thus, alert messages are defined
    based on indicators but might have different meanings to different stakeholders.
    Therefore, alert messages based on indicators need to be ‘translated’ into understandable
    user defined messages (see Section 2.6.1). 2.3. Standards While the previously
    described stages are usually based on individual setups (data transmission routines,
    database structures, etc.), the standard compliant distribution and access to
    data is a central component to ensure interoperability and the interplay and union
    of different distributed time series datasets and indicator models. In our framework
    in Fig. 1 the gateway delivers the measurements via a SOS compliant connector
    library to the Sensor Observation Service. Field measurements are streamed via
    SOS in the data formats Observations and Measurements (O&M, OGC, 2011a) and Water
    Markup Language (WaterML2.0, OGC, 2012b) from distributed sources into modelling
    and simulation applications mentioned in stage five. These indicator models are
    implemented as Web Processing Services (WPS, OGC, 2007b) and provide indicator
    results, which are linked with advanced decision support as outlined in stage
    six. Environmental modelling routines for policy support are already available
    for instance in Lux and Matthews (2007), Letcher and Giupponi (2005), and Cuddy
    and Gandolfi (2004). To ensure the capability to rapidly discover available resources
    central knowledge portals interconnected via Catalogue Service Web (CSW, OGC,
    2007a) interface, an implementation as described by Klug and Kmoch, 2014a, Klug
    and Kmoch, 2014b is helpful. 2.4. Data interfaces and transfer rules Real time
    datasets from stage 1 connect to models deriving indicators in stage 5. However,
    as described in Klug and Bretz (2012) and Klug and Kmoch, 2014a, Klug and Kmoch,
    2014b many datasets exist in different formats and national standards. For application-neutral
    encoding of geoscience thematic content GeoSciML (Sen and Duffy, 2005), GroundwaterML
    and WaterML as standard based data formats are now developed under the governance
    of the OGC and allow exchange of digital, interoperable geospatial information
    between data providers, users and models. Thus, these GML (Geographic Markup Language)
    application schemes enable technically and semantically harmonised data transfer
    via comparable content and format. 2.5. Indicator development Already pre-processed
    and standardised datasets are fed into the indicator modelling environment. Indicator
    modelling routines expressed as analytical algorithms to data can range from simple
    algorithms (e.g. selection of min, max, or median value) to complex algorithms
    reading contemporaneous sets of information coming from different distributed
    data sources but the same format. Advanced data fusion algorithms lead to back-,
    now- and forecasting results presenting the previous or present state of the environment
    or the course of its development as spatially explicit results (Havlik et al.,
    2011). To ensure a broad use and understanding of modelling results, scientists
    but also stakeholders and decision makers need to get insight into the appropriateness
    of modelling routines. Nativi et al. (2013) proposed the provision of models in
    a service oriented approach to increase model access and sharing possibility while
    Castronova et al. (2013b) proposed an integrated modelling within a hydrologic
    information system using an Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) based approach (The
    Open Association Technical Committee, 2010a, The Open Association Technical Committee,
    2010b, Castronova et al., 2013a, Knapen et al., 2013). OpenMI defines how independently
    developed computer models of environmental processes can exchange data at run
    time. This facilitates the integrated modelling of interacting processes to understand
    Earth system processes to be translated into proper decision support messages.
    Similar to the Object Modelling System (OMS3, David et al., 2013) as a modelling
    framework for component-based model and simulation development on multiple platforms,
    OpenMI can be used as a model integration platform across disciplines (Knapen
    et al., 2013). Special interest groups such as the Community Surface Dynamics
    Modelling System (CSDMS) provide models of the earth surface processes and disseminate
    these as integrated software modules to be used on dynamics modelling systems
    (Overeem et al., 2013). Similar is the Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF,
    http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/index.shtml) for building and coupling weather,
    climate, and related models. Real time model runs enable the immediate validation
    of environmental conditions against defined (inter-)national indicator standards/thresholds
    (e.g. water quantity). Comparisons to previous measurements and thus trends can
    be communicated in real time. However, since models are a simple representation
    of the complex environment and datasets bear some vagueness as well, we regard
    uncertainty modelling and a provision of uncertainty measures incorporated in
    the indicator modelling stage. UncertWeb can be considered as the basis for this
    challenge (Bastin et al., 2013). 2.6. Information distribution Turning data into
    useful information is the key for better informed decision making. Information
    needs to be delivered in different formats dependent on the level of knowledge
    and the responsible stake. Thus, the information distribution varies according
    to end user demands and categories. Primary datasets (e.g. raw data or pre-processed
    quality controlled data from stage 2) or secondary datasets (e.g. resulting from
    the environmental indicator modelling in stage 5) are available in tabular form,
    in figures, or as maps. These tables, figures or graphs might not be appropriate
    since interpretation of results and respective action items are missing. Important
    is the provisioning of solutions tailored to end user demands. 2.6.1. Conditioned
    information delivery The information conditioning refers to the reduction of complex,
    multidimensional and highly dynamic environmental information to responsible persons
    (e.g. blue light organisations) but also to the public. We consider the conditioned
    information delivery as a structured synthesis of given conditions and as a learning
    process by which the importance of single information pieces become dependent
    on the users interacting with the system. As specified by Klug and Kmoch, 2014a,
    Klug and Kmoch, 2014b “the provision of ‘conditioned information’ is the separation
    of the crucial from the tangential; thus ‘essentialising’ those items which are
    most important for the users”. This information reduction is especially important
    in crisis times where time resources are needed for action rather than interpretation
    of complex results. Thus decision makers require concise information on a timely
    basis to base their decisions on the latest state of the environment. To underpin
    stakeholders’ decisions, information about the accuracy/uncertainty and the context
    dependent interpretation is required as described in stage 5. The transformation
    of raw data through modelling to environmental indicators need to follow a further
    refinement through interpretation of findings and expressing those interpretations
    in an end user understandable way. End users for certain environmental conditions
    have different acting roles and thus information needs to be tailored accordingly.
    Thus, user centred information distribution to different user groups e.g. stakeholders,
    actors, public people is the key for immediate and proper action to prevent hazardous
    events such as heavy rainfall events causing floods or overconsumption of groundwater
    leading to decreasing groundwater tables (see Section 3). 2.6.2. Pull based information
    retrieval Pull based information retrieval requires users actively taking action
    to receive information from a web service. They either take accessible datasets
    to their desktop environment or access information directly from the web services.
    Advanced users directly feed real time data into their desktop modelling routines
    (without copying the datasets) and derive end user demanded results. These time
    series datasets usually are available in an XML based machine readable format
    and/or data file download. In a second possibility users actively consume ready
    to use information via web services as • observations in tabular (e.g. CSV) or
    diagram format, • point datasets with observations on a map, • mono-thematic conventional
    spatially distributed modelling result from WPS routines (e.g. spatially explicit
    temperature distribution) where time sliders might provide the opportunity to
    discover spatial-temporal changes in a WXS (Web Map Service, Web Feature Service,
    Web Coverage Service, etc.), • multi-thematic integrated modelling results retrieved
    from e.g. indicator modelling approaches provided as conditioned information.
    2.6.3. Push based information retrieval We consider a push based information distribution
    supportive for pro-active planning and early decision making. Participants register
    at a service and receive status information as short message (SMS), email or mobile
    app notification on the environmental conditions. Messages are triggered via a
    Web Notification Service (WNS), Sensor Planning Service (SPS), and Sensor Event
    Service (SES). Messages are customised to end user needs and report for instance
    single measurement values or a defined status message based on developed rule
    sets. The status message can be accompanied with action tasks related to the specific
    circumstance the message was triggered by (see Section 3). 3. An early warning
    system as an application example IWRM should be addressed by a comprehensive Early
    Warning System (EWS). The EWS should be developed as a multi-purpose instrument
    observing, monitoring, analysing and informing about the present state of the
    environment. A hydrological EWS should be based on real time hydro-pedo-meteorological
    observations at field stations. Knowledge and experiences from these observations
    can be used to set-up combined natural scientific and anthropogenic models to
    characterise the present situation and likely future scenarios. Historical datasets
    help understanding the past and recent variability and trends in water resources
    conditions. This ensures strategic political and integrated water resource management
    decision support for the prevention and anticipation of water related stress situation
    on a general level. The EWS as a decision support system (DSS) analyses water
    stress and helps drafting decisions for potential crisis situations. These decisions
    might answer questions like “When we are likely affected by an extreme precipitation
    event?” On a short term basis the EWS should be able to take action for a crisis
    situation already in place or expected soon. Short term water stress situations
    have different meanings. In expected heavy rainfall events information need to
    be available up to 72 h in advance the event is expected to happen. Forecasts
    need to be revised on a 12- (better 6-) hourly bases. Forecasting for instance
    water scarcity can be based on a longer time period of about a week to a month
    dependent on the focal region. 3.1. Now- and forecasting For the now-casting in
    situ measurements provide the present state of the environment from the sensors
    as described in stage 1 (e.g. soil moisture level, discharge conditions). At the
    same time, models such as (WRF-ARW Model, http://wrf.rometex.org/) use real time
    in situ measurements to forecast meteorological parameters such as precipitation
    up to 48 h in advance on an hourly base. Result datasets are provided as GeoTiff
    raster files and can be made accessible via standardised interfaces such as Web
    Coverage Services. Integrating both standardised input datasets into a web based
    OpenMI compliant hydrological modelling system would enable a spatially explicit
    forecast of runoff conditions and flooding probability in 48 h ahead. However,
    this flooding probability is based on numerous parameters which are not easily
    to be discovered by end users. Thus tailored rule sets on information delivery
    need to be established. 3.2. Rule sets in the framework of multi-purpose decision
    making As outlined in Potschin et al. (2010) setting up of technical infrastructures
    supporting environmental planning is not enough. Priority weighting, setting of
    preferences and stating decisions in water crisis situations is indispensable.
    Rule sets as mentioned in stage 2 are data processing algorithms representing
    latest scientific knowledge and automated reasoning on past, present and forecasted
    datasets. The sensor logic can be multi-purpose, e.g. delivering information at
    low groundwater levels indicating an ecological minimum flow in near rivers or
    at high water level indicating flooding. Low soil moisture levels might turn on
    an irrigation system or triggers a flood warning message at full saturation level.
    Combined with rain forecast models resulting from stage 5 the forecasted amount
    of rain and the present in situ condition provide an indication on the alert level
    and the respective adaptation information. Example 1 Flooding Heavy rainfall events
    detected at the rain gauges trigger higher frequency measurements of other devices
    in the catchment. This should ensure a better understanding of spatial–temporal
    interdependencies of water flow processes. Thus, in case a (to be locally defined)
    amount of rain passes the rain gauge, discharge, water table, and soil moisture
    measurement intervals are updated to a higher frequency. The frequency is reduced
    back to ‘normal conditions’ after a (locally to be defined) time after the latest
    recognised rainfall event. The same is true for the snow melting period where
    the (locally to be defined) changes in snow water equivalent measurements trigger
    the before mentioned devices. Example 2 Water scarcity Low groundwater levels
    often correlate to increased groundwater exploitation due to irrigation purposes
    in water scarce times causing reduced discharge rate affecting the ecologically
    required minimum flow in rivers. Thus, (locally to be defined) groundwater levels
    trigger the discharge measurement frequency and the water abstraction rates. SOS
    available groundwater levels are correlated with rain forecast and municipal and
    agricultural water abstraction/allocation schemes to reduce over-consumption and
    environmental impact. Again early notifications of states and trends with simple
    green, yellow, red warning indication of expected criticality is ensured with
    respective explanation of further decision acts for different stakeholders. Couplings
    with utilities/local water supplier ITC systems for integrated management would
    help to balance the water demands from different parties including the environment.
    3.3. Information distribution Based on an evaluation of impacts and relevancies
    the adaptation strategies with defined countermeasures should take local action
    which requires a proper understanding of the hydro-meteorological conditions and
    the affected people and environment. The EWS should enable knowledge-based decision
    making by combining (real time) data and models. An early warning system for us
    directly relates to the push-based information distribution. As discussed, tailored
    information is considered the key for proper decisions for people with different
    responsibilities. To demonstrate the multi-purpose decision making framework and
    the tailored information distribution to different actors we provide simple examples
    from IWRM in Table 1. Table 1. Examples of multi-purpose decision making with
    different actors. Actor Driving force Pressure State Impact Response Municipality

    of water Please reduce your water consumption. Do not wash cars or watering the
    garden. Keep your hygiene showers short The design of the monitoring programme
    and the frequency of collecting data are implicitly grounded in the demand for
    multi-purpose decision making. The decision support is either based on the measurements
    or the modelling results while the action items relate to the interpretation of
    results. For instance, driving forces of environmental conditions (soil water
    content in volume percent, expected rainfall in millimetres) are formulated as
    pressure or problem statement (a fully water saturated soil and forecasted heavy
    rainfall might lead to flooding). The state describes the present conditions which
    in case of the expected rainfall event might change to critical levels. The related
    impact corresponds to the alert level, which is dependent on the specific present
    and/or forecasted environmental condition. Impacts based on the conditions are
    outlined and concerns expressed (certain infrastructure might be at risk and cellars
    likely at risk being flooded). Based on present knowledge and the conditions of
    the environment decision opportunities detailed responses are provided as pro-active
    statements (e.g. start filling sand bags and place them to certain places to prevent
    cellars being flooded). 4. Discussion The constitutive objective of this research
    was to capture the basic characteristics from in situ measurements, standard compliant
    real-time transmission of environmental measures, integration of measures to standardised
    modelling frameworks and provision of sound indicators for advanced decision making
    and calls for (adaptation) actions. The proposed framework places stakeholders
    and decision makers in the situation to access the real-time state of the environment
    but also condensed conditioned information. This enables the users to estimate
    the landscape capability, resilience and loading capacity with respect to water
    resources examples. This is consequently to ensure the proper functioning of natural
    processes and human security and avoid irreversible damages to the environmental
    integrity. From the methodological point of view, a unique analysis and decision
    planning support framework has been investigated. It incorporates the design of
    near real time observations and modelling routines considering spatially explicit
    indicator models with reference to natural processes, functions, structure, and
    change while offering tailor made decision support to respective stakeholders.
    Different information sources are synthesised in one framework. It enables stakeholders
    to predict ecological consequences from near real time point observations and
    spatially explicit modelling results in a multi-purpose planning environment.
    Being based on automated procedures, the concept serves as a transparent basis
    on decisions taken. It provides criteria for continuous control of environmental
    resources through a near real time monitoring process. Monitoring and high frequency
    information supply about the environment challenges scientific knowledge through
    their constant flux. Our own understanding about environmental processes continually
    evolves with new observations and requires reviewing the rule sets triggering
    other sensors or alert messages. Despite many procedures could be automated already,
    the automated incorporation of updated knowledge gained from the analysis of in
    situ measurements as a self-learning system mechanism is a future challenge. For
    proper decision making the validity for the masses of data need to be guaranteed;
    especially if the dataset should be directly used in forecasting models before
    and during crisis times. Existing meteorological and hydrological mathematical
    and/or statistical methods implemented as Web Processing Services help automating
    data validation to certain extend. However, manual data quality validation is
    needed for sustained quality controlled dataset but not for real-time applications.
    Data validity and thus uncertainty quantification is a scientifically challenging
    part; especially when not only observing single point measurements but spatially
    explicit modelling results. The higher the complexity of a model is, the lower
    is the prediction power that can be expected. The complexity of the model(s) used
    for spatial interpolation generally reflects the end user needs and is limited
    by the considered spatial–temporal scale (resolution and extend) and the cloud
    computing power. Also the data transfer from the data repositories to the modelling
    routine might be limited when considering big data analysis. However, data integration
    into models should be straightforward if the data interfaces on data provider
    and modelling side are standardised. Since the proposed concept enables human
    or sensor based changes of the measurement frequency of single sensors there might
    be a discontinuity in the data records causing impacts on data handling and evaluation.
    This is true if the overall sensing concept is designed arbitrarily. The measuring
    concept need to follow a rule based structure ensuring all required sensors measure
    at the same time to ensure a cross-comparison of environmental values. The frequency
    of these joint measurements depend on (i) the spatial–temporal scale of the analyses
    performed in the landscape and (ii) the reaction and/or processing time of the
    sensor itself. From a transdisciplinary multi-purpose decision making perspective,
    modelling with stakeholders (Voinov and Bousquet, 2010) – as done for the exercise
    leading to Table 1 – increases acceptance and impacts of scientific efforts. Scenario
    analysis is possible in real-time using a usual web browser. In the future this
    would increase the value of for instance landscape development after the Leitbild
    approach as described in Klug (2012). Changes in spatial processes, functions
    and structures can be visualised tailor made to the stakeholder needs with latest
    cartographic and technological standards. Benefits will arise from free and open
    source software and open standard developments. This organised transdisciplinary
    working environment according to scientific procedures (Scholten et al., 2007,
    Castelletti and Soncini-Sessa, 2006) creates trust in the decision support system
    and stakeholders are expected to take stewardship of developments they are able
    to use in their day to day work. While the labour force on the development of
    the system might be high, the maintenance of the system is expected to be moderate
    compared to the gain of frequently captured measurements of the system. While
    the scientific labour force for setting up the proposed concept and fine tuning
    data validity (dependent on the landscape analysis topic) is high, the applicability
    in our experience is not limited to available manpower. However, a permanent human
    control of model output in real-time is impossible but also not necessary. If
    sensor values remain critical after the rule-based filtering, the responsible
    person can be informed on potential data inconsistencies via the notification
    service. The provision of conditioned information is semi-automated and is based
    on rules to reduce respective work load. The rules as shown in Table 1 are very
    simple and in our case neglect possible conflicts between stakeholders. However,
    these transdisciplinary conflicts need to be addressed with all involved parties
    during the course of rule set definition and need to be reflected in the messages
    to be sent out. 5. Conclusion This paper capitalises already existing knowledge
    and synthesises it into a new stage of higher-order systems integration providing
    new context and situation specific information. Bringing primary and secondary
    derived data and models together into one single decision support framework and
    advancing it by the delivery of end user tailored push messages is a major future
    challenge for a transdisciplinary science still in its infancy. Wireless Sensor
    Networks for monitoring water flows and water abstractions ensure the timely provision
    of spatially explicit information to reduce delay times in data provision for
    a real-time decision making. Spatially enabled databases and consequent standard
    compliant data services serve as connecting elements in a greater distributed
    Spatial Data Infrastructure bundled in a one-stop-shop central portal to obtain
    datasets from distributed sources. 6. Outlook Interactive natural resources modelling
    will enhance the understanding of the dynamics under various conditions as well
    as the impact of single modifications of the system conditions (Boschetti et al.,
    2010). Understanding the single relationships of nature through a quantification
    of the environmental benefits or impacts of practices can be facilitated (White
    et al., 2010). Integration of further economic software modules might also support
    transparent decision making on countermeasures or compensation payments where
    appropriate (Marinoni et al., 2009, Ulbrich et al., 2008). The modularity of the
    approach (i) enables a reduction or extension of the complexity, (ii) facilitates
    an exchange of single components according to the case study/thematic best fit,
    and (iii) enables the transferability of approaches to different areas. Comparability
    and transparency of results are considered as highly important as explained in
    Potschin and Klug (2010). From the technological viewpoint, the progressive character
    of this approach provides transparent and pursuable tools to monitor, analyse,
    and inform stakeholders about environmental conditions and changes. Whereas earlier
    indicator approaches were impacted by inconsistent data formats and model access,
    future exercises will increasingly benefit from distributed geodatabases with
    common open data formats, interfaces and models providing access towards multi-functional
    approaches. These capabilities correspond with the increasing complexity of environments
    but its employment leads to a promising integrated, transdisciplinary and multi-purpose
    decision making approach. The latter is expected to reduce costs while using free
    and open source tools, open standards and interfaces, publicly and free of charge
    datasets and due to its pro-active and timely decision making ensuring the avoidance
    of damage costs. Also the onerous, expensive, time consuming, and often bewildering
    development and adaptation of models for the resource managers could be avoided
    (Caminiti, 2004). Standard compliant interfaces for data distribution and model
    integration reduce the burdens of data pre-processing or model adaptation. However,
    we see that for instance the INSPIRE process towards harmonised and seamlessly
    available geodata across Europe has not finished yet and full comprehensive modelling
    across boarders still need some time to come. Nevertheless, the potential of using
    standardised spatial data infrastructure and the visualisation of spatial information
    are already available. Especially web-based mapping products bear the powerful
    potential to visualise complex interdisciplinary situations quite simple and is
    supporting decision making at local and regional level. Online based continuously
    updated web services help monitoring the environmental conditions on a frequent
    basis (Chapman, 2012) and according to the European Environmental Information
    Directive (European Commission, 2003/4/EC) the public is kept informed. Science
    should provide access to the modelling resources and make them available as open
    source. Models should comply with international standards to ensure interoperability,
    comparability, transferability and integration in holistic coupled approaches.
    Science should contribute to the open data initiative to ensure integration in
    data hungry models. Data, tools and models should be made available online but
    still remain at the location where they are maintained. Once approved, certified
    data, tools and methods should be registered at one to be defined place to ensure
    people finding the resources demanded. Acknowledgements The authors wish to acknowledge

    most of the cooperatives studied, performance measurement systems are in the process

    Technological Survey on the Dependable Self-Management CPS: From Self-Adaptive
    Architecture to Self-Management Strategies. Sensors 2019, 19, 1033. Abstract Cyber
    Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The
    dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and rare survey has been published
    in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary
    technologies. To avoid human error and to simplify management, self-management
    CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. And to achieve dependable self-management, systematic
    solution is necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation
    decision, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls
    the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing
    flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges
    of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focus on reducing the complexity,
    we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability
    means; then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss
    the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture
    level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaption, we investigate the verification
    and validation (V&V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the
    solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaption, the
    comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing
    pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the
    technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one
    solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic
    SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on
    dependable SCPS building and evaluation. Keywords cyber physical systems; industry

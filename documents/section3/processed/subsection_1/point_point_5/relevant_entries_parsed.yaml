  data_sources: Sensor data collected from the field, weather forecasting data
  explanation: The study's primary objective is to create an automated, real-time
    irrigation system based on soil moisture and temperature dynamics that is catered
    to Maize crop growth. This system employs sensors to detect fluctuations in soil
    moisture and temperature, which are then processed by a Raspberry-Pi 3 and a Fuzzy
    Inference Controller to arrive at a decision. Based on predetermined standards,
    the system then notifies farmers via a mobile app.
  extract_1: This study presents smart irrigation project based on soil parameters
    dynamics suitable for Maize crop irrigation.
  extract_2: It uses sensors to sense variation in moisture and temperature in the
    soil, process them using Raspberry-pi 3 and Fuzzy Inference Controller for decision
    making and gives recommendation (notification message) to the farmers according
    to standards predetermined through mobile application.

  key_findings: The study found that the proposed system can significantly reduce
    water usage and energy consumption while also increasing crop productivity. Additionally,
    the system was able to maintain the soil moisture and temperature levels at the
    desired levels.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To develop a smart, low-energy irrigation system that uses sensors
    to detect fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature, and then uses a Raspberry-Pi
    3 and a Fuzzy Inference Controller to process the data and make decisions based
    on predetermined standards, and to notify farmers of those decisions via a mobile
    app.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is highly relevant to the point being made in the
    literature review, which discusses the impact of environmental factors on wireless
    data transmission in agricultural settings. The study examines the impact of environmental
    factors, such as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on the wireless transmission
    of data in an agricultural setting, particularly in the context of irrigation
    management.
